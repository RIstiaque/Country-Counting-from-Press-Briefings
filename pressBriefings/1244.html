AFT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, thanks for doing this -- we want to do this quick at the beginning.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll just say a few things and then Doug Lute will take over and he can read out the call with President Karzai and a number of the other meetings that the President had. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just talked to the President.\xc2\xa0 He was very moved by this visit and by the troops that he interacted with, by how many of the troops -- and Doug can speak to this, too -- told him that the thing that\'s on their mind is their families back home and that the American people are supporting our military families as strong as they support our troops; that the President thought it was a very good visit to get pretty substantive briefings -- and Doug can speak to this -- from different components of our team in Afghanistan as well, above all, as his time he was able to spend with the troops in various forms that Doug can speak to -- working the rope line several times, and hearing directly from them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Doug.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 The first thing I\'d highlight is just Ben\xe2\x80\x99s point about the importance and recurring theme being the importance that the troops feel about America being behind them. They do feel that support from the country.\xc2\xa0 When asked repeatedly by the President, well, what can I do for you, basically they said, just tell the American people to support our families while we\'re away.\xc2\xa0 That leaves us to focus on the mission here.\xc2\xa0 Rest assured that our families are being taken care of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was really moving to hear that.\xc2\xa0 This is from a series of groups who had not interacted.\xc2\xa0 So starting with folks we had talked to on the airplane, asking what could the President announce here, and repeatedly they said, consistently they said, support for our families.\xc2\xa0 So that was very moving.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Karzai call -- it was about a 15-minute call.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, weather and some technical difficulties between the palace and Bagram interfered with plans -- originally, obviously the plan was to go there.\xc2\xa0 But the weather intervened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also wanted to visit the embassy while we were there.\xc2\xa0 So we were unable to do that as well.\xc2\xa0 But the two Presidents spoke for about 15 minutes by telephone.\xc2\xa0 President Obama explained the primary purpose of the visit, which, as you know, was all about visiting the troops for the holiday season.\xc2\xa0 At that point President Karzai interrupted him and said, well, look, Mr. President, when you\'re thanking your troops add me to that list and tell them that President Karzai appreciates their efforts as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They went on to talk a little bit about the last time they\xe2\x80\x99d seen one another.\xc2\xa0 So this is just -- less than two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 Some of you may have been on the Lisbon trip.\xc2\xa0 They spent three or four hours together in the large format, the ISAF format meeting at Lisbon, with 39 other heads of government, heads of state.\xc2\xa0 But then more telling, they had a very meaningful one-hour bilateral session on the margins of Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 And both of them referred back to that meeting and called it the best session they had had so far.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both Presidents reviewed for one another and then reaffirmed their commitment to the two major deliverables coming out of Lisbon -- the first is this framework for security transition that is due to begin in early \xe2\x80\x9911, and then conclude by the end of \xe2\x80\x9914, when we hope -- we intend that all 34 provinces in Afghanistan will have passed onto the lead security responsibility to the Afghan security forces.\xc2\xa0 So they reaffirmed their commitment to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They both acknowledged that early 2011 is not far off and that this has to remain a priority for both of them, to begin the transition process and the build-off of the momentum set at Lisbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then they went to the second theme of Lisbon, which is this notion of an enduring commitment even beyond 2014, once the Afghans have assumed the security lead.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that in Lisbon the NATO Secretary General and President Karzai signed a declaration, a statement of intent to continue this longstanding, enduring commitment of NATO supporting Afghan security forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The two Presidents agreed that our work on a similar bilateral partnership declaration needs to continue and conclude in the early months of 2011, and we\'re on track to do that.\xc2\xa0 They both reaffirmed their commitment to finishing up this bilateral arrangement as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President briefed President Karzai only for a few moments on where we stand on the annual review.\xc2\xa0 President Karzai had actually been briefed on this in detail -- in fact, I briefed him for two hours about a month ago when the review kicked off and I spent some time with him explaining the charter from President Obama and what the review was and what the review was not.\xc2\xa0 He was comfortable with it at the time.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s given us some feedback over time to include that session about a month ago, again at Lisbon.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- our President committed to get back to him telephonically before the review -- the findings of the review are published later this month.\xc2\xa0 So they seemed to be on track on that front.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Closing out, President Karzai reminded President Obama to thank the troops on his behalf.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama wished President Karzai well for the holiday season and hoped that the weather would improve for the scheduled visit of Pakistani Prime Minister Gilani to see President Karzai tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And Karzai indicated he hoped the forecast would allow that visit. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Just before any questions, just so you have the sequence of meetings -- the President met -- when he got there, did the hospital visit, which he awarded five Purple Hearts.\xc2\xa0 He also met for about 40 minutes -- right, Doug -- with General Petraeus, Ambassador Eikenberry, Doug and Tom Donilon to just get a briefing on the situation in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He then met for about 30 minutes with the platoon that had just recently lost six members to an attack.\xc2\xa0 Doug was in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was a very powerful discussion that the President had with this platoon that recently lost six of their members. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the President gave his remarks, which you obviously saw.\xc2\xa0 Then when concluded, the President -- after he was done with the rope line he went back and he spent some time with some of our Special Forces here in Afghanistan who were able to discuss with the President their work.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Special Forces are an important part of our strategy here.\xc2\xa0 So he had a pretty full spectrum from the leadership of the civilian-military team down to the Special Forces guys who are carrying out some work, and of course a lot of our different troops from the platoon he met with, the people he spoke with at the hospital, to of course troops he spoke with in the hangar.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doug, I don\'t know if you have anything to add.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 I think the most moving -- the two most moving sessions he had were the series of meetings in the hospital where the President met six soldiers who had been wounded, several wounded American contractors.\xc2\xa0 He awarded four Purple Hearts to those wounded in combat. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Five --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Five?\xc2\xa0 I thought it was four.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Katie Lillie said it was five.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll go with Katie.\xc2\xa0 Five it is. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the second moving session was this time he spent, almost 30 minutes, with the platoon of about 20 soldiers from the 101st who were involved in this very unfortunate incident earlier in the week where they lost six soldiers in one incident.\xc2\xa0 It was very moving to see the Commander-in-Chief -- so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the entire chain of command here from the man at the top all the way down to the sergeant on the ground in a very emotional but bonding event that relates that -- even though the President sits in Washington as the Commander-in-Chief, is able to relate I thought in a very moving way -- as a former military officer -- a very moving way with these guys who have been through a very traumatic experience.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talked to each one of the members of the platoon individually, then called them into a group; recognized the leadership of the platoon, the challenges of the path ahead because now they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to recover from this incident and put their rucksacks back on and get back into the fight.\xc2\xa0 He reminded them in I thought a very telling way that they have a nation of 300 million Americans behind them and that in these times when they\xe2\x80\x99re getting through this tough period, especially in the holidays, that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel alone, and they should feel the support of the 300 million strong American nation behind them.\xc2\xa0 Then he expressed sort of the personal support he feels as Commander-in-Chief to them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He met individually and then as a group?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 He went to each man individually, shook their hands, had an exchange, and then, as you can imagine, they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of stiff and formal -- he tried to put them at ease, draw them closer in, and then just talked to them privately for a while.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About how many?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 About 20, I think.\xc2\xa0 There were about 20 in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Just so I got the sequence right -- Katie reminds me -- the call was the first thing he did --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 The call was the first thing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Then the briefing with civ-mil team --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And then the hospital, then to the hangar, and then the Special Forces guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at the hospital originally we were told he was meeting with five troops and three civilians.\xc2\xa0 Is that still accurate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll confirm the numbers for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 There were only a couple folks who go into those things because we try to keep those very discreet so that the patients aren\'t -- the wounded aren\'t so overwhelmed by a flock of people.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll get somebody who was bedside so they can tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did President Obama raise, did they discuss at all this issue of corruption within the Afghan government, particularly because that has become an issue in the news the last few days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 They have talked about this before in their periodic discussions, but it did not come up today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the following meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 These are meetings that go back now months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the meeting with Ambassador Eikenberry and General Petraeus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 So you\'re referring now to the other session, the second session?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- whether or not corruption came up in that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 It did not specifically come up in that meeting, either.\xc2\xa0 Now, you have to understand, though, that the President communicates in writing -- he receives written reports from Eikenberry and Petraeus weekly and he sees them at least once month for an extended VTC.\xc2\xa0 So this is just an opportunity to continue this sort of pattern of engagement that he has with them.\xc2\xa0 But he has talked to them before, obviously, about corruption and the challenges corruption poses for effective governance, and how important effective governance is to our mission.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not only important to Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to our mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s been a topic, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the WikiLeaks disclosures come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that came up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timing on when the embassy informed Karzai that the President was coming?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll get that -- I\'m sorry, Carol, I\'ll get that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other question on the December review -- in briefings today that the parameters are largely in place.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about progress.\xc2\xa0 He talked in Lisbon about staying with the withdrawal starting in July.\xc2\xa0 Petraeus has seen areas differently now.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like things are moving the way the President wants them to move, and this review is, as Ben said earlier, not about major policy changes.\xc2\xa0 Should we anticipate any adjustments to the strategy at all as a result of this review?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see any immediate adjustments.\xc2\xa0 The review will feature -- our charter was essentially diagnostic, meaning that the fundamental question we were charged to assess is, is this approach working? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, you can imagine that there are going to be some parts of the approach that will probably likely to be found working and others that are perhaps lagging.\xc2\xa0 So in the aftermath of the review -- so now, I\'ll say, the first six months of the new year the policy agenda will take up how can we take advantage of things that are working, right, and maybe amplify those effects, and how can we mitigate where things aren\'t working as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that process is not part of our charter between now and the end of December.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the to-do list for the rest of -- for the early part of 2011. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you will identify those aspects that are working?\xc2\xa0 That\'s the diagnostic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 The review will identify things that need to be addressed in the policy process in 2011.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- rollout of the review, you said not a big speech.\xc2\xa0 Will it be a small speech or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely set, but what I would anticipate, Caren, is some kind of statement from the President\xc2\xa0 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Written statement or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d expect it\xe2\x80\x99s something he\xe2\x80\x99d speak to, and then more extensive briefing about the review from the national security team, the senior national security team.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s another opportunity for the President, just as he did in Lisbon, to frame -- and as he did in some respects today -- to frame where we are, what we\'ve learned about the strategy, what we\'ve learned about what\xe2\x80\x99s working and about areas where we need to put additional emphasis going forward.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\'ll speak to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d just -- the speech he gave last year at the end of the policy review where he was making a major policy address to the American people about a new way forward in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 This will be more an update to the American people about how the strategy is going and how we are positioned heading into the new year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will an actual report be made public?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There will be -- I would anticipate an extensive report that is classified.\xc2\xa0 But I would also anticipate materials that would be able to be made public about the key points of the review and the key facts about where we are in Afghanistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 The real challenge here in terms of public or not public is that any review that assesses what\xe2\x80\x99s going well and what\xe2\x80\x99s not going so well is a gold mine for the enemy, because he would then obviously try to take advantage of this and so forth. So we\'ve got to be careful about keeping things private and secrets secret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll be able to lift up the top lines to give people a clearer sense of where we think we are and to do that in a public way, while there will also be a more extensive guide that is to inform the interagency process and the policy-making process moving forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unlike, frankly, the monthly assessments that have come to serve this purpose, where areas -- in the briefings the President receives and the questions that he asks, which are often based on the weekly reports he gets -- those briefings provide an update, again, as to areas of progress, areas that are lagging.\xc2\xa0 And the President, through his questioning, and the chain of command through their questioning, can give some guidance and points of reference to the team out in the country as to areas that we need to work on, maybe do a better job at, focus on going forward.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s basically a process of feedback group. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was laid out as a marker because the President wanted to make sure that we were constantly doing not just regular assessments but had the ability to step back and do kind of a comprehensive assessment as to where things stand one year after the rollout of the new policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing I\'d emphasize, too, is just as Doug has done a lot of work to tee this up with the different agencies involved who\xe2\x80\x99ve given inputs to Doug and his team at the national security staff, the Lisbon summit provides a strong foundation for the review because it established this framework of both the transition period and process as well as the long-term partnership that NATO and ISAF forged with Afghanistan in Lisbon. But as Doug said, we\'ll continue to develop a bilateral vision for a long-term partnership with Afghanistan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those issues will certainly be -- we\'ll be looking to figure out the best way forward to accomplish our goals within that context.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Lisbon actually helps us because before Lisbon we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the security transition framework that\'s in place now.\xc2\xa0 So I can tell you one element of the review that\'s going to say, hey, we\'ve made progress here is we now have in place a security transition framework, thanks to Lisbon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q On the Karzai call, how would you describe the tone and how -- was it different or the same from other phone conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Two partners who routinely engage, comfortable with one another and mutually respectful.\xc2\xa0 It was exactly what you would expect from two heads of state.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q (Inaudible) -- classified cables on the front page of The New York Times criticizing Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother.\xc2\xa0 This didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Well, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up because those cables are dated.\xc2\xa0 Most of them were dated such that as we conducted the month-long review last fall this was a major topic.\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t news to either President -- obviously.\xc2\xa0 So it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add, Jake, as somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s been working with WikiLeaks response a little more actively than Doug -- as a part of our -- well, two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is not the first WikiLeaks dump that was relevant to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We had one just entirely devoted to it.\xc2\xa0 But as a part of this WikiLeaks exposure, just as we did with embassies around the world, Secretary Clinton spoke to President Karzai about it and Ambassador Eikenberry then went in to brief the Afghan government to include President Karzai about what we expected in these WikiLeaks.\xc2\xa0 So there had already been consultation with the Afghan government about this in the previous several days, just as the State Department has been running consultations with governments around the world what we thought to be in the cables.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out, as Doug said, not only are they dated but they also speak to issues that have been in the public domain through different vehicles for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q Does the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re now out complicate Eikenberry\xe2\x80\x99s assignment at the embassy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been a very effective ambassador. Frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first cable of his that found its way into The New York Times, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s managed to, despite that kind of reporting, again, be a very good ambassador for the United States, to be a very good partner with the Afghans.\xc2\xa0 Doug works with him on a daily basis.\xc2\xa0 He can speak to that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a very challenging war that we\'re engaged in in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But we, right now, with the Afghans are aligned on our strategic priorities and that, to us, is more important than the effect of this information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q Can you give us just a little bit of behind the scenes on the decision to cancel the Kabul part, just clarify --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a couple things and then Doug can weigh in because he has more experience in this kind of thing than I do.\xc2\xa0 But every time that we do a trip like this, the military aides and the people on the ground have the ability to make what we would call a bad-weather call.\xc2\xa0 That always takes place within the last couple of hours before we land.\xc2\xa0 That\'s when our communications are turned on back here on Air Force One, as you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you saw, when Robert and I went in to brief you, it was our full expectation that we would do the lift, because we had not yet had any contact with the mil aides about this.\xc2\xa0 But in the middle of that, Alyssa came in and she had received the judgment that because of I think what were 45-mile-per-hour winds and the low ceiling, that they strongly advised against any helo lift into Kabul.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that the standard here is to defer to the experts, the weather experts and the pilots, because in this part of the world, given the elevations, given this seasonal -- we\'re in the seasonal flux now between the heavy weather coming in -- there are -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably all flown in the helicopter path from Bagram to Kabul before.\xc2\xa0 There are mountain passes, you get close through there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\'t second-guess the technical experts, the weather guys and the pilots.\xc2\xa0 They always have the last call on these kinds of decisions.\xc2\xa0 And their advice was not to make the trip. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q -- made impossible for Karzai to come to Bagram?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99d have to fly in reverse so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q Petraeus and Eikenberry came --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Petraeus and Eikenberry, when I saw them on the ground, I said, well, how long have you guys been here?\xc2\xa0 They just got through the weather and made it from Kabul.\xc2\xa0 And it will be interesting, they might end up staying there tonight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they flew through that but then the weather closed down. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q We don\'t know the technical explanation either, but initially it was citing heavy winds and low clouds.\xc2\xa0 But when we landed everybody was confused because in Kabul they said the sky was clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a 30-minute flight from Kabul to Bagram, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got elevation changes between those two locations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q -- in the mountains then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and the winds on the ground.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think you probably experienced the same winds we did.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just -- I don\'t know what the weather is now in Kabul.\xc2\xa0 I saw what the weather was in Bagram and it was quite windy.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re dealing with a pass of some 30-minute flight.\xc2\xa0 I remember from last time we made it through different elevations through the mountains.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the entire flight path has to be suitable for the helicopter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 And sustainable, too.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a question of sneaking through the weather and then ending up in Kabul.\xc2\xa0 Air Force One is back here so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have a reasonable forecast that the mission is going to be complete.\xc2\xa0 The mission is also a two-way mission. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, the bottom line here -- I\'ve been working in this theater now for six consecutive years -- you don\'t second-guess the weather and you don\'t second-guess the experts and the mountains.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\'re actually only one for three, too, because we had our first stop in Baghdad actually -- we were supposed to helo into see Talabani and Maliki and I think it was winds and sand storms that kept us down -- so we don\'t make those calls.\xc2\xa0 We defer to the people who can make them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q You said Petraeus and Eikenberry got there just before the weather closed, or did they move up their departure to get -- knowing that the weather was going to turn?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 I think my sense is that they were -- being the civilian and lead military guy, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to arrive at the last minute to greet the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 They were there for a while, making sure arrangements were right.\xc2\xa0 They noted, however, that the weather was dicey as they came in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q So it\xe2\x80\x99s not like the weather was getting worse and Karzai, at the last minute, decided --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 Again, whether Karzai is flying in our direction or we\'re flying in Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s direction, we\'ve got the inverse, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the same weather picture that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get through. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q And the SVTC didn\xe2\x80\x99t come together because of technical problems?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think we just couldn\'t pull it together in the time available.\xc2\xa0 And that was fine -- just talking by phone call. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 They said the phone call was more convenient to President Karzai, so we deferred.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 They have these SVTCs regularly, though, so I imagine we\'ll do that another -- thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check on the -- okay, so just to check on one of your questions, there were five Purple Hearts awarded.\xc2\xa0 There were six service members who the President spent time with, and two U.S. contractors. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I\'ll check the embassy notification.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q At some point can we get a tick-tock of the President before he arrived at Andrews and what he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing on the plane, some sort of background on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure, the quick version of that is, as is his\xc2\xa0 -- we actually did a briefing -- my days are screwed up -- Thursday afternoon he had a briefing on this trip led by Doug at the White House.\xc2\xa0 That was Thursday afternoon during his national security staff time. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GENERAL LUTE:\xc2\xa0 About 4:00.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
