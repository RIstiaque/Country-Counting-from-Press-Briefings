BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has been receiving regular briefings about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the Gulf from Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina, who\xe2\x80\x99s been receiving information on the ground from Carol Browner.\xc2\xa0 As you know, all eyes are on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Gulf today.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu is in Houston at the command center, and we\'re receiving information as quickly as it can come.\xc2\xa0 But for the public information and briefings and that sort of thing I would point you guys to Robert, Louisiana, the JIC, where -- the Joint Information Center -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get more information on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening as they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to put it out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s receiving regular briefings.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us just a flavor of what they\xe2\x80\x99re telling him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re just basically -- not being a scientist or expert, I don\'t want to get into the details because I get in over my depth frequently, but they\xe2\x80\x99re basically just giving him some of the information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening underground and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening above -- at sea level to mitigate the leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they said when they expect to announce whether or not the top kill is a success?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'ve heard.\xc2\xa0 But for that sort of thing I would point you to Robert [Louisiana].</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been updated on top kill and how it\xe2\x80\x99s going?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you repeat the question?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, just to repeat some of the questions, because people have been asking about what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of top kill, has he received information on top kill.\xc2\xa0 He has been receiving information on top kill.\xc2\xa0 For information about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and the latest public information that\'s available, we\'re pointing folks down to Robert, Louisiana, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll be releasing information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize his level of frustration as growing, steady, or declining with BP and the cleanup?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that his level of frustration is very high and that every moment that that hole is not plugged the President has a deep level of concern.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this has been an all-hands-on-deck approach to what has been a pretty big catastrophe and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to do everything that we can and bring in the best and brightest minds to figure out different ways that we can address this until the hole is plugged and until we\xe2\x80\x99ve mitigated the environmental disaster in and on the water.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has a reaction or is upset by the fact that the initial efforts were designed to stop the leak by recovering the oil, as opposed to, say, just plugging it up?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated by the fact that initial recovery attempts that have all failed were designed more around recovering the oil as it was being spilled, rather than just plugging the hole up?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I\xc2\xa0 would necessarily agree with that characterization, as from the beginning the goal has been to stop the oil from leaking from the bottom of the ocean and to clean up and mitigate any effects that oil was going to have on land.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a thousand government personnel down there; there are Coast Guard ships and helicopters and a wide variety of assets that are going into taking care of those two very key problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a big point of emphasizing the fact that Secretary Chu and the President have been having regular chats.\xc2\xa0 What is Secretary Chu\xe2\x80\x99s view of the top kill option and its potential for success?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into characterizing Secretary Chu and what he thinks about the science behind this, but obviously the government signed off on moving forward on this and we\'re all hoping for the best.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- details on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 On Friday -- and I know the pool report said that I would have details, even though I said I would check on details -- and the latest is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said they were expected.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It said I would have details.\xc2\xa0 That\'s Carol Lee, the pool -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 However, the advance team has put together a sketch but they\xe2\x80\x99re just now getting people on the ground to figure out exactly where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that he is going to go and see the coast and see a lot of the people who are working on this.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately I don\'t have a lot of details other than to tell you he\xe2\x80\x99s going to leave Chicago Friday morning and head down there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any sense of like who he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with or any of that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately not.\xc2\xa0 Some of the main players you can guess who they\xe2\x80\x99ll be, but I\'m not in a position to release anything right now just because it\xe2\x80\x99s not finalized just yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Thursday?\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 What about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s statement?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, in terms of tomorrow, as you all have reported, the President will talk a little bit about the Interior report and lay out some new thoughts on how to proceed on drilling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Salazar?\xc2\xa0 I know he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen the actual report, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversations.\xc2\xa0 Has he gotten some indication of what this report is going to say?\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s making recommendations tomorrow you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to assume he knows where this is going.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with each other, but in terms of the substance of those conversations and how detailed he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten about this, I\'m not a hundred percent sure.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact, but I can\'t tell you the level of granularity on the report that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to receive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how specific the President is going to get tomorrow in terms of his recommendations?\xc2\xa0 Will we be able to get specifics, or is this kind of raw and suggestions?\\</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This will be -- there will be some news to it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into what it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How might whatever these suggestions are affect the energy policy which he discussed today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously as the President had said, we\'ve seen some of the devastating costs of getting our energy from oil and from other such fossil fuels.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we have to take a comprehensive approach to this.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about the need for a comprehensive energy strategy -- he talked about it yesterday when he was with Senate Republicans. And there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of work on very good proposals, and the President is hopeful that with some of those proposals that are currently in the Senate, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to move forward and get the American people the kind of energy policy they deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How involved is the administration in coming up with other plans if top kill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?\xc2\xa0 What role does the administration have?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re in very close contact with the folks who are trying to plug this hole, and Secretary Chu -- I\'m sorry, Jackie, did you hear the question?\xc2\xa0 Jackie had her hand up.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been in close contact with the folks who are trying to plug this hole.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu has been down there with a team of scientists consulting, working with the folks at BP and the other people who are on the ground to think of new ways to mitigate this disaster.\xc2\xa0 So I would say that to the extent possible we\'re very involved in, putting all hands on deck, all lines to this task to make it stop.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many other options are being considered now?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are we looking at -- half a dozen or something?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'d be hesitant to get into how many options are actually being discussed and considered because I\'m not there and I just don\'t have the latest information.\xc2\xa0 But I would just point you down to the folks in Louisiana who would have more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, you may have answered this, but when will we know if top kill is successful?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think the answer to that is -- and again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the people who are the experts on this down in the Gulf right now.\xc2\xa0 Essentially there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of moving pieces to this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got separate pipes that are going down with separate functions and as they measure what\xe2\x80\x99s coming in and what\xe2\x80\x99s going out and the pressure and all that, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of getting the best possible information to figure out whether this is working or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 But the experts are down in the Gulf and I\xe2\x80\x99d point you down there for more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to know today or by the time the President goes on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on climate change legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President said today he thinks he can get that done by the end of year -- I mean, are you confident that you\xe2\x80\x99ll get that done by the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 Is that the goal?\xc2\xa0 Do you think Congress will be able to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President wants to get this done as soon as humanly possible.\xc2\xa0 And just like he told Republicans yesterday, he thinks a lot of hard work has already been done on this, especially by senators like Kerry and Lieberman, with some hard work from Lindsey Graham as well.\xc2\xa0 And if we all -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that if we put our shoulder to this and we put politics aside so that we can move the policy that our country so desperately needs, then we\'ll be able to get it done sooner than later.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What role does offshore drilling play in that process going forward?\xc2\xa0 I mean, clearly the game has changed a little bit because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that that\'s the very serious backdrop against which an energy policy would be made, but there are currently reviews underway to determine what happened here in this case, what the safest ways going forward will be.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s the commission that the President created as well to figure out some of these questions.\xc2\xa0 So without prejudging the outcomes of any of that, I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an important part of the discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without prejudging that, if you want to get this bill passed before the end of the year, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to happen before any conclusions come out of the commission.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\'t know how long -- what your deadline is for the commission\xe2\x80\x99s results, but clearly there have to be some conclusions made within the administration before that.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that people are looking at and figuring out the best way forward on oil policy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Department of Interior already act as it relates to permits and already act as it relates to some safety checks and things like that.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, I think you\'re right that there will be action before all the conclusions have been come to, but I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place and we\'re watching that play itself out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Action in terms of?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say you think there will be action, what do you mean?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I mean the President wants to move forward on energy policy as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about cleaning house at MMS?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'d point you to Interior.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, are there contingency plans -- if the report comes out tomorrow and it says we need to continue this moratorium on new drilling past the 30-day deadline, are there contingency plans for what happens to these leases that are supposed to come online later this summer?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that that\xe2\x80\x99s dangerously close to a hypothetical that I wouldn\'t get into before we see what happens tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this could go one of two ways -- Salazar could come back tomorrow and say, okay, we figured out what the problem is, we can continue on; or he could come back and whatever the recommendations are, say we have to halt this.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 When the word \xe2\x80\x9ccould\xe2\x80\x9d is in the question it\xe2\x80\x99s my textbook definition of a hypothetical.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you know what I\'m saying, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I hear what you\'re saying and I think that people will react to the report accordingly.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I switch topics for a second?\xc2\xa0 Republicans are -- some Republicans are calling for Attorney General Holder to look into Congressman Sestak\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the White House offered him a job to get out of the race.\xc2\xa0 Would that be something that the White House would be supportive of?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I saw that report just before we took off, but I don\'t have anything for you on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you interested in having that looked into by the Justice Department?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth looking into by the Justice Department?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, I saw the report but I don\'t have anything new for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do in Chicago on Saturday and Sunday?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to hang out with his family and friends and enjoy one of America\xe2\x80\x99s great cities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hockey game?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say that there is no public schedule for that day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been back in a long time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, has he talked about how he feels about returning with the whole family after a year and a couple of months?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously excited to get back to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 If it were up to him, he\xe2\x80\x99d be able to spend a lot more time there, but the pressures of the job keep him in Washington quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 But, no, he really is looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great city where he has a lot of great friends and he really can\'t wait to get there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any kind of a preview of his meeting with the President of Liberia tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 That\'s tomorrow, right?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether or not the President is talking to the Prime Minister of Japan at all today about the base?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'ve heard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans for him to talk to him today?\xc2\xa0 Because we heard that there was going to be a conversation today.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'ve heard.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give any details, Bill, about what his meetings with Netanyahu will discuss next week?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that it would be safe to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a long talk about where we are in the process, where we are in proximity talks, and what the best way forward is.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of specific substance and detail I don\'t have much for you.\xc2\xa0 That was just announced earlier today with Rahm in Israel.\xc2\xa0 So we will definitely keep you posted on what we hope to discuss and get out of that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Rahm about his visit?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know for sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close is Obama to picking a new DNI?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any update for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any follow-up to the National Guard going down to the Arizona border, any follow-up on that at all?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That was a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to making sure that we have secure borders.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99s thought has been important over the last 16 months, and as he told Republican senators yesterday, he\xe2\x80\x99s done a lot more in terms of enforcement and border security than had been done previously.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue those efforts.\xc2\xa0 And again, like he told those Republican senators, any comprehensive immigration reform he thinks would include strong border security and enforcement of existing laws.\xc2\xa0 So this is just one part of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, one more back on the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 You may have answered this one as well, but what does the President think, or what is he doing about the fact that it was his administration that approved this permit for BP to drill and expedited it without the -- making an exception from the environmental impact statements?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is a question that has been talked about throughout this catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about it today, recently.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 -- talked about a lot of things today, recently.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This is a pretty big environmental catastrophe and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President is deeply concerned about and feels a lot of sympathy for folks in the Gulf who are threatened by this tragedy.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on plugging that hole and making sure that we clean up the mess.\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll focus on the best way forward as it relates to policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Apparently we\'ve had a lot of offers of help from other countries and groups and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been-- or most have been turned down.\xc2\xa0 Any reason why?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What are you referring to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the specifics, but many other countries apparently have called offering help in terms of resources or expertise or anything like that and they say they\xe2\x80\x99ve been turned away or saying, no, we don\'t need it.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What countries?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I said I don\'t know the specific countries off the top of my head.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'d be interested in hearing more on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, has the President spoken with the chief executive of BP, Tony Hayward, directly since this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you something else about last night.\xc2\xa0 The President was pretty strong against -- in talking about Republicans and what happened in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Was he frustrated with what was coming out of the Hill, what Republicans were saying?\xc2\xa0 Where did that come from?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, I would say we had a pretty good laugh about it on Air Force One, actually, to read some of the press reports of how hot and tense people described this meeting as.\xc2\xa0 I think even as Senator Cornyn said, it was not that hot or tense of a meeting.\xc2\xa0 People went in there, they asked questions, there was a good exchange, it was pretty civil.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think maybe -- like Senator Corker, for example, maybe his heart was racing a little fast when he was talking to the President, but it was not an exchange where anybody thought it was particularly tense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So when you saw the President talking about that meeting and bipartisanship last night, it was just an extension of taking a look at some of what had come out and making the point that maybe we just have a different definition of bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 To the President, bipartisanship isn\xe2\x80\x99t just making deals for the sake of making deals so you can call something bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 He always said that -- and he said this in the meeting yesterday -- he would have loved to have gotten 70 or 80 votes on financial regulatory reform in the Senate, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to do it at the cost of watering down that bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you said you were laughing, who was laughing?\xc2\xa0 Who was \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 You, him?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I was just talking about a conversation I had with the President where we were laughing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was decided that he was going to address it in the way he did when you were -- like on the flight, or when did you --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into how it all came about, he decided he wanted -- he was going to talk about it and he just did.\xc2\xa0 That part of it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that premeditated; he just talked a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so tense, why the sarcasm as in \xe2\x80\x9cwarm and cuddly,\xe2\x80\x9d and the laughter in his speech?\xc2\xa0 He said very sarcastically, it was warm and cuddly.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, if we have a matrix of \xe2\x80\x9cwarm and cuddly\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9chot and tense,\xe2\x80\x9d and where it all laid -- this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like he was going to his Bible study or something like that with all of his neighbors.\xc2\xa0 It was a meeting with the opposition party, right?\xc2\xa0 So there was applause when he left.\xc2\xa0 People thought that it was a productive exchange.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly did.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep talking to Republicans because he thinks that no one party has a monopoly on good ideas and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep going to Republicans and getting their input.</p>\n<p>But again, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make a bill bipartisan at the cost of making it weaker for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize the applause as enthusiastic or tepid?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Super psyched.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were moments in the televised meeting with the House Republicans where it was sort of tense and he gave as good as he got, even though it was all very polite.\xc2\xa0 How would you compare the meeting with the Senate Republicans in terms of the one to the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 meeting that was -- the televised meeting to the --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It was kind of a different meeting just in the sense that the House Republican meeting was so much bigger.\xc2\xa0 This meeting yesterday was a much more intimate affair.\xc2\xa0 There were about 35 or so senators, couple members of staff, as opposed to a couple hundred Republicans at the other meeting.</p>\n<p>But I would say that the tone was pretty similar -- pretty civil, pretty good exchange, moments of disagreement but nothing that was particularly hot or --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he want it to be leaked to the press?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- ask to open it up and who said no?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who had the conversations but we did want it to be open and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to be open.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, obviously we wish it would have been open so that you guys could have all just seen it and then we could just talk about some of the exchanges, as opposed to what those guys said on the way out, what I\'ve got to say to help correct the record.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s office says that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t contacted about it.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you find out who you guys reached out to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else we should be asking?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is a record for gaggles.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Twenty-one minutes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We outlasted Burton -- Burton outlasted us -- excuse me.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for coming.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n4:01 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
