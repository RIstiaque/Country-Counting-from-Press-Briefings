Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">12:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements.\xc2\xa0 You obviously heard the President speak in the Rose Garden earlier this morning.\xc2\xa0 I will have a week ahead at the end of the briefing if you remind me to give it.</p>\n<p class="p3">With that, I go to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to run HHS has experience, really, at the top levels in economics and in philanthropy and in government management, but not a lot of experience with health care.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have an HHS nominee that has experience in health care?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Sylvia Mathews Burwell has, as Director of the Office of Management and Budget, a significant role to play in the health care arena.\xc2\xa0 That office obviously interacts directly with the Department of HHS and others on matters of health care policy and implementation of that policy.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s also, as the President noted, had experience in health care issues with MetLife and with the Walmart Foundation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.\xc2\xa0 Then there is the importance of having somebody like Sylvia Burwell, with her enormous skill in management, running an agency involved in implementing the Affordable Care Act at this critical time.\xc2\xa0 And I know the President feels that there is no one more qualified than she is at this time to be at the helm of that agency.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans in the Senate are already indicating that being confirmed for OMB is a different thing than being confirmed for HHS Secretary, and that while Reid may have wanted to downplay opportunities to have discussions about Obamacare, that this presents a new opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting that her confirmation hearing will devolve into a fight about the merits of Obamacare?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict, but I would point to the fact that roughly a year ago she was confirmed 96-0.\xc2\xa0 I would point to statements by Republican senators and other Republicans just today, praising Sylvia Burwell as OMB Director and as a nominee to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.\xc2\xa0 Those comments, and that praise, is merited because she is an exceptional Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">As the President noted, on her watch, the budget deficit has declined significantly.\xc2\xa0 She was integral to the team that enabled a two-year deal to be met on the budget that for the first time in a long time ensured that we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be engaging in this kind of brinksmanship that led to the shutdown of the government, but puts us back in the business of focusing on the economy and job creation in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s not disruptive, but -- or at least less disruptive and more helpful to the American people.</p>\n<p class="p5">So we obviously defer to the Senate in its important role in confirming nominees.\xc2\xa0 But given that they confirmed her to a Cabinet position a year ago, unanimously, and that in the interim she has performed admirably and ably in that position, and has earned the praise of Democrats and Republicans alike, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to expect that she would be confirmed swiftly.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress has now passed the Iran envoy bill, and it\xe2\x80\x99s on its way to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not there already.\xc2\xa0 Will the President sign it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 We have informed the United Nations and Iran that we will not issue a visa to Mr. Abutalebi.\xc2\xa0 We certainly share the intent of the bill passed by Congress, as we have already told the U.N. and Iran that we will not issue a visa.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll review the legislation; we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that now.\xc2\xa0 And we will work to address any issues related to its utility and constitutionality.\xc2\xa0 But we share the intent of the bill.\xc2\xa0 The bill expands upon a 1990 law for which President George H.W. Bush issued a signing statement expressing constitutional concerns.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, we will be looking at this issue as part of our review.\xc2\xa0 But as to the intent, we share it.\xc2\xa0 And I think we have made clear in previous statements and today in my statement that we won\xe2\x80\x99t be issuing a visa.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify, in recent days you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that you had told the Iranians that this is not viable.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve told the Iranians that the U.S. won\xe2\x80\x99t issue visas.\xc2\xa0 So is that a follow-up conversation that occurred to let them know that there will not --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated with the Iranians at a number of levels and made clear our position on this.\xc2\xa0 And that includes our position that the selection was not viable and our position that we will not be issuing him a visa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Roberta.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How will not issuing him a visa affect ongoing talks?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do not expect them to.\xc2\xa0 You mean on the P5-plus-1?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="p6">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place with our partners</p>\n<p class="p2">on the P5-plus-1 that is moving forward in a workmanlike manner and that we do not expect to be affected by this decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is totally separate?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Back to what Josh was asking, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can say to what extent the nomination of Sylvia Mathews Burwell is kind of like a fresh start for Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 And to what extent do you feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to ease complaints and concerns leading up to November elections?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 Echoing the President, I would note that Secretary Sebelius oversaw that agency during an historic period through the drafting and passage of the Affordable Care Act and through the multi-year implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Because she was in the lead, she was a vessel for a lot of partisan attack and vitriol, but she kept focused on the job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And what I think is most notable about this moment is that despite the troubles that we forthrightly acknowledge that the Affordable Care Act got in its rollout of the healthcare.gov website, today we can say that 7.5 million Americans enrolled in the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not counting the 3 million young adults who are on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not counting the millions more who are able to get health care through the expanded Medicaid program in those states where the expansion was accepted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And Secretary Sebelius deserves credit for all of that through her leadership at HHS.\xc2\xa0 She came to the President in early March confident that March would be a strong month in enrollment and that we would end the open enrollment period in a good place, and said that the end of enrollment was a good time for her to step aside after five years in the Cabinet, five years at the helm of this agency -- a good time for her personally, a good time for the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 What you will see in the role that future Secretary Burwell plays is effective management of the implementation going forward, as well as of all of the other programs and policies that HHS has responsibility for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think we will not see anyone here contest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through a rocky period, especially October and November, when it comes to healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 But I will contest the idea that the Affordable Care Act needs a fresh start -- because we saw this fresh start, if you will, in the dramatic improvement of the functionality of the website and in the astounding demand for the product provided through healthcare.gov and provided through the state marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re about the business of continuing to implement the law.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re about the business of preparing for the next open enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 And Sylvia Burwell will be an excellent leader of that effort.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so do you think her nomination then will help put that period behind you?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, so that\xe2\x80\x99s your second question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out of the business of political analysis for a few years.\xc2\xa0 But it astounds me when I see purported professionals --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like riding a bike.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s even easier than that, apparently, because it astounds me when I see supposed professional political analysts suggest that the name of the person at the head of the Department of Health and Human Services -- an agency that most Americans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t even know exist -- will affect how they vote in November.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">What will matter, surely, is whether or not they signed up successfully for quality and affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 What will matter is whether or not they feel the candidate in their district or state has an agenda that speaks to them, that reflects an effort to reward hard work and responsibility; to expand our opportunity in this country for folks in the middle class and those working to get into the middle class; that protects the rights of women in the workplace; and make sure that families across the country have the capacity to send their children to college.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">I think those issues will matter.\xc2\xa0 And when I said that, it was obviously a little hyperbole and little bit of a joke, and not in any way meant to play down the importance of that agency and the work it does, but people don\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time out in the country thinking about who\xe2\x80\x99s heading up departments here.\xc2\xa0 They spend a lot of time wondering whether Washington is working for them.\xc2\xa0 And I think that when it comes to debates about the Affordable Care Act, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make their assessments based on their personal experience, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make their judgments in the fall based on a lot of other issues.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jim Acosta.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to Secretary Sebelius and when she informed the President that she would like to step down, did the President ask her to reconsider at that point?\xc2\xa0 And did she ever fall out a favor with the President, with people high up in the White House, in terms of her management of the Affordable Care Act and the website?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Sebelius came to the President in early March, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, having made up her mind that the end of open enrollment would be the right time for her personally, and for the agency, to step aside.\xc2\xa0 They had a number of discussions about it, and the President accepted her resignation.\xc2\xa0 But I think you heard today in the Rose Garden how the President feels about Kathleen Sebelius and her efforts.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you need me to tell you, because he told you himself.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask her to reconsider?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into private conversations between him and any Cabinet Secretary.\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Sebelius has made clear, and we have echoed her decision, that she felt it was the right time to go.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget, that\xe2\x80\x99s after five years in the Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty long tenure -- and at the head of an agency that has overseen historic change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So the President greatly appreciates her service and greatly appreciates the fact that when times were tough Secretary Sebelius rolled up her sleeves and focused on fixing the problem.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President asked of everybody.\xc2\xa0 He stood here and he took responsibility as President, as head of this administration, for the problems with healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 And every member of that team took responsibility.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t look to assign blame or point fingers or scapegoat anyone.\xc2\xa0 He wanted every member of that team who was committed to providing affordable, quality health insurance to the American people to get to work fixing the problems for the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he demanded, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he got.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that vein, I just want to follow -- because it is sort of a notion in Washington that this President does not like to throw people overboard; that he bristles at calls for Cabinet secretaries to be fired, emanating from up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is any of that true?\xc2\xa0 Is there a part of this President he just sort of says to hell with it -- his critics?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this President holds people accountable and believes they ought to perform at the highest levels, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he saw people do when we had the problems that we had last fall with the website.\xc2\xa0 As a general principle, I think President Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t subscribe to practices that are theatrical, in personnel or other areas.\xc2\xa0 Because again -- this goes to sort of Roberta\xe2\x80\x99s question -- the issue with healthcare.gov wasn\xe2\x80\x99t who\xe2\x80\x99s to blame; it was can they get it to work.\xc2\xa0 Because it was about a tool that was highly important to making implementation of the Affordable Care Act successful.</p>\n<p class="p4">So what did the President do?\xc2\xa0 He looked at the troubles and he said, here\xe2\x80\x99s the course we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pursue; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to throw everything in we have at fixing this problem.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring in a team of tech experts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask Jeff Zients to come in and oversee that team, under CMS and HHS, and fix the problem.\xc2\xa0 Because what mattered most was fixing it so that folks could enroll, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to the Iranians\xe2\x80\x99 pick for ambassador to the U.N. -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you said whether or not the President would sign that legislation.\xc2\xa0 Is that not necessary now?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I said was that we are reviewing the legislation and will work to address any issues related to its utility and its constitutionality.\xc2\xa0 And I pointed you to the precedent here in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush, when he issued a signing statement, when he signed a bill expressing constitutional concerns that he and his administration had at the time.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll look at that precedent as well.</p>\n<p class="p5">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jay, so many critics of the law still have so many questions about those 7 million Americans who signed up.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 7.5.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 7.5.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important to answer some of those questions before these confirmation hearings?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think the confirmation hearings are the appropriate place to have these questions answered?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the senators will have lots of questions for the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, as is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule -- it\xe2\x80\x99s up to them what they want to ask her, and certainly questions about the Affordable Care Act represent fair ground.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But, I mean, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me about -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which questions you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to -- demographic breakdowns?\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of the above.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House going to break down that 7.5 million number prior to her confirmation?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We will have data available when the data is reliable enough to provide.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that every time a bar is set by critics and opponents of the Affordable Care Act that they say represents the threshold for failure and we clear it, they move it to something else.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to -- when it comes to how many are -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll even anticipate some of these questions -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the percentage of uninsured now in the wake of the Affordable Care Act?\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know definitively.\xc2\xa0 But there have been some studies from outside groups that suggest a pretty significant movement in that arena as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And one study didn\xe2\x80\x99t even take into account the surge at the end of March.</p>\n<p class="p2">The demographic breakdown, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet.\xc2\xa0 And when we have the data, when it\xe2\x80\x99s scrubbed, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide it.\xc2\xa0 But insurers will tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with the demographic breakdown that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting, the individual private insurance companies have been getting who have and offer plans throughout these marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll be answering every question that we get to the best of our ability.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that he hopes there\xe2\x80\x99s a swift confirmation.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of wishful thinking on his part, just given the polarization of the Affordable Care Act still?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Was the Affordable Care Act -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s polarization as a matter of fact and regret, I think for a lot of folks.\xc2\xa0 But that polarization existed when the President had a number of nominees to Cabinet positions confirmed in the last year.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements from Republicans today already, supportive of Ms. Burwell and her work as Director of OMB and her nomination as Secretary of HHS.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to presuppose the outcome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What I will note is that the United States Senate confirmed her to a Cabinet position, a very important one, unanimously a year ago.\xc2\xa0 And what has changed in a year in the arena for which she held responsibility is that the deficit has been cut in half at a record pace, or been cut at a record pace.\xc2\xa0 For the first time in many years, a budget agreement has been reached that prevented the kind of brinksmanship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past that led in one instance to the shutdown of the government.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen overall highly effective management out of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a record that will assist us in making the case for the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re making the case that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to depend entirely on her record when that seems to be the furthest thing from the truth.\xc2\xa0 This is an opportunity to reopen the discussion of ACA on the part of the Republicans.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noted that it had been closed, first of all.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- for better or worse, in terms of their political aims, Republicans have dropped the argument and the case and are suddenly going to take it up again.\xc2\xa0 We hear every day that they want to repeal it, and that they want to tell those 7.5 million people that they\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck and tell the 3 million young adults that they\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck, and tell all those seniors who have gotten prescription drug benefits that they\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck and that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go back to the status quo ante when insurance companies could decide for you whether or not your condition was covered.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what makes you think that they\xe2\x80\x99ll consider Ms. Burwell\xe2\x80\x99s nomination on her merits alone or even at all?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s how the process is supposed to work.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Supposed to.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re optimists.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xc2\xa0 Ed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You anticipated all of my questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to first ask about voter ID before health care, because the President gave this big speech at the LBJ Library yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Before he spoke -- I think the day before -- former President Clinton talked about voter ID laws and specifically said that one way to deal with this may be to put a photo on a Social Security card.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s still controversy over that -- some support, some oppose.\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the President on it?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity to review all of the implications of that idea that Bill Clinton and others have put forward.\xc2\xa0 But generally speaking on the question of voting rights, President Obama believes we should be making it easier and not harder for every eligible citizen to vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a position he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed on many occasions.\xc2\xa0 So we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really seen a formal proposal or had a lot of time to review the one that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But as a general principle, the President is interested in making it easier for eligible citizens to vote, not harder.\xc2\xa0 Not everyone in public office seems to have the same perspective.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, midterm elections -- you said people won\xe2\x80\x99t care about who is sort of running a department, they\xe2\x80\x99ll care about whether they got new insurance coverage or not.\xc2\xa0 You specifically said that\xe2\x80\x99s what will matter.\xc2\xa0 Will it also matter if someone had a plan, the President said you can keep your plan and then they lost their plan?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there will be debate in every race about this and many other issues.\xc2\xa0 Again, you might have missed it -- I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen it on your network -- but that RAND study noted the number of individuals for whom that was the case, at least based on their survey.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, the White House has also taken issue with the RAND study, because there\xe2\x80\x99s parts of it -- and I specifically did not use it in a piece a couple of days ago because I spoke to a White House official who told me that they felt the RAND study left out a lot of important information, so just to be clear.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that may be the case.\xc2\xa0 But in any event, Ed, I have no doubt that all of the issues that surround the Affordable Care Act will be discussed in the months ahead and maybe discussed in individual races.\xc2\xa0 What I know for a fact is that the alternative we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far from Republicans is nothing.\xc2\xa0 There is no alternative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And so, if you\xe2\x80\x99re for repeal, that means that you have to make the argument that it would be better for those 7.5 million not to have been able to enroll and get quality, affordable health insurance; it would be better for the 3 million young adults who are now on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies because of the Affordable Care Act not to be able to do that; it would be better for women around the country to be charged double for the same policy that men are charged, because insurance companies could do that and that was allowed prior to the Affordable Care Act; it would be better for insurance companies to refuse to cover specific conditions because they were preexisting, to refuse to give you affordable health insurance because your child has asthma or diabetes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the status quo ante, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the argument I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing play out over the next several months.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if you were talking about two different RAND studies, But there was a RAND study a few days ago suggesting that a lot of the people who had signed up were not previously uninsured, and there were issues the administration has taken with that one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you were talking about another one.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think one RAND study I saw, and also a survey by Gallup, suggested that the number of the -- the uninsurance rate, the rate of uninsured -- including RAND -- has gone down significantly since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A big picture question on health care.\xc2\xa0 The President said, look, there were glitches in the first quarter of the game, basically, but that what matters is the final score.\xc2\xa0 And he mentioned the 7.5 million signups that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned here.\xc2\xa0 Is that the way the President views it, that that is the final score?\xc2\xa0 Or are we still in the second quarter on this?\xc2\xa0 Where are we?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to stay in metaphors related to football.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the only one he\xe2\x80\x99s cited.\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, he said signups --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was citing the first open enrollment period, which came to a conclusion on March 31st at midnight, and by which deadline, including those who have been processed since because they were already in line, at least 7.5 million people were able to enroll -- which I think given where we were in October and November and December and January and February is a pretty impressive achievement.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was referring to.</p>\n<p class="p2">What we also made clear -- and the President did today in the Rose Garden -- is that there is a lot of work to do on implementation of the Affordable Care Act, on preparing for the next period of open enrollment.\xc2\xa0 And that work continues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s work that Sylvia Burwell will be overseeing, we hope, as Secretary of HHS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of -- the White House\xe2\x80\x99s sense of urgency about now filling the OMB slot?\xc2\xa0 There is a two-year budget agreement in place, so does that like reduce the imperative to get someone confirmed?\xc2\xa0 Or is it more urgent because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of details to work out?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a short list?\xc2\xa0 How soon do you want this done?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other personnel announcements to make on top of the big ones we made today.\xc2\xa0 We expect a May transition at HHS.\xc2\xa0 And when we have further personnel announcements to make, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make them.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any kind of a short list right now?\xc2\xa0 Are you looking at replacements?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on those kind of internal deliberations when it comes to filling personnel posts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you committed to a formal nomination process where somebody is nominated to be the next Director of OMB?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into those kinds of discussions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused today on the announcement about HHS.\xc2\xa0 And when we have more personnel announcements to make, or a personnel announcement to make in this regard, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.</p>\n<p class="p4">Mark.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what reason did the U.S. give to the U.N. and Iran for denying the visa to the ambassador?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, we have obviously expressed our views directly to the Iranians, as well as the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a fair amount of reporting on this nominee, or this selection, and the concerns expressed in the legislation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about today reflect our concerns about this selection.\xc2\xa0 And for those reasons, we concur with the Congress and share the intent of the bill, and we will not be issuing a visa to the nominee.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you view the individual\xe2\x80\x99s background as having had a role in the hostage-taking in 1979?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the discussions around this, the reporting on it, the views expressed in the discussions on Capitol Hill and in the legislation itself reflect our views.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you stopping short of saying --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m agreeing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But these are complex issues, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t as a rule get into too much detail about issuing visas and deliberations over visas.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As host nation, is the U.S. entitled to withhold a visa from an ambassador?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the United Nations representation -- the U.S. representation at the U.N., as well as the State Department.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and one last question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a large gap in the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule tonight in New York.\xc2\xa0 What are the President and Mrs. Obama doing in New York tonight?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, my colleague, Eric Schultz, will be on the trip and he\xe2\x80\x99ll apprise the pool further on the schedule, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say the President and the First Lady will be spending a little time in New York this evening.\xc2\xa0 When we have more details to provide, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Date night?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, when we have more details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you give us a refresher -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say a weekend update on the latest President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations, thoughts with the leaders of NATO regarding Putin, Ukraine, Crimea, and the Russian troop buildup, et cetera?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President spoke with Chancellor Merkel yesterday from Air Force One about the concerning situation in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We continue to see there that pro-Russian separatists, apparently with support from Moscow, continue an orchestrated campaign of incitement and sabotage to undermine and destabilize the Ukrainian state.\xc2\xa0 And we remain concerned about increased Russian pressure on Ukraine overall.\xc2\xa0 And we saw similar protest activities in Crimea before the Russian intervention and illegal annexation, so this of course if cause for concern.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President and the Chancellor talked about the need for Russia to move its troops back from the border region.\xc2\xa0 In Crimea, we also continue to call for Russia to withdraw its forces, which are violating Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 As we have said, we will hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine, whether overt or covert.</p>\n<p class="p2">We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilize Ukraine, and we caution against further military intervention.\xc2\xa0 We remain prepared to impose further costs on Russia for its actions or further provocations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">When it comes to NATO and the important work underway to reassure NATO allies, the United States has urgently been stepping up on a bilateral basis to reassure our NATO allies who are most concerned by the Russian intervention in Ukraine and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s buildup of military forces.\xc2\xa0 To date, those efforts have been mostly taken advantage -- have mostly taken advantage of existing missions, such as deploying 12 additional F-16s to our aviation training detachment to Poland, and augmenting our contribution to the NATO-Baltic Air Policing Mission with six additional F-16s.</p>\n<p class="p4">As you know, while in Europe, the President asked those NATO allies who are capable of making similar contributions to do so as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 This was done with a view to moving this discussion more formally into NATO channels by tasking NATO\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Allied Commander, General Breedlove, at the NATO Foreign Ministerial to develop additional measures to enhance our collective defense and ensure a coordinated and continuous additional land, air, and sea presence in the region from now through at least the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 In other words, moving from an ad-hoc \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition of the ready\xe2\x80\x9d approach to a more concerted and strategic look at what NATO can and should do to bolster its Article 5 obligations and assurances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">In other words, we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a lot of steps to reassure our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 We have had discussions with, when the President was in Europe and since, our partners on other contributions that our NATO allies can make in the effort to reassure the alliance and those nations that are understandably most concerned by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President prepared to move Sylvia Burwell into HHS in an acting capacity if you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t get the speedy confirmation that you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping for?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about something like that, because she was confirmed 96-0 to a Cabinet position a year ago and has completed a year of exemplary service in that Cabinet position that has won her plaudits from Democrats and Republicans alike.\xc2\xa0 So we do hope for a swift confirmation, even as we defer to the Senate in the performance of its responsibilities with confirmation.\xc2\xa0 So we expect a May transition.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even a May transition is not a long time for there to be confirmation hearings.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a period without an HHS Secretary, is that --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to speculate about something like that, because we do expect a swift confirmation, or hope for a swift confirmation.\xc2\xa0 Again, she received swift confirmation and unanimous confirmation a year ago to her current position and is an excellent choice, as some Republicans have today said publicly, for this new position.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be a period where it seems there --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what might happen if something might; if, could be the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Yes, Nadia.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian oppositions are reporting that the Syrian government is using poison gas outside of Damascus.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a confirmation of that?\xc2\xa0 And if this is the case, what\xe2\x80\x99s the implication for President Assad?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are aware of these reports but do not have any information independently to corroborate those claims at this time.\xc2\xa0 We take all reports of alleged chemical weapons use seriously, which is why we are working urgently with the OPCW and U.N. to remove and destroy Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpiles.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously monitoring that situation and seeking to corroborate the reports.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Palestinian issue, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said that the Palestinian Authority is eligible to join the Geneva Convention.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong of them doing that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s an organization that respects international law and calls for the protection of civilians.</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, unilateral actions by either the Israelis or the Palestinians that do not contribute to moving the peace process forward but do the opposite are not helpful. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear our view on those actions by the Palestinians and by the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly is the case when it comes to ascension to some of these international organizations.</p>\n<p class="p4">So our views on this and the fact that both parties need to make difficult decisions that only they can make to move the process forward are very well known.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you see the difference between building settlements, undermining the possibility of a viable Palestinian state, and joining international organizations that basically protects women and children?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Nadia, what we oppose are unilateral actions that make achieving peace harder, and we oppose them whether they are settlement tenders or circulating ascension documents to various international treaties, because they make the peace process more difficult and the prospects of making progress and reaching a peace settlement more remote.\xc2\xa0 And we strongly believe it is in the interest of Israelis and Palestinians to achieve a peace settlement that allows for a sovereign Palestinian state and a secure Jewish, democratic State of Israel.</p>\n<p class="p5">Kristen, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Jay, some members of Congress are indicating that they were caught off guard by the announcement of Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.\xc2\xa0 Did President Obama alert any members of Congress, any congressional leaders?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we went through notifications in the manner that we normally do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mark?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing I was mumbling.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to join me up here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would liven things up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It would be pretty awesome, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 One day, if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Again, we went through a normal notification process.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of deliberations that the President needs to engage in directly with the Cabinet Secretary and potential nominee, and that was the case.\xc2\xa0 But again, the normal process was followed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, congressional leaders, he alerted -- you alerted congressional leaders?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Through a normal -- the normal process, yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I apologize if you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten this question already.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is going to speak later today at the National Action Network.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about voting rights.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Andrew Young, some other -- some rights leaders and others are suggesting that President Obama should issue an executive action that would put pictures on Social Security cards.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did get this question.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You did get the question, apologies.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I said, Kristen, is that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had an opportunity to review all the implications of that idea, which I think is the one that former President Clinton also discussed.</p>\n<p class="p2">But generally speaking on the subject of voting rights, President Obama believes strongly that we should be making it easier -- not harder -- for every eligible citizen to vote.\xc2\xa0 But on this specific proposal, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to review it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it something the President would rule out?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to characterize the view since we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to review it.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any type of preview of today\xe2\x80\x99s speech?\xc2\xa0 Will he be introducing any new ideas as it pertains to voting rights, improving voting rights?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you the President will make the case that every American should have the chance to know their elections are being administered fairly and efficiently, and that every eligible citizen who wants to vote should have the chance to vote.</p>\n<p class="p2">He will also reiterate his view that we should be working to make it easier and not harder to vote, and he will address some of the barriers that have recently been erected that make it more difficult for Americans to exercise one of our most fundamental rights as citizens.</p>\n<p class="p2">I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that in a democracy voting is an essential and basic right.\xc2\xa0 And we should be making sure that systems are in place and procedures are in place that make it easier for eligible American citizens to cast their ballot.\xc2\xa0 And efforts that do the opposite would seem to go at the heart of what democratic government is all about -- in a bad way.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What barriers to voting do you mean?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President I think will discuss some of those in his remarks.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes.\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Did the President not want to meet with some of the other victims of the previous shooting at Fort Hood when he was there?\xc2\xa0 Some had requested and written Denis McDonough.\xc2\xa0 As you know, they consider it an act of terrorism, and the military has not classified it as that.\xc2\xa0 And a couple of those who were grievously wounded had asked to meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t he?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously went to participate in a memorial ceremony for those who were just killed at Fort Hood.</p>\n<p class="p2">On the question of terrorism, the Department of Defense has the lead on the investigation with support from the FBI.\xc2\xa0 And the DOD has said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no indication that this incident is related to terrorism, although we are not ruling anything out.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But that investigation continues.</p>\n<p class="p2">But again, on the schedule beyond that, I don\'t have anything for you.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But for those who were injured in 2009 who have been appealing for some time now for a change, and that, as you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s been so far adjudged to be a workplace shooting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have anything new for you on that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has anybody or will anybody be fired at HHS over the website startup?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you were here, but I talked about the fact that the President when we had the malfunction of the healthcare.gov site was focused on making sure that his team was putting everything into fixing the problem, and not scapegoating and not finger-pointing and not blaming.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he got.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have 7.5 million Americans who were able to enroll successfully through the marketplaces -- both federal and state marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the kind of accountability the President wants, and that\'s what he got.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as we were discussing earlier, the debate won\xe2\x80\x99t end with the end of open enrollment, the 7.5 million, with a change of leadership at HHS, the debate will continue, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to discuss it.\xc2\xa0 The debate becomes I think a little more complicated for opponents of the Affordable Care Act, for supporters of repeal when they have to argue that the status quo ante for those 7.5 million and for the 3 million young adults and for the millions of seniors and for everyone who is affected by a policy, or was affected by a policy in the past, that discriminated against those with preexisting conditions that that\xe2\x80\x99s better for them.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Case closed on the October start?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t make personnel speculation here.\xc2\xa0 I think that the point I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make is that what the President wanted people to focus on at a very difficult time was fixing the problem, not assigning blame for the problem, and that\'s what he got.\xc2\xa0 And he got that to the benefit of millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to take one more stab at Isaac\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Will Secretary Sebelius stay on until a successor is confirmed by the Senate?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We expect a May transition, and we expect the Senate to take up Sylvia\xe2\x80\x99s confirmation and to examine her exceptional credentials, her exemplary service, and to confirm her hopefully unanimously as they did last time.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President you said knew in early March that this transition would be happening.\xc2\xa0 The President earlier today was effusive in his praise for Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 But Secretary Sebelius was not at the podium, nor was she mentioned in the remarks on April 1, when the President took what a lot -- I felt like a lot of us described as a victory lap, saying seven-point something million Americans at the time.\xc2\xa0 Was that\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Sebelius was at the event.\xc2\xa0 The President was there only with the Vice President behind the podium.\xc2\xa0 And I think you heard from the President --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He thanked members of Congress who passed --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, honestly, I think you heard from the President of --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- pool\xe2\x80\x99s omission?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Boy, that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty lame.\xc2\xa0 But the President I think gave you plenty of sound today on his feelings about Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s service.\xc2\xa0 So you got it from him and you got it pretty clearly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">I\xe2\x80\x99ll take Laura, then Jen.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Guantanamo, the Miami Herald sent a letter of protest to Secretary Hagel about the unprecedented censorship going on for the press in the past three months in Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question and probably refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So one question -- can you confirm Angela Merkel is coming to the White House in May to speak with --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling announcements on behalf of the Chancellor of Germany.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It did mention it I think in the readout, something about the upcoming visit.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Whatever we said in the readout was 100 percent true.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have the readout in front of me.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jen.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President so reluctant to take executive action on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jen, the President believes that Congress ought to pass and send to his desk the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about executive orders, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the answer I\xe2\x80\x99ve given in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">We believe that passage of ENDA, as the Senate already has done, is the right thing for the House to do.\xc2\xa0 The folks who oppose it, oppose it for the reasons that civil rights legislation has been opposed in the past.\xc2\xa0 Those reasons were wrong in the past.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the very people who oppose this one would agree that the reasons were wrong in the past with previous civil rights legislation.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that 10 years from now or however long from now the folks will look back and acknowledge that they were wrong now.\xc2\xa0 So they ought to just pass it.</p>\n<p class="p2">And in the meantime, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on -- as would be true in all cases, on speculated-about executive orders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand the White House argument on this one, because you say regularly that you prefer that Congress act and pass the law.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been talking up his use of executive action for several months, and he\xe2\x80\x99s taken several executive actions on issues that he\xe2\x80\x99s still pressing Congress to do more broadly.\xc2\xa0 He did it with the minimum wage a couple of months ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s still pressing Congress on that front.\xc2\xa0 He just did it this week on fair pay and he\xe2\x80\x99s still pressing Congress to do a broader fair pay law.\xc2\xa0 And he did it a couple of years ago with the DREAM Act provisions and --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would say about that.\xc2\xa0 In all of those cases, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we said that prior to the issue of an executive order that we would never do an executive order.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate about potential executive orders.\xc2\xa0 What we know concretely is that Congress has taken up legislation that this President strongly supports that would ensure the rights of millions and millions of Americans and that is I think clearly the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So we urged the House to take action.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the option on the table to consider executive action?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not consistent with the argument that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you make so many times.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just made a great point, which is that in the prior -- (laughter) -- in the examples that you said, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like we were talking about what actions we might take in the future.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to suggest anything by that, except to say that there is legislation in Congress that we strongly support and we urge the House to pass.\xc2\xa0 And I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to discussions about or speculation about executive orders in this arena or anywhere else.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling it out?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add.\xc2\xa0 So in the realm of speculation, I don\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of rules.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Did I promise anybody --</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ah, week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Zeke, I see you back there kind of hidden.\xc2\xa0 So you ask a question while I pull out my --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just trying to take a stab at Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question earlier about the U.N.-U.S. treaty over -- the headquarters agreement.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how this decision can be made while still fitting within that legal agreement that says that the United States shall expeditiously approve these applications for --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we take our host country responsibilities very seriously, Zeke, which is why this is such a rare case.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer, so I\xe2\x80\x99d send you to lawyers maybe at the U.N. mission.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we have made it clear and communicated it that we will not issue a visa to Mr. Abutalebi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And State had said previously that there is a loophole here for issues of security, terrorism and foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Which of those three does this case fall under?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to experts on such things -- and I am not that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will host an Easter Prayer Breakfast here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Tuesday, the President and the First Lady will mark the beginning of Passover with a Seder at the White House with friends and staff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Wednesday, the President and Vice President will travel to Leetsdale, Pennsylvania for an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Further details on the President and Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Pennsylvania will be made available in the coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re both going together?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They will both travel to Leetsdale, Pennsylvania.\xc2\xa0 More details on that travel will be made available in the coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Thursday, the President will welcome the Wounded Warrior Project Soldier Ride to the White House in celebration of the 8th annual soldier ride, a cycling event to help wounded warriors restore their physical and emotional wellbeing.\xc2\xa0 The soldier ride also raises awareness of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s wounded warriors who battle the physical and psychological damages of war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">On Friday, the President will meet with the National Commander and Executive Director of the American Legion.\xc2\xa0 Later, he will welcome the United States Naval Academy football team to the White House to present them with the 2013 Commander-in-Chief\xe2\x80\x99s trophy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you next week.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in town for Easter?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not traveling?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all the travel I have for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n1:26 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
