CST</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Buenas tardes.\xc2\xa0 President Castro, to you, the Cuban government and the Cuban people, thank you for the welcome that you have extended to me, to my family, and to my delegation.\xc2\xa0 For more than half a century, the sight of a U.S. President here in Havana would have been unimaginable.\xc2\xa0 But this is a new day -- es un nuevo d\xc3\xada -- between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith your indulgence, Mr. President, I want to go just briefly off topic because during this weekend, I received news that one of our outstanding United States Armed Service members, Marine Staff Sergeant Louis F. Cardin of Temecula, California, was killed in northern Iraq as we assisted the Iraqi government in dealing with ISIL, the terrorist organization there.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to give my thoughts and prayers to the family there and those who have been injured.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a reminder that even as we embark on this historic visit, there are U.S. Armed Service members who are sacrificing each and every day on behalf of our freedom and our safety.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy wife, Michelle, and I brought our daughters -- and by the way, they don\'t always want to go with us; they\xe2\x80\x99re teenagers now.\xc2\xa0 They have friends at home and they have things to do -- but they wanted to come to Cuba because they understood, and we wanted to show them, the beauty of Cuba and its people.\xc2\xa0 We were moved by the Cubans who received us yesterday, smiling and waving, as we drove in from the airport.\xc2\xa0 We were grateful for the opportunity to experience Old Havana -- had some excellent Cuban food.\xc2\xa0 Our visit to the Cathedral was a reminder of the values that we share, of the deep faith that sustains so many Cubans and Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it also gave me an opportunity to express my gratitude to Cardinal Ortega, who, along with His Holiness Pope Francis, did so much to support the improved relations between our governments.\xc2\xa0 This morning, I was honored to pay tribute to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mart\xc3\xad -- not only his role in Cuban independence, but the profound words that he wrote and spoke in support of liberty and freedom everywhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tI bring with me the greetings and the friendship of the American people.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m joined on this trip by nearly 40 members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 This is the largest such delegation of my presidency, and it indicates the excitement and interest in America about the process that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken.\xc2\xa0 These members of Congress recognize that our new relationship with the Cuban people is in the interest of both nations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m also joined by some of America\xe2\x80\x99s top business leaders and entrepreneurs because we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to pursue more commercial ties, which create jobs and opportunity for Cubans and Americans alike.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m especially pleased that I\xe2\x80\x99m joined on this trip by so many Cuban Americans.\xc2\xa0 For them, and for the more than two million proud Cuban Americans across the United States, this is a moment filled with great emotion.\xc2\xa0 Ever since we made it easier to travel between our countries, more Cuban Americans are coming home.\xc2\xa0 For many, this is a time of new hope for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, President Castro, I want to thank you for the courtesy and the spirit of openness that you\xe2\x80\x99ve shown during our talks.\xc2\xa0 At our meeting in Panama last year, you said that we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to discuss every issue, and everything is on the table.\xc2\xa0 So with your understanding, my statement will be a little longer than usual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Castro always jokes with me about how long Castro brothers\xe2\x80\x99 speeches can be.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m going to actually go a little longer than you probably today, with your indulgence.\xc2\xa0 We have a half a century of work to catch up on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur growing engagement with Cuba is guided by one overarching goal -- advancing the mutual interests of our two countries, including improving the lives of our people, both Cubans and Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said consistently, after more than five very difficult decades, the relationship between our governments will not be transformed overnight.\xc2\xa0 We continue, as President Castro indicated, to have some very serious differences, including on democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 And President Castro and I have had very frank and candid conversations on these subjects.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States recognizes progress that Cuba has made as a nation, its enormous achievements in education and in health care.\xc2\xa0 And perhaps most importantly, I affirmed that Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation.\xc2\xa0 Cuba is sovereign and, rightly, has great pride.\xc2\xa0 And the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans, not by anybody else.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, as we do wherever we go around the world, I made it clear that the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of democracy, including the right of the Cuban people to decide their own future.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll speak out on behalf of universal human rights, including freedom of speech, and assembly, and religion.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, I look forward to meeting with and hearing from Cuban civil society leaders tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as you heard, President Castro has also addressed what he views as shortcomings in the United States around basic needs for people, and poverty and inequality and race relations.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome that constructive dialogue as well -- because we believe that when we share our deepest beliefs and ideas with an attitude of mutual respect, that we can both learn and make the lives of our people better.</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of normalizing relations means that we discuss our differences directly.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to hold our next U.S.-Cuba human rights dialogue here in Havana later this year.\xc2\xa0 And both of our countries will welcome visits by independent United Nations experts as we combat human trafficking, which we agree is a profound violation of human rights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEven as we discuss these differences, we share a belief that we can continue to make progress in those areas that we have in common.\xc2\xa0 President Castro, you said in Panama that \xe2\x80\x9cwe might disagree on something today on which we would agree tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been the case over the past 15 months and the days leading up to this visit.\xc2\xa0 And today, I can report that we continue to move forward on many fronts when it comes to normalizing relations.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with more opportunities for Americans to travel to Cuba and interact with the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 Over the past year, the number of Americans coming here has surged.\xc2\xa0 Last week, we gave approval for individual Americans to come here for educational travel.\xc2\xa0 U.S. airlines will begin direct commercial flights this year.\xc2\xa0 With last week\xe2\x80\x99s port security announcement, we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed the last major hurdle to resuming cruises and ferry service.\xc2\xa0 All of which will mean even more Americans visiting Cuba in the years ahead and appreciating the incredible history and culture of the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with more trade.\xc2\xa0 With only 90 miles between us, we\xe2\x80\x99re natural trading partners.\xc2\xa0 Other steps we took last week -- allowing the U.S. dollar to be used more widely with Cuba, giving Cubans more access to the dollar in international transactions, and allowing Cubans in the U.S. to earn salaries \xe2\x80\x93- these things will do more to create opportunities for trade and joint ventures.\xc2\xa0 We welcome Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s important announcement that it plans to end the 10 percent penalty on dollar conversions here, which will open the door to more travel and more commerce.\xc2\xa0 And these steps show that we\xe2\x80\x99re opening up to one another.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith this visit, we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to deepen our cooperation on agriculture to support our farmers and our ranchers.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll highlight some of the new commercial deals being announced by major U.S. companies.\xc2\xa0 And just as I continue to call on Congress to lift the trade embargo, I discussed with President Castro the steps we urge Cuba to take to show that it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to do more business, which includes allowing more joint ventures and allowing foreign companies to hire Cubans directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with our efforts to help connect more Cubans to the Internet and the global economy.\xc2\xa0 Under President Castro, Cuba has set a goal of bringing Cubans online.\xc2\xa0 And we want to help.\xc2\xa0 At this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s entrepreneurship event, I\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss additional steps we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to help more Cubans learn, innovate, and do business online -- because in the 21st century, countries cannot be successful unless their citizens have access to the Internet.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with more educational exchanges.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the generous support of the Cuban-American community, I can announce that my 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative will offer new opportunities for university students to study abroad -- more Americans at Cuban schools and more Cubans at U.S. schools.\xc2\xa0 And going forward, educational grants and scholarships will be available to Cuban students.\xc2\xa0 And in partnership with the Cuban government, we\xe2\x80\x99ll offer more English language training for Cuban teachers, both in Cuba and online.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven as Cubans prepare for the arrival of the Rolling Stones, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with more events and exchanges that bring Cubans and Americans together as well.\xc2\xa0 We all look forward to tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s matchup between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National Team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving ahead with partnerships in health, science, and the environment.\xc2\xa0 Just as Cubans and American medical teams have worked together in Haiti against cholera, and in West Africa against Ebola -- and I want to give a special commendation to Cuban doctors who volunteered and took on some very tough assignments to save lives in West Africa in partnership with us and other nations.\xc2\xa0 We very much appreciate the work that they did.\xc2\xa0 Our medical professionals will now collaborate in new areas, preventing the spread of viruses like Zika and leading new research into cancer vaccines.\xc2\xa0 Our governments will also work to protect the beautiful waters of this region that we share.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as two countries threatened by climate change, I believe we can work together to protect communities and our low-lying coasts.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re inviting Cuba to join us and our Caribbean and Central American partners at this spring\xe2\x80\x99s regional energy summit in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, we\'re moving ahead with our closer cooperation on regional security.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working to deepen our law enforcement coordination, especially against narco-traffickers that threaten both of our peoples.\xc2\xa0 I want to thank President Castro and the Cuban government for hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC.\xc2\xa0 And we remain optimistic that Colombians can achieve a lasting and just peace.\xc2\xa0 And although we did not have an extensive discussion of Venezuela, we did touch on the subject.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that the whole region has an interest in a country that is addressing its economic challenges, is responsive to the aspirations of its people, and is a source of stability in the region.\xc2\xa0 That is, I believe, an interest that we should all share.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, President Castro, I want to thank you for welcoming me.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the United States and Cuba are now engaged across more areas than any time during my lifetime.\xc2\xa0 With every passing day, more Americans are coming to Cuba, more U.S. businesses and schools and faith groups are working to forge new partnerships with the Cuban people.\xc2\xa0 More Cubans are benefitting from the opportunities that this travel and trade bring.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you indicated, the road ahead will not be easy.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to swim with sharks in order to achieve the goals that you and I have set forth.\xc2\xa0 As you say here in Cuba, \xe2\x80\x9cechar para adelante.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Despite the difficulties, we will continue to move forward.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely confident that if we stay on this course, we can deliver a better and brighter future for both the Cuban people and the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Muchas gracias.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst question, Jim Acosta.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you, President Castro, for your hospitality in Havana.\xc2\xa0 And thank you, Mr. President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (In English.)\xc2\xa0 In your meeting with President Castro, what words did you use to urge him to pursue democratic reforms and expand human rights here in Cuba?\xc2\xa0 Will you invite President Castro to the White House?\xc2\xa0 We know he\xe2\x80\x99s been to New York.\xc2\xa0 And why did you not meet with Fidel Castro?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, President Castro, my father is Cuban.\xc2\xa0 He left for the United States when he was young.\xc2\xa0 Do you see a new and democratic direction for your country?\xc2\xa0 And why you have Cuban political prisoners?\xc2\xa0 And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you release them?\xc2\xa0 And one more question, who do you prefer -- Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think we both indicated, we had a very fruitful conversation around issues of democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 Our starting point is that we have two different systems -- two different systems of government, two different economies.\xc2\xa0 And we have decades of profound differences, both bilaterally and internationally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I have said to President Castro is that we are moving forward and not looking backwards; that we don\xe2\x80\x99t view Cuba as a threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0 I hope that my visit here indicates the degree to which we\'re setting a new chapter in Cuban-American relations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as is true with countries around the world where we have normalized relations, we will continue to stand up for basic principles that we believe in.\xc2\xa0 America believes in democracy.\xc2\xa0 We believe that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are not just American values, but are universal values.\xc2\xa0 They may not express themselves exactly in the same way in every country, they may not be enshrined in the founding documents or constitutions of every country the same way, or protected legally in exactly the same ways, but the impulse -- the human impulse towards freedom, the freedom that Jos\xc3\xa9 Mart\xc3\xad talked about, we think is a universal longing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Castro I think has pointed out that, in his view, making sure that everybody is getting a decent education or health care, has basic security in old age -- that those things are human rights, as well.\xc2\xa0 I personally would not disagree with him.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t detract from some of these other concerns.\xc2\xa0 And the goal of the human rights dialogue is not for the United States to dictate to Cuba how they should govern themselves, but to make sure that we are having a frank and candid conversation around this issue and hopefully that we can learn from each other.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does not mean that it has to be the only issue we talk about.\xc2\xa0 Economics, health, scientific exchanges, international cooperation on issues of regional as well as global import are also important.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that we are going to stay on.\xc2\xa0 And I actually welcome President Castro commenting on some of the areas where he feels that we\'re falling short because I think we should not be immune or afraid of criticism or discussion, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing I do know is that when I talk to Cuban Americans -- and, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99re second generation, and so I think I speak not for you directly, but for many that I talk to around the United States -- I think there is enormous hope that there can be reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 And the bridge that President Castro discussed can be built between the Cuban American community and Cubans here.\xc2\xa0 There are family ties and cultural ties that are so strong.\xc2\xa0 And I think everyone would benefit from those ties being reestablished.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the impediments to strengthening those ties is these disagreements around human rights and democracy.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that we can have a good conversation about that and to actually make progress, that, I think, will allow us to see the full flowering of a relationship that is possible.\xc2\xa0 In the absence of that, I think it will continue to be a very powerful irritant.\xc2\xa0 And this is not unique to U.S.-Cuban relations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that, as you know, I have conversations with when we go to bilateral meetings with some of our very close allies, as well as countries that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have as close of a relationship to.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is something that matters.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve met with people who have been subject to arbitrary detention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that I generally have to speak out on because I hear from them directly and I know what it means for them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 I was asking if his question was directed to me or to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 You talked about political prisoners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 I think the second one was addressed to you.\xc2\xa0 Trump and Hillary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 For him or for me?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 For you, Mr. President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 What did you say about the political prisoners?\xc2\xa0 Can you repeat that question about political prisoners?\xc2\xa0 Did you ask if we had political prisoners?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to know if you have Cuban political prisoners and why you don\xe2\x80\x99t release them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 Give me the list of political prisoners and I will release them immediately.\xc2\xa0 Just mention a list.\xc2\xa0 What political prisoners?\xc2\xa0 Give me a name or names.\xc2\xa0 After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners.\xc2\xa0 And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, President Castro?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 Well, I cannot vote in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 My question is for President Raul Castro.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m from Cuban TV.\xc2\xa0 President Raul Castro, you have repeatedly stated, and today once again, that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences.\xc2\xa0 Could you broaden this concept?\xc2\xa0 This is a historical moment that we are living.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then I have a brief question for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 President Obama, could U.S. government give more space to eliminate U.S. blockade during your mandate so that another generation of Cubans would not have to suffer this economic and commercial blockade against Cuba?</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 The first question was for me.\xc2\xa0 Please repeat your question, because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 You have said repeatedly that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences.</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 Well, President Obama himself has referred to that.\xc2\xa0 We have given the first steps \xe2\x80\x93- many for being the first steps.\xc2\xa0 And we must continue giving these steps.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we will be able to coexist peacefully in an environment of mutual cooperation as we are doing already in many fields for the benefit of both countries and with the benefit of other countries as we have already done -- in Haiti, with the cholera and in Africa with the Ebola.\xc2\xa0 That is the future of mankind if we want to save the humans species.\xc2\xa0 The level of water grows and the island may become smaller.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou are asking too many questions to me.\xc2\xa0 I think questions should be directed to President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 So we have administratively already made a number of modifications on the embargo.\xc2\xa0 I referred to a number of them in my opening statement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been fairly aggressive in exercising as much flexibility as we can, given that the law putting the embargo in place has not been repealed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 There may be some technical aspects of the embargo that we can still make adjustments on, depending on problems as they arise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, for example, the issue around the dollar and the need to make modifications in terms of how the embargo was implemented to encourage, rather than discourage reforms that the Cuban government itself is willing to engage in and to facilitate greater trade and commerce, that is something that grew out of the dialogue between our governments, and we have made appropriate adjustments to it.\xc2\xa0 It will take some time for commercial banks to understand the new rules, but we actually think that this is an area where we can improve current circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you that the list of things that we can do administratively is growing shorter, and the bulk of changes that have to be made with respect to the embargo are now going to rely on Congress making changes.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about the interests in getting that done before I leave.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, Congress is not as productive as I would like during a presidential election year.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that we have such a large congressional delegation with Democrats and Republicans with us is an indication that there is growing interest inside of Congress for lifting the embargo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I just indicated in my earlier answer, how quickly that happens will, in part, depend on whether we can bridge some of our differences around human rights issues.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the dialogue I think is so important.\xc2\xa0 It sends a signal that at least there\xe2\x80\x99s engagement between the two countries on these matters.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I promised the President I would take one more question.\xc2\xa0 Andrea Mitchell of NBC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel, after your meeting today, that you have made enough progress to even accelerate the pace and that the Cuban government is able to move quickly enough so that the changes that you have made through these technical adjustments to the embargo will be permanent, cannot be reversed by the next President?\xc2\xa0 And what advice have you given to President Castro about the ability of having the blockade, the embargo lifted?\xc2\xa0 Because he has said again today this is a continuous issue which is blocking progress, from their standpoint.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said the conversations about human rights were frank and candid and that you want to move forward.\xc2\xa0 But even as you were arriving, there were dramatic arrests of peaceful protests -- the Ladies in White.\xc2\xa0 What signal does that send?\xc2\xa0 Can you have civilized coexistence at the same time you have such profound disagreements about the very definitions of what human rights means, as President Castro expressed today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for President Castro, for many of us, it\'s remarkable to hear you speak about all these subjects.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what you see in the future?\xc2\xa0 President Obama has nine months remaining.\xc2\xa0 You have said you would be stepping down in 2018.\xc2\xa0 What is the future of our two countries, given the different definitions and the different interpretations of profound issues like democracy and human rights?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, Andrea, the embargo is going to end.\xc2\xa0 When, I can\'t be entirely sure, but I believe it will end.\xc2\xa0 And the path that we\'re on will continue beyond my administration.\xc2\xa0 The reason is logic.\xc2\xa0 The reason is that what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people. And as I said when we made the announcement about normalization of relations, if you keep on doing something over and over again for 50 years and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, it might make sense to try something new.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that there has been strong support not just inside of Congress, not just among the American people, but also among the Cuban people indicates that this is a process that should and will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having said that, lifting the embargo requires the votes of a majority in Congress, and maybe even more than a majority in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And as I indicated to President Castro, two things I think will help accelerate the pace of bringing the embargo to an end.\xc2\xa0 The first is to the degree that we can take advantage of the existing changes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made and we see progress, that will help to validate this change in policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, for example, we have said that it is no longer a restriction on U.S. companies to invest in helping to build Internet and broadband infrastructure inside of Cuba.\xc2\xa0 It is not against U.S. law, as it\'s been interpreted by the administration.\xc2\xa0 If we start seeing those kinds of commercial deals taking place and Cubans are benefitting from greater access to the Internet -- and when I go to the entrepreneurship meeting later this afternoon, I understand that we\'re going to meet some young Cubans who are already getting trained and are facile in using the Internet, they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in startups -- that builds a constituency for ending the embargo.\xc2\xa0 If we build on the work that we\'re doing in agriculture, and you start seeing more U.S. farmers interacting with Cuban farmers, and there\xe2\x80\x99s more exports and imports -- that builds a constituency and the possibility of ending the embargo increases.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully taking advantage of what we\'ve already done will help.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second area, which we\'ve already discussed extensively, is the issue of human rights.\xc2\xa0 People are still concerned about that inside of Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, keep in mind I\xe2\x80\x99ve got fierce disagreements with the Chinese around human rights.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to Vietnam later this year -- I have deep disagreements with them as well. \xc2\xa0When we first visited Burma, people questioned whether we should be traveling there because of longstanding human rights violations in our view.\xc2\xa0 And the approach that I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken has been that if I engage frankly, clearly, stating what our beliefs are but also being clear that we can\'t force change on any particular country -- ultimately it has to come from within -- then that is going to be a more useful strategy than the same kinds of rigid disengagement that for 50 years did nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess ultimately what this comes down to, Andrea, is I have faith in people.\xc2\xa0 I think that if you meet Cubans here and Cubans meet Americans, and they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting and talking and interacting and doing business together, and going to school together and learning from each other, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll recognize people are people.\xc2\xa0 And in that context, I believe that change will occur.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, now I\xe2\x80\x99m done, but Se\xc3\xb1or Presidente, I think Andrea had a question for you just about your vision.\xc2\xa0 It\'s up to you.\xc2\xa0 He did say he was only going to take one question and I was going to take two.\xc2\xa0 But I leave it up to you if you want to address that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Por favor.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Andrea, she\xe2\x80\x99s one of our most esteemed journalists in America, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99d appreciate just a short, brief answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 Andrea --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT CASTRO:\xc2\xa0 (As interpreted.)\xc2\xa0 There is a program here to be fulfilled.\xc2\xa0 I know that if I stay here, you will ask 500 questions.\xc2\xa0 I said that I was going to answer one.\xc2\xa0 Well, I answered one and a half.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has already helped me out with the answer here, Andrea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI was reading something about human rights, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make the question to you now.\xc2\xa0 There are 61 international instruments recognized. \xc2\xa0How many countries in the world comply with all the human rights and civil rights that have been included in these 61 instruments?\xc2\xa0 What country complies with them all?\xc2\xa0 Do you know how many?\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 None.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 None, whatsoever.\xc2\xa0 Some countries comply some rights; others comply others.\xc2\xa0 And we are among these countries.\xc2\xa0 Out of these 61 instruments, Cuba has complied with 47 of these human rights instruments.\xc2\xa0 There are countries that may comply with more, there\xe2\x80\x99s those that comply with less.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the human rights issue should not be politicized.\xc2\xa0 That is not correct.\xc2\xa0 That is a purpose that will stay the same way.\xc2\xa0 For example, for Cuba, the desire for all the rights.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any more sacred right than the right to health, so that billions of children don\xe2\x80\x99t die just for the lack of a vaccine or a drug or a medicament?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the right to free education for all those born anywhere in the world or in any country?\xc2\xa0 I think many countries don\'t think this is a human right.\xc2\xa0 In Cuba, all children are born in a hospital and they are registered that same day, because when mothers are in advance pregnancy they go to hospitals days before, many days before delivery, so that all children are born in hospitals.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if they live in faraway places or in mountains or hills.\xc2\xa0 We have many other rights -- a right to health, the right to education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is my last example that I will mention.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that for equal work, men get better paid than women just for the fact of being women?\xc2\xa0 Well, in Cuba, women get the same pay for same work.\xc2\xa0 I can give you many, many examples.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we can use the argument of human rights for political confrontation.\xc2\xa0 That is not fair.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it\'s not honest.\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of confrontations, of course.\xc2\xa0 But let us work so that we can all comply with all human rights.\xc2\xa0 It\'s like talking about pride -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to end here because it\'s a commitment that we should end in time.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not correct to ask me about political prisoners in general.\xc2\xa0 Please give me the name of a political prisoner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think this is enough.\xc2\xa0 We have concluded.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your participation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
