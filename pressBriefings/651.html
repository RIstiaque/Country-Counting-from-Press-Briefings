Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:46 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House today for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 And before I take your questions, let me make a bit of a statement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Patricia Millett\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to be a judge on the U.S. Court of the Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\xc2\xa0 This is an important step toward filling that court\xe2\x80\x99s three vacancies.</p>\n<p>Millett is a leading appellate lawyer, having argued before the U.S. Supreme Court 32 times.\xc2\xa0 And seven former solicitors general of both parties believe that she is \xe2\x80\x9cideally suited\xe2\x80\x9d to serve on this court.</p>\n<p>Republicans cynically opposed Millett\xe2\x80\x99s nomination today in an effort to obstruct the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibility to fill judicial vacancies.\xc2\xa0 But the D.C. Circuit has more pending appeals per active judge today than it did when any of the previous President\xe2\x80\x99s four nominees to that court were confirmed.\xc2\xa0 In fact, during the last administration, the same senators who voted against Millett\xe2\x80\x99s nomination today had no problem voting repeatedly to confirm judges to the ninth, tenth, and eleventh seats on the D.C. Circuit.\xc2\xa0 One of those seats was to a classmate of mine, Brett Kavanaugh.</p>\n<p>So Senator Sessions, for example, voted to confirm that nominee, and now says that the lack of a workload at this circuit -- in this court is a reason to oppose this nomination, when, as I demonstrated, that is a spurious argument.</p>\n<p>That is why we are confident that when the full Senate considers Millett\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications, it will confirm her without delay.\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Darlene.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 On Snowden, what is the White House reaction to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decision to grant asylum?\xc2\xa0 And is the decision by Russia some sort of a rebuke to President Obama?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Russian Federal Migration Service has confirmed publicly that they have issued Mr. Snowden temporary asylum for one year and allowed him to leave the airport.\xc2\xa0 We are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful requests in public and in private to have Mr. Snowden expelled to the United States to face the charges against him.</p>\n<p>Mr. Snowden is not a whistleblower.\xc2\xa0 He is accused of leaking classified information and has been charged with three felony counts, and he should be returned to the United States as soon as possible where he will be accorded full due process and protections.</p>\n<p>This move by the Russian government undermines a longstanding record of law enforcement cooperation -- cooperation that has recently been on the upswing since the Boston Marathon bombings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russia has said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to send him back.\xc2\xa0 So where does the effort by the administration to get him to come back to the U.S. to face prosecution, where does that go from here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will be in contact with Russian authorities, expressing our extreme disappointment in this decision, and making the case clearly that there is absolute legal justification for Mr. Snowden to be returned to the United States where he is under indictment on three charges, felony charges, for leaking classified information.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a dissident.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a whistleblower.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been charged with a crime.\xc2\xa0 He will be accorded upon return to the United States all of the rights and privileges provided to defendants in this country under our system of justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that view clear both publicly and privately in our discussions with the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure those discussions will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President now not go to Moscow in September as originally planned?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a scheduling announcement for you today.\xc2\xa0 But obviously this is not a positive development.\xc2\xa0 And we have a wide range of interests with the Russians, and we are evaluating the utility of a summit.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a deliberate attempt to embarrass the United States as Senator McCain says?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We see this as an unfortunate development, and we are extremely disappointed by it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that there is legal justification for Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s return, that he would be accorded full rights accorded to defendants in this country and protections under our system of justice.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of motivations for a decision like this, I would leave Russian authorities to describe them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the diplomatic repercussions for this move?\xc2\xa0 Are there some options that you can take other than what\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- again, I think -- Darlene asked me about Moscow.\xc2\xa0 I made clear that I don\'t have an announcement today.\xc2\xa0 We are evaluating the utility of a summit in light of this and other issues, but I have no announcement today on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, are you rethinking this reset in U.S.-Russian relations as a result of this that Hillary Clinton had begun?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our relationship with Russia, as is the case with other important countries around the world, is based in realism.\xc2\xa0 And it is a simple fact that the so-called reset in our relations with Russia produced positive benefits for American national security and for the American people.\xc2\xa0 They produced cooperation from Russia on the transit of supplies and materiel to our troops in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It provided cooperation with Russia in dealing with Iran.\xc2\xa0 It provided cooperation with Russia that led to the New START Treaty.\xc2\xa0 It provided other forms of cooperation that benefit the United States and the American people and our national security.</p>\n<p>Throughout the process of the evolution of our relations with Russia over the past four and a half years, we have had conflicts with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We have had disagreements with Russia, and we have been extremely clear about those conflicts and disagreements, most recently and seriously over Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the case and will be the case moving forward.</p>\n<p>But it is simply -- I think if those who might suggest that we should not have engaged in our efforts to -- with the Russians upon President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s taking office would then say that the benefits that were a result of that engagement were not worth it.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody would argue that that\'s the case sensibly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what do you think the Russians are up to?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, by granting Mr. Snowden temporary asylum, they must have known that this was not going to go over well here at the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I suspect they did, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they did it anyway.\xc2\xa0 So what do you think they\'re up to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was just asked that question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ascribe motives.\xc2\xa0 I think Russian officials can speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously extremely disappointed in this development.\xc2\xa0 We have a broad and important relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 It encompasses areas of cooperation and agreement, as well as areas of disagreement and conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we had long stated, as had President Putin, that we did not want this issue of Mr. Snowden to become a problem in our bilateral relationship because of its breadth and importance.\xc2\xa0 So we will obviously assess this and be in consultation with the Russian government moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, you said that Mr. Snowden is not a whistleblower.\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that the House last week had a vote on these programs and came very close to I guess delivering a blow to these programs, there have been hearings going on this week; Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has questioned the utility of these programs.\xc2\xa0 The President is having some lawmakers over at the White House today, some of whom have called into question some of these programs.\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t Mr. Snowden in some sense do the American people and people around the world a favor in disclosing these programs, given the outrage that\'s been expressed about these programs?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When you take an oath to protect the secrets of the United States, you\'re bound to protect them and there are consequences if you don\'t.\xc2\xa0 There are also procedures in place for whistleblowers that are available to those who would blow the whistle, if you will.\xc2\xa0 The unauthorized leaking of classified information has and can do enormous damage to our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And those are just the facts.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he had never come out and disclosed these programs, people wouldn\'t even know about them.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\'t be talking about these programs now.\xc2\xa0 He would still be in the United States.\xc2\xa0 But he decided to do this.\xc2\xa0 He disclosed these programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think maybe you didn\'t know -- obviously, there has been a great deal revealed because of the release of unauthorized classified information.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, as we\'ve discussed, these are programs that have been reviewed and overseen by Congress, by the courts, that contain within them protections that are designed to achieve the balance that is necessary between our security and our privacy.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that he wants that balance, supports that balance -- believes that balance has been found -- but also thinks that there ought to be a debate about these issues and discussion about these issues.\xc2\xa0 And he is engaged in that.</p>\n<p>He is meeting this afternoon, as I\'m sure you know, with members of Congress -- both Republican and Democrat, both from the Senate and the House -- on these issues at his invitation, and including members who have been very critical of the programs that we\'ve been discussing under Section 215 and 702.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is our intelligence services need to have tools available to them to help protect our national security interests, to protect us from attack.\xc2\xa0 And I think most Americans would agree with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We also design our programs in a way -- and put in safeguards and layers of oversight -- to ensure that those programs do not abuse the privacy of American citizens.\xc2\xa0 And that is the balance that the President was talking about.\xc2\xa0 That is the balance that has been a focus of the implementation of these programs.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s an ongoing discussion about these programs.\xc2\xa0 And under the administration, through -- the ODNI has undertaken an effort to declassify and release more information about them in the wake of the Snowden leaks.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that process will continue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from a terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that these programs should have been kept a secret?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re conflating a bunch of things here.\xc2\xa0 The reauthorization of the Patriot Act and FISA, these are known facts.\xc2\xa0 Congress has known about them.\xc2\xa0 The public has known about them.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that there are details about programs that are now known because of the leaks.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously believes that it\'s inappropriate to leak highly sensitive, classified information, because that can and has done and can do harm to our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 It can put people\'s lives in danger.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to the American people, is this just a legal issue that the White House is upset at Russia because it didn\'t follow extradition procedures?\xc2\xa0 Or does Snowden actually still have in his possession things that the United States government is concerned about that could be turned over to Russian intelligence?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can say about that -- well, it\'s certainly not just a legal matter.\xc2\xa0 There\'s the matter of our relations with Russia.\xc2\xa0 There\'s the matter of the release in an unauthorized fashion of classified information and the possible release of more classified information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let\'s be clear -- Mr. Snowden has been, since he left the United States, in possession of classified material in China and in Russia.\xc2\xa0 And simply the possession of that kind of highly sensitive, classified information outside of secure areas is both a huge risk and a violation.\xc2\xa0 And as we know, he has been in Russia now for many weeks.</p>\n<p>So I can\'t get into further detail about what he possesses or what kind of disclosures there may be or have been.\xc2\xa0 But there is huge risk associated with -- as anybody who works in this building and handles classified information knows -- removing that information from secure areas.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t do it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not minimizing the other issues, but is he still a danger to the United States --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the intelligence community for assessments -- damage assessments in terms of damage that\'s occurred and could occur.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not the right person to respond in detail about that.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we were in Senegal, the President told us he had not spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\xc2\xa0 He told us he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to, didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had to.\xc2\xa0 Has he placed any calls since then?\xc2\xa0 Has the Vice President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve publicly discussed the fact that he spoke with President Putin -- I forget how long ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this matter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they discussed a range of issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal level of disappointment about this turn of events?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His level of disappointment is reflected in the words I just spoke.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very disappointed, extremely disappointed in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decision to provide temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden.\xc2\xa0 And we made clear both privately and publicly that there was ample legal justification for his expulsion from Russia and return to the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a discussion we\'ve had with Russia as well as with other countries that might have been considering providing asylum to Mr. Snowden.\xc2\xa0 And those views were I think clearly stated both publicly and privately, so they weren\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\'t think there was any confusion about them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Russian government in any way let the administration know ahead of time it was going to do this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain, in addition to saying this was a slap in the face, said the administration ought to look at a wide range of possible reactions.\xc2\xa0 Among those he listed expansion of NATO to include Georgia; expansion of the Magnitsky Act -- the names under that; and more efforts to deal with dissidents in Russia being prosecuted -- he has a couple of names.\xc2\xa0 Are those things you would broadly acknowledge could be part of the menu of options before the administration in reaction to this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re still reaching out to Russian government authorities and counterparts to both get a formal confirmation of this information that has been publicly announced, and to have discussions, further discussions about the decision and what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here, and our view that Mr. Snowden should be expelled and returned to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have -- I don\'t want to speculate about -- I\'m not going to speculate about consequences or next steps even on the issue that Darlene raised.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to announce at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that this has been overseen by Congress.\xc2\xa0 Senator Wyden said on the Senate floor yesterday that it\xe2\x80\x99s his belief, based on the release of some classified documents, that there was an effort by the administration to mislead Congress about some of the email surveillance going on.\xc2\xa0 Is it the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that every time administration officials have briefed Congress they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so truthfully and that there was an effort to mislead --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim Clapper has addressed the specific issue here.\xc2\xa0 And I would --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is separate from his testimony.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that\'s separate from what some on Capitol Hill have included in the assessments that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing.\xc2\xa0 And I think Director Clapper has addressed that.</p>\n<p>On the broader issue, I can tell you that Congress has been briefed in numerous venues on these programs, including public testimony, paper briefings, and classified sessions.\xc2\xa0 And I have seen reports of 22 briefings on the 702 program and nearly as many on the 215 program.\xc2\xa0 And I think you can check with Leader Reid and Senator Chambliss and Senator Feinstein and Congressman Rogers and Congressman King, all of whom have said that all members were fully briefed on these programs.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s not many things that Democrats and Republicans agree on, but this seems to be one of them.</p>\n<p>Now, we are undertaking an effort to evaluate these programs and, as the ODNI demonstrated yesterday, provide more information where that can be done in a way that doesn\'t compromise further our security.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is these programs have been fully briefed to Congress, to members of the relevant committees as well as leadership, and in some cases broadly to all members of the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past here is that we have a situation where some of what we do to make sure that the United States is protected and that our interests are protected has to, by necessity, be secret.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s congressional oversight of these kinds of programs, and that oversight has to, by necessity, be conducted behind closed doors.\xc2\xa0 And that of course will remain the case, even as we engage in a process where, as I said about the ODNI, we\xe2\x80\x99re providing as much information publicly as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question before I let you go.\xc2\xa0 Senator Blumenthal in his press conference just before you came out said that it was his interpretation that senior White House officials were, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9cextremely enthusiastic about the concept of adding an adversarial component to the Foreign Intelligence Service Court, foreign intelligence surveillance process.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair characterization of the White House attitude about this concept that Senator Blumenthal will be here -- will not be here, but others will be talking about with the President today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize our position on different proposals that have been --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily a specific piece of legislation, but the idea.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, but rather than engage in a public --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- putting an adversarial voice in this process.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand the question, Major.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in a discussion about or characterize our views on proposals that have been put forward -- and certainly there is more than one -- except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re in conversation with members of Congress about various ideas.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that and, as the President has said, continue to take steps to improve the effectiveness of these programs, working with Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a gap between \xe2\x80\x9cextremely enthusiastic\xe2\x80\x9d and you repeatedly telling us that really the President -- the balance has been struck?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President, as he has made abundantly clear, welcomes the discussion and debate.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the balance is essential.\xc2\xa0 And I think he certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that there are ways to improve the effectiveness of the programs that we have.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham calls the release of Edward Snowden a \xe2\x80\x9cgame changer\xe2\x80\x9d in U.S.-Russian relations.\xc2\xa0 Is that going too far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said clearly that we are extremely disappointed that the Russian government would take this step despite our very clear and lawful request in public and in private that Mr. Snowden be expelled and returned to the United States.</p>\n<p>Again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in answer to previous questions, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what will become of our ongoing discussions with Russian officials about this matter or about other matters that we have on the table between us, except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very disappointed about this development.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you have not concluded that there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance now of Russia turning Snowden over to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that we reached conclusions at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be consulting with Russian authorities, Russian counterparts about this matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s talks with House Democrats, the President reportedly said the administration is considering ways to improve the circumstances of at-risk youth, particularly minority youth.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to me about some of those ways?\xc2\xa0 Can you give me any specifics?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President came out here and talked a little bit about that not that long ago, on a Friday, where he surprised the occupants of this room -- you and others -- by his appearance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add onto that, except to say that he is obviously interested in, as many are, what we can do as a country and at various levels to ensure that our children have opportunity to be educated and to join the economy in a productive way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you at least confirm that the President told Elijah Cummings he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for ways to help at-risk minority youth?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the meeting, Wendell, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a verbatim readout.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not contesting that, I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said a little bit earlier that the White House is \xe2\x80\x9cevaluating the utility of a summit.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that the White House is evaluating the G20 Summit in St. Petersburg?\xc2\xa0 Will you continue -- and perhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Russia at all?\xc2\xa0 Or are you referring exclusively to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to the bilateral summit in Moscow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So without a doubt, we will travel -- the White House will travel to St. Petersburg?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no changes in our travel plans to announce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic that\xe2\x80\x99s been heating between the U.S. and Syria -- and Russia is the topic of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We heard today from Bashar al-Assad, who left Damascus -- a first public trip.\xc2\xa0 He went off to a former rebel stronghold.\xc2\xa0 The red line has been crossed.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is now, as you guys have acknowledged, aiding the rebels directly.\xc2\xa0 But now the Syrian regime is almost claiming victory.\xc2\xa0 So has the White House\xe2\x80\x99s policy towards Syria failed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen that they declared victory, but I would take --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said -- a sure victory.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure you can take what Bashar al-Assad says to the bank, because his words have been so credible for so long.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with that immense caveat, I would say that we are working with our partners and allies and directly with the opposition to strengthen the opposition and continue to help unify the opposition as it engages with Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces and as it works to help bring about what has to be a political transition to a post-Assad Syria.</p>\n<p>On the issue of the use of chemical weapons, we have said and continue to say that all parties in Syria should facilitate the U.N. team\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to complete its mission to investigate the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 It is critical for the U.N. to be able to visit all of the sites for which it has received credible information indicating the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the U.N. must be able to talk to key witnesses, doctors and affected individuals and examine and collect any physical evidence available without any interference or manipulation from the Syrian government.</p>\n<p>And I say this because there\xe2\x80\x99s been some indication from the Syrian government about its willingness to allow for the U.N. investigation to proceed.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to my opening remarks, which is when it comes to statements by the Assad government, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain history of a lack of credibility, so that promises need to be backed up by actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is meeting today with the President of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Fifty-six of the 86 detainees at Guantanamo that have been cleared for transfer are from Yemen.\xc2\xa0 When will we learn that those transfers begin to take place, and for what do we wait, I guess?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would not anticipate any announcements today on this issue, with respect to whether, when, or under what circumstances Yemeni detainees may be repatriated.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President -- well, as I think I said yesterday, I anticipate that the President will reiterate to President Hadi his firm commitment to closing Guantanamo and his decision to lift the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen in favor of a case-by-case approach.\xc2\xa0 But the lifting of the moratorium did not mean a mass exodus.\xc2\xa0 It meant that we would then move to a case-by-case evaluation of each detainee, which is the case in the -- and has been the case in the non-Yemeni detainees.</p>\n<p>So while I\'m sure that will be a subject of discussion between the two Presidents, it will not result in any announcements today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that the biggest problem -- that the largest number is from Yemen, of those who have already been cleared, as a big-picture issue, what is the number-one issue that exists within Yemen?\xc2\xa0 And I suspect I can anticipate your answer, but articulate the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on what needs to change within Yemen for you to start to feel more comfortable sending the dozens of Yemenis back --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the lifting of the moratorium reflects a change in policy that reflects also changes in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And then when it comes to each individual detainee, there\xe2\x80\x99s a rigorous case-by-case evaluation made and that involves consultations with potential host governments, so I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s any one issue.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously, in every case, when it comes to detainees and the possible transfer of them, working with host governments to receive assurances and the like regarding what happens after the potential transfer.</p>\n<p>So, again, the moratorium was only the first stage in a process that then begins potentially a case-by-case evaluation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get follow-up on that, please, Jay?\xc2\xa0 Just about Yemen, if you don\'t mind.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So the President in May gave that speech on the current status of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\xc2\xa0 He said that he would be lifting the moratorium on detainees who are connected to Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And in that same speech he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn some of these places, such as parts of Somalia and Yemen, the state has only the most tenuous reach into the territory, and in other cases the state lacks the capacity or will to take action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I was hoping that you could square those two thoughts.\xc2\xa0 It seems to be a disconnect between lifting the moratorium and then what the President later said in that speech.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\'s why you have case-by-case evaluations and assessments made, discussions with potential host governments.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be the case as the individual detainees are evaluated after the lifting of the moratorium.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he indicated in that speech -- I realize what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying about the case by case, but he indicated in that speech that the state, Yemen, has the most -- the state only has \xe2\x80\x9cthe most tenuous reach into the territory,\xe2\x80\x9d and again, repeating what the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe state lacks the capacity or will to take action.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, you actually sort of changed your quotation a little bit in the second reading.\xc2\xa0 There are certain facts about Yemen that are true, and that\'s why in making these assessments we evaluate them carefully in case by case.</p>\n<p>And again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no announcement of a transfer here.\xc2\xa0 There was the lifting of a moratorium that made it impossible to even consider the transfer of any individual detainee.\xc2\xa0 Now at least that consideration can take place, but it will be full and rigorous as it is in every case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Yemen has full control over its territory including parts related to al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the effort to use the words that way, but that\'s not obviously what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying or what the President said.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said earlier that the U.S. didn\'t have any advance notice of this temporary asylum for Snowden.\xc2\xa0 So how did the White House find out about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think I said, the Russian Federal Migration Service confirmed publicly that they had issued Mr. Snowden temporary asylum for one year.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to every piece of the administration in terms of how they learned, but we were not certainly given any advance notice by the Russian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was through media reports --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked every individual -- every principal in the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team.\xc2\xa0 I can just -- all I do know for a fact is that there was not advance notice given.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at what level now are the contacts on this issue going to proceed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department for any contacts or conversations that might be occurring.\xc2\xa0 At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any that have occurred here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would U.S. representatives in Russia, people at the embassy, other agencies there, would they like to talk to Snowden at this point now that he\xe2\x80\x99s out of the transit area?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department for conversations with somebody who is wanted on felony charges.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Mr. Snowden be part of the agenda on the FISA meeting this afternoon?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s certainly possible it could come up.\xc2\xa0 The meeting was organized after the President saw it to invite these members of Congress last week; it was when this discussion began.\xc2\xa0 So obviously, today\'s events related to Mr. Snowden happened after that fact.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s certainly possible that this will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 I think the goal of the President\'s with regards to this discussion is to assess some of the concerns and issues around FISA that have been expressed by members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I know he looks forward to the conversation and the debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, the reactions coming in from the Hill, Republicans are saying that it shows Obama\'s weak foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that if he had a tougher foreign policy stance against Russia that the outcome would have been any different?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, counterfactuals are always hard to prove or disprove.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is, I think in answer to either Jim or Steve\'s question, when it comes to the policy the administration adopted in 2009 toward Russia, there is no question that that reset produced results that were beneficial to American national security and beneficial to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it was a very clear-eyed approach to our relations with Russia that included unsparing and vocal statements about our position when Russia and the United States disagreed on matters, whether it was missile defense or Syria or other issues.</p>\n<p>This is an issue where we obviously have not seen eye to eye.\xc2\xa0 We made very clear representations of our position when it came to the full legal rationale behind seeing Mr. Snowden expelled from Russia and returned to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We did that publicly.\xc2\xa0 We did it privately.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s impossible to engage in a game of how this might have turned out if other things hadn\'t happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we do know for a fact is that the result of the policy approach that President Obama took was enhanced cooperation in the effort to supply our troops in Afghanistan, enhanced cooperation in our effort to produce an international consensus with regards to Iran and its pursuit of nuclear weapons as well as other dividends.\xc2\xa0 So those are significant achievements on behalf of American national security.</p>\n<p>Yes, Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that within one week there has been the acquittal of Bradley Manning on the most serious charge and now the escape of Edward Snowden, does the administration need to reevaluate the way it\'s fighting the war on leakers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even sure I understand the question.\xc2\xa0 The fact is there is a legal process underway with regards to Mr. Manning.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, I\'m not going to inject myself into that as that process continues.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made clear our views about the decision by the Russian authorities to grant temporary asylum to Mr. Snowden.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are the two most high-profile cases in something that\'s been a priority for this administration relative to other administrations.\xc2\xa0 They both within a week seem to have gone south.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ari, I think that\'s a statement of opinion.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure what the question is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President decided there will be a consequence to this decision by Russia, forget what it might be?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just have no further elaboration of our views on the aftermath of this decision by Russia, except to say that we\'re certainly evaluating the utility of a summit in Moscow, a bilateral summit, and also in conversation with Russian officials.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\'t asked for anything to be drawn up, arranged proposals, options?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything to present to you here about the President\'s views on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just picking up on what you said earlier about the value of the reset and these critical issues that the United States and Russia have to discuss, if you look across the range of these, leaving Snowden out of it -- nuclear arms reduction, missile defense, trade, democratic reform in Russia, Syria -- there\'s really not a single major issue where the United States and Russia see eye to eye right now.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering what the utility is of a meeting between President Putin and President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Even apart from the Snowden dispute, what do they have to talk about that would meet your standard of a useful meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I said that we are evaluating the utility of a bilateral summit in Moscow.\xc2\xa0 And there is no question that there are a range of issues -- setting aside the disposition of Mr. Snowden -- on which we are currently in disagreement with Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have over the past four and a half years engaged with Russia in a way to try to move forward where we disagree and to move even further forward in areas where we can come to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And not included in your list has been the assistance provided in the transshipment of materiel to our forces in Afghanistan, as well as Russian cooperation in our efforts to produce a consensus with regards to Iran\'s pursuit of a nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>So, again, as I just said earlier, those are not insignificant achievements on behalf of American national security.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also true that the New START Treaty is a significant accomplishment in a relationship that is, no question, complicated and currently faced with a lot of disagreements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would answer your question by saying that\'s precisely why we\'re evaluating the utility of a summit, mindful of the approach we\'ve taken all along, which is it is our belief that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- whichever country we\'re talking about where we don\'t have purely harmonious relations, that there is a usefulness in engaging in order to see if we can move forward on areas of cooperation and to make clear directly our views where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think that comes into the evaluation of utility of that kind of meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow on Yemen?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reports in the last few days of increased -- of an uptick in drone strikes in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\'t address drone strikes in a public forum, but should we read some of this as an example of the greater counterterrorism cooperation that you alluded to yesterday that will be discussed in this meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s an interesting way of asking.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we do cooperate with Yemen in our counterterrorism efforts.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship and important cooperation given what we know about AQAP and the danger it presents to the United States and our allies, as well as to the Yemeni people and people in the region.</p>\n<p>So that cooperation is important to our national security interests, and it is something that we seek to build on with President Hadi and the Yemeni government.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on Snowden.\xc2\xa0 When was there a breakdown in communication or the relationship between the U.S. and Russia when it comes to Snowden?\xc2\xa0 Because I remember in Africa President Obama talked about how he was not going to let the Snowden matter inhibit the relationship and the working relationship, particularly, with Russia.\xc2\xa0 When did this breakdown happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would clarify by saying that the President expressed the desire that the Snowden matter not cause damage to our relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a sentiment that President Putin also expressed, and it is one that we agreed on with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s partly why we are disappointed, as I said, extremely disappointed in this decision by Russian authorities.</p>\n<p>So we had, I think as I discussed regularly, consultations with and conversations with, at a variety of levels, Russian government officials about this matter, most especially at the law enforcement level, which is where this kind of cooperation normally takes place and has taken place in the past, and making clear what our views were on the need to expel and return Mr. Snowden here to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you see this coming?\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, where was the breakdown?\xc2\xa0 When did the breakdown happen?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, April, I would just say that the Russian government made a decision today, knowing full well what our position was on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if Mr. Snowden were on a plane to the United States yesterday that returned to Russia and led to this development.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Mr. Snowden has been in Russia for quite some time and had not been returned to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So this has been a matter where we had not reached an agreement with Russia, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And then Russia made the decision it made today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another subject, what can you tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with the Attorney General -- kind of following up on Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question -- when it comes to minorities and the criminal justice system?\xc2\xa0 What is the conversation that the President and the Attorney General have been having?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t been privy to conversations like that.\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to the statements of the President on that Friday.</p>\n<p>Carrie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care implementation, the President reportedly told the senators yesterday that he was personally involved in trying to resolve that element of the health care law that prevents lawmakers and their aides from receiving the employer contribution of the health care premiums.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering if you could tell us what that personal involvement entails.\xc2\xa0 And does that mean the administration has decided that it can deal with it administratively, versus legislatively?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings, private meetings.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that Congress wrote and passed the Affordable Care Act, and the law lays out details of how people will get insurance.\xc2\xa0 And on our end, rather, we\'re focused on implementing this law as effectively and clearly as possible for all Americans who will benefit from access to the quality, affordable insurance options and unprecedented levels of insurer competition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point of contention, though, is whether you deal with it legislatively or administratively.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this is something that I would refer you to Congress on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re clearly about the business of implementing the law that Congress wrote and passed.\xc2\xa0 And the details of how Americans, including members of Congress and their staff, will receive health care are laid out in the provisions of the law, and that\'s the law we\xe2\x80\x99re working to implement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Syria, with the inspectors being allowed in to take a look at -- for possible chemical weapons, what are the administration\xe2\x80\x99s expectations from these inspections?\xc2\xa0 Do you have high expectations?\xc2\xa0 And has any additional intelligence turned up since Ben Rhodes announced that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad government had been confirmed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any further assessments to announce.\xc2\xa0 We certainly stand by those assessments that we announced previously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I said I think in answer to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question about Syria referred to the announcement of a decision to allow in U.N. inspectors to three sites, I think.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make clear is the Syrian government, the Assad government has to follow through on this commitment and allow full access; the ability for the U.N. to talk to key witnesses, doctors and affected individuals; and to examine and collect any physical evidence available without any interference or manipulation from or by the Syria government.</p>\n<p>If the Syrian government is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation, it will facilitate the U.N. team\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered access to all sites of interest to the U.N. without further delay.</p>\n<p>In other words, this cooperation cannot be conditional.\xc2\xa0 It needs to be complete.\xc2\xa0 And I think as I noted earlier, history is not littered with promises made by Assad that have come to fruition, especially in regard to this kind of thing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon-Christopher, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what attempt might the President making in terms of a unified message to Mr. Putin from the U.S. and its NATO allies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything further on that.\xc2\xa0 We obviously discuss issues like this with our allies frequently, but I have not conversations to read out to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No reactions yet from the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to ask our allies for their reactions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You have something on your BlackBerry you need to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, are you familiar with this interview that Secretary Kerry gave to Pakistan television?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Boehner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I got to go.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been given the hook.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:33 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
