EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just start, if I may, to note that October -- as anyone, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know prior to that, noticed yesterday, watching NFL games -- October marks Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, Dr. Jill Biden, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Jennifer Aniston will tour the NOVA Breast Care Center in Alexandria, Virginia, and then participate in a discussion with breast cancer patients, clinicians, survivors and family members.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later this evening, Dr. Biden will deliver brief remarks at the Washington, D.C. screening of the Lifetime movie, "Five," which explores the stories of families whose lives have been impacted by breast cancer.\xc2\xa0 Finally, this evening, both the White House and the Naval Observatory will be lit pink to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I have on that, and I\'ll go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Erica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric Cantor said today that he would give his word to the President that the House would pass portions of the jobs bill this month, but that the entire bill as a whole would not get a vote.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Erica, as we have said all along, we believe that the entire American Jobs Act ought to be considered, voted on and passed by the Congress -- both houses.\xc2\xa0 We have also been aware of the fact that some members don\'t support all measures within it, although they\'re very unclear about why.\xc2\xa0 For example, why, if you support tax cuts for individual working Americans -- 150 million Americans, for example, would be affected and have more money in their pockets because of the payroll tax cut -- do you also support -- why don\'t you, if you don\'t support tax cuts for small businesses, or money to put construction workers back to work rebuilding highways or schools, bridges, or money to put laid-off teachers back to work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So recognizing that some members of Congress, despite the overwhelming public support for every aspect of the American Jobs Act, seem not to support every measure, we acknowledge that it\'s certainly possible that portions of it, as opposed to the whole, might arrive on the President\'s desk for his signature.\xc2\xa0 And because he supports all of it, as well as the individual component parts, he would sign those portions individually, provided that they\'re paid for in an acceptable and fair way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then he would turn around and demand the rest of the bill, those provisions that haven\'t been passed by Congress, and will continue to shine a spotlight on the need to take action, the need to put people back to work and grow the economy, throughout the rest of this year, and will continue to put pressure on Congress to act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President repeated today -- or said today that Republicans should detail what aspects of the bill they don\xe2\x80\x99t like, what they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to move forward.\xc2\xa0 The House leadership released a memo September 16th in considerable detail, doing just that.\xc2\xa0 So what is it that the President needs to see additionally from them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we saw from -- again, some members of Congress, some in leadership, some of the -- loosely speaking, some of the provisions that they support, but they -- there also needs to be an explanation for why they don\xe2\x80\x99t support, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, the other provisions, including infrastructure spending, which historically has earned broad bipartisan support, or money to put teachers back to work and first responders back to work -- why not?\xc2\xa0 Especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We need to take action to grow the economy and help it create jobs right now, and these are areas that have enjoyed broad Republican and Democratic support in the past.\xc2\xa0 So if you oppose a component of this, explain why.\xc2\xa0 And explain it not just privately, but publicly to your constituents.\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident that Americans across the country -- in every state, in every district -- support the measures of the American Jobs Act. And there is no greater priority that the American people have right now than the desire to see Washington function and do things that actually help the economy instead of hurt it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, on July 7th, which was the six-month anniversary of the Gabby Giffords shooting, you said that you would have some specific announcements \xe2\x80\x9cin the near future\xe2\x80\x9d regarding gun safety measures.\xc2\xa0 That obviously hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened, so what is the holdup? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, obviously, have any announcements to make today.\xc2\xa0 I know that process is continuing, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get some more information for you after the briefing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask what the Chinese currency bill in the Senate -- whether the Obama administration -- whether you are anticipating weighing in on it, and if so, when?\xc2\xa0 And at the moment, if you could speak to anything that concerns you about the bill -- its structure or content?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said last week, we are reviewing the bill. We\xe2\x80\x99re still in the process of reviewing it.\xc2\xa0 We share the goal that it represents, which is to achieve further appreciation of China\xe2\x80\x99s currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some appreciation since last summer, which has been useful and good, but not enough.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the currency remains substantially undervalued, and that has an economic impact and we need to see continued progress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important that as we pursue that goal we do so in a way that is consistent with -- that is both effective and consistent without international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And I think that goes to the second part of your question -- we need to make sure that if we are pursuing this goal, a goal that we share with members of Congress, we need to do it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our international obligations and is effective.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that he would be sending the trade deals to Congress in the next day or so, or two.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that the administration has talked extensively about what these trade deals would mean to creating jobs, what has been the holdup?\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this administration, as you know, made sure that the trade deals that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to were balanced and fair and would both increase our trade opportunities, but do it in a way that protected American workers and made sure that our obligations, broadly speaking, were upheld.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s been part of it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, as you know, there has been a component piece here regarding TAA that has also had -- referring to things that have had broad bipartisan support in the past -- has always enjoyed bipartisan support and has it this time, too.\xc2\xa0 So there has been an issue of working with Congress, which we have done, to make sure that the whole process here takes place in a way that ensures that all four measures -- the three free trade agreements and the TAA -- are acted on.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that that will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you were watching CNN and you saw former Vice President Cheney weighing in on the effort to go after al-Awlaki last week.\xc2\xa0 He had some good things to say about the administration, but he also suggested that the President owed the Bush administration an apology for some criticism of their handling of suspected terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to get your reaction to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t owe an apology for the fact that under this administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy, this President\xe2\x80\x99s policy, the United States of America does not torture, does not engage in torture.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply a flat-out position of this President that that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply make the point that that was one of the first things this President did when he was -- when he took office, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone can dispute that this President, this administration, has been very successful in going after the sworn enemies of the United States, the terrorists who have been plotting to attack the United States, attack American citizens, and attack our allies.\xc2\xa0 And you can do both.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason to sacrifice our values when it comes to interrogation and torture -- because we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to. We can win this battle without those kinds of measures.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You asked about infrastructure, and the Republicans and what they are saying in this memo that was referenced earlier is that the administration should negotiate with Republicans on a multiyear transportation authorization bill that fixes problems such as 10 percent of the transportation funds going to things like transportation museums, and the fact that 18 percent of the highway funds provided under stimulus is still unexpended because in their view it\xe2\x80\x99s an overly complicated and bureaucratic approval process.\xc2\xa0 And so they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about fixing the transportation spending system.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President could support?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly would support the idea that we can improve and make more efficient the system by which we fund infrastructure projects.\xc2\xa0 And there is a portion of the jobs act that essentially fast-tracks money to make sure that we do move projects forward more efficiently, and other ideas that the Republicans have that were contained in that letter, which I think I might have said at the time, but if I didn\'t, there were some conciliatory aspects of that that are welcome. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely not just willing, but looking forward to, engaging with members of Congress on ways that we can improve the process and make it more efficient, and make it lead to both the kind of infrastructure building that is so essential for our long-term economic growth, but also puts construction workers back to work sooner rather than later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anyone in this building, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Bill Daley or Rob Nabors, whomever, who is dealing with the Republicans in the House and the Democrats in the Senate and others on this bill, or is it just, we sent it up and we expect them to pass it?\xc2\xa0 Is there any negotiations going on?\xc2\xa0 Is there any give-and-take along the lines of what you just were talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are always discussions between the White House, the administration and the Hill -- both houses, both parties.\xc2\xa0 And those continue.\xc2\xa0 And since this is our number-one priority, you can be sure that this is something that is discussed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a -- the two senior officials that you named are certainly involved in that process.\xc2\xa0 There is no one point person who is dealing with Republicans on the Hill on this particular measure, but there are conversations regularly about our legislative priorities, including, most importantly, the American Jobs Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess, just -- what underlying my question is I understand and I believe the President wants this bill to pass, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a political weapon in a sense.\xc2\xa0 The President is talking about, this needs to be passed, and if Republicans don\'t pass it, what are they for?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out how seriously the White House is about engaging with congressional leaders to actually get this thing passed, as opposed to talking about it on the stump.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re very serious.\xc2\xa0 But what we are not -- what we don\'t see a need to do is to negotiate away aspects of the bill that are not controversial, are broadly supported by the American public, broadly supported by Democrats and Republicans, before it has a chance to vote on the entire bill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so we look forward to the Senate taking it up, as Senator Majority Leader said it will and as the President referred to earlier today, and then we hope that Congress as a whole -- the House as well -- will begin to act on it.\xc2\xa0 If, as we discussed earlier, action is taken on component parts of the bill, as well as on the whole, then we will see what passes and what arrives on the President\'s desk.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll sign it, again\xc2\xa0 -- those aspects -- if they meet the standards of fairness and reasonableness in terms of how they\'re paid for that are very important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s no reason to -- there\'s a political side to making this about meetings and negotiations as opposed to dealing with the content of legislation that has been prepared and packaged ready to be taken up by Congress by this White House.\xc2\xa0 So we encourage Congress to take it up.\xc2\xa0 We will continue in conversations with leadership and rank-and-file members about how to proceed.\xc2\xa0 And if, in fact, we get to a point where Congress wants to break it up and send us portions of it, then we\'ll approach it and negotiate accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not going to start off by saying, well, let\'s negotiate this first piece, when, in fact, we\'ve written the legislation, it\'s self-contained, it\'s totally paid for, and every provision in it is very mainstream and reasonable.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no broad objection to anything within it.\xc2\xa0 So why not act on it in its entirety?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Norah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, so to be clear, the President wants a full up or down vote on the whole bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President announced before a joint session several weeks ago, and he has on the road talked about the urgency of the situation, why now, then, just today did he say he was going to call the leadership in Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that there\'s a -- we can go back and forth here that this is all about leadership negotiations, which I think the American people understand full well are not necessarily the way to get things done quickly and effectively in Washington, especially if there\'s not a desire on both sides to get them done in a way that\'s productive and functional for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we have been doing, what the President has been doing, is taking his message out to the American people, the people who hired their legislators and sent them to Washington to get things done.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re being very transparent about our strategy, if you will, which is to have Americans lift their voices and join the President in asking Congress, asking Washington to act on a very simple priority:\xc2\xa0 Act on the economy. Act on jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what Americans want their leaders in Washington to do.\xc2\xa0 Here is a proposal to do just that.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s a proposal that outside economists have judged very clearly would boost economic growth and would lead to greater job creation.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s act on it. Let\'s do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a matter of making phone calls in private to congressional leaders.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very clear what the elements of the package are.\xc2\xa0 And as I was saying to Jake, Congress can take it up, act, vote on it.\xc2\xa0 If, then, there is a desire to separate it out and act on component parts of it, portions of it, but not all of it at once, we would accept that, although we would not be satisfied by it.\xc2\xa0 We would not be -- that would not be sufficient. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President would make that clear; if a portion of it came up and he signed it into law, the next thing he would say is, where\'s the rest of it?\xc2\xa0 What about teachers and construction workers?\xc2\xa0 What about small businesses who could use that incentive to hire more people or increase their wages, or the incentive to hire veterans who are coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan with tremendous skills and experience but aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting jobs?\xc2\xa0 He\'ll just keep pushing and making the case.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, we are making an outside case here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President put his health care reform bill before Congress, did he just send it up there, or did he personally lobby members of Congress to get it done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think we need to revisit in great detail that period, except -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at this podium during that period.\xc2\xa0 I was working for the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 But I think everything -- every legislative approach doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the same.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not even -- I\'m not making a comparison here.\xc2\xa0 That was obviously quite a different kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 One of the beauties of the American Jobs Act is its simplicity.\xc2\xa0 It is not a complicated piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 It has very clear sections and portions, very clear what it does and who benefits and how it will help the economy, and very clear measures to pay for it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress can debate it, act on it, and we can move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the American people want.\xc2\xa0 What they don\xe2\x80\x99t want is posturing and to say, well, nobody has called me, or we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a meeting yet, so we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to do anything.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Americans at home in these states and districts are going to be like, oh, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good reason not to take action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As was referenced, the Republicans, several weeks ago, outlined areas of compromise.\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking or listening to Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just interested in appealing to the public instead?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I answered this question a couple of times already today and numerous times in the past, that the President has relations with leaders of both parties in both houses on Capitol Hill; he has conversations with them on a regular basis, and looks forward to having conversations with Senator McConnell, Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi and Leader Reid in the future on the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing both. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cynicism here -- like somehow going out to the American people and saying, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we need to do, if you agree with me, raise your voices, let your members of Congress know -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s somehow objectionable or political.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s how the system should work.\xc2\xa0 And the President is doing that.\xc2\xa0 And obviously he will work with Congress and congressional leaders as well to get these measures passed, because there is no higher priority for the people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the suspicion among Republicans is that you want to vote on the whole bill so that then you can take the component parts that Republicans vote against and use it against them politically:\xc2\xa0 This Republican voted against more jobs for teachers; this Republicans voted against more jobs for construction workers.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me be absolutely clear.\xc2\xa0 I can allay those suspicions.\xc2\xa0 To avoid anything like that, they could simply pass all of it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s the -- what is it?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been explicit here.\xc2\xa0 Yes, if Congress sends to the President less than all of the American Jobs Act, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to come out and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to come out and say, thank you, that\xe2\x80\x99s great, this is important, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to help the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to help job creation, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more to be done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I mean, and if then more gets done, well, that\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the way the system should work. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that we have differences and the President believes strongly that we should take all of the action that is embodied within the American Jobs Act, and others, perhaps Republicans on the Hill, think otherwise, then, sure, we should explain ourselves, they should explain themselves.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re being quite transparent about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the idea that you relish the idea of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 We would much rather -- much rather -- see the entire thing passed, because it would be good for the economy and good for the American people.\xc2\xa0 I promise you.\xc2\xa0 And that is 100 percent the case, both as I say it here from the podium and as it is discussed internally, in the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room and elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 That is the highest priority.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see all of it passed.\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not, we will argue that the rest of it be passed, those portions that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been passed already.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner sent the President a letter -- it said government regulations dealing with cement makers and boilers could potentially cost hundreds of thousands of jobs; said they unnecessarily increase costs for consumers and small businesses and make it harder for the economy to create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we got the letter.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to making sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have overly burdensome regulation I think has been demonstrated quite clearly in recent weeks and months, and that is a position that he continues to maintain.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, if Congress is really serious about creating jobs it would -- and creating jobs now, it would pass the American Jobs Act, in whole or in part. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the Clean Air Act and to ensuring that sensible regulations are in place to save, in the case of this particular measure, up to 6,500 deaths per year, leading to health benefits of up to $54 billion each year -- yes, when you balance your priorities as President, the health of our children, how clean our air is, how clean our water is, those are very important priorities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this President does not believe that the only way we can compete in the 21st century is to dismantle our clean air regulations or dismantle our clean water regulations -- basically, be in a race to the bottom for the worst environmental standards.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to compete.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99ve won in the past, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not how we can win in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question, Vice President Cheney specifically said the President owes former President Bush and the entire administration an apology for saying the U.S. overreacted to the 9/11 attacks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I made clear that if, specifically, he\'s saying that there\'s an apology called for because of measures that were taken that this President absolutely does not believe is the right way to go, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to apologize.\xc2\xa0 Torture was not the right way to go.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that the United States of America should torture.\xc2\xa0 And, I think as has been amply demonstrated, this administration, this President, have been able, quite effectively, to wage -- take the fight to al Qaeda, keep the pressure on al Qaeda, remove leaders of al Qaeda from the battlefield, and be very effective about it without having to resort to measures that we don\'t think are the right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we just disagree on that point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House changed its strategy in dealing with Congress in trying to pass the bill?\xc2\xa0 Because you had designated people that dealt with Congress in order to get the CR passed, Jack Lew, Vice President Biden to deal with the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 You had Nancy-Ann DeParle to deal with -- you say there\xe2\x80\x99s no point person to try to get something done on the jobs act with Congress, then that\xe2\x80\x99s a change in how the White House --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a little --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- dealt with major legislation in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing in the minutiae here of process in a way that can be interesting to a small number of people.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is this entire administration -- including people who deal more regularly with Congress, like Bill Daley, like Rob Nabors, like the Vice President -- are all focused on the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And that includes conversations with members of Congress and leaders in Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sort of discussing for a number of weeks now is this notion that we should be huddled with the -- the President should be huddled up in the Cabinet room having meetings again with the congressional leadership over this.\xc2\xa0 This is not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is asking about the President.\xc2\xa0 What people are just asking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or Rob Nabors and Bill Daley --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should they not be negotiating with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a single point person.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating a piece of legislation here.\xc2\xa0 We have a piece of legislation, and we have presented it to Congress.\xc2\xa0 It will be moved in the Senate this month, voted on, and hopefully then taken up by the House and voted on, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we end up.\xc2\xa0 But we will continue to press Congress to take action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that you\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I said that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a single person in charge --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- sounded like you\'re not negotiating a piece of legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- the debt ceiling process, as you know, was quite different and for reasons that I think everyone knows here, did not, largely, have to do with us.\xc2\xa0 There were very private discussions about trying to reach a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 And there was -- the idea was that the only way to get that done in a way that could garner bipartisan support is that a deal would have to be reached behind closed doors, and then both sides would walk out, hand in hand, and suffer some of the political slings and arrows from each side that would surely come, but the power of a grand bargain reached by the Speaker and the President would have won the day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is very different.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not negotiating a final product with Congress before we even take it to Congress.\xc2\xa0 We have sent Congress a bill that has -- that is not controversial at all but that does, by any measure -- if passed, would help the economy grow, help it create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we expect Congress to act on it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And look, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we will talk with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And as the process moves forward, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that we will have more specific conversations that I can read out to you. But believe me, we are pushing hard to get this acted on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Obama campaign put out a memo today talking about how Mitt Romney and Rick Perry are on the wrong side of public opinion, specifically when it comes to taxes on the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 Is this a reflection on the President?\xc2\xa0 If his views are the most popular in dealing with debt and deficits, then why can\xe2\x80\x99t he get Congress to take his side on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think his views -- I mean, again, depending on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a reflection on his leadership?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what we have seen this year is a situation where a minority of one party that controls one house of Congress has been essentially dictating outcomes for that party in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that makes it very hard for any President of either party who\xe2\x80\x99s in power to get things done that represent the will, the sort of grand middle here, the bipartisan will of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you make a very good point.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on deficit reduction, on long-term deficit and debt reduction is one that is shared broadly by the American people; one that includes balance, an approach that includes revenues, that ensures that no single segment of society bears a disproportionate share of the burden.\xc2\xa0 And not only is it shared by the vast majority of the American people, but by Democrats and Republicans and independents, and even a lot of Republican voices out there who happen tonot be in the House of Representatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason why we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to achieve a grand bargain, ultimately, was because that minority of that party would not go there.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, again, we have to point that out and keep pressure on Congress as a whole to take action that\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial for all of the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one thing that is going to be abundantly -- well, more and more clear I think for members of Congress is that, come 2012, every member of the House will be up for reelection, and they will have to answer the question:\xc2\xa0 In a time of economic duress, what did you do, and what did you prevent from happening? And I think a lot -- a number of members are going to have to decide whether they want to be on the side of the vast majority of the American people and the majority of the members of their district, the constituents in their district, in supporting the kind of bipartisan measures that grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you are saying this about the minority of one party in one house of Congress, you certainly had some struggles getting all of the Democrats in the United States Senate on the same page, for instance, in even agreeing to how they would pay for this, which includes some --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- tax hikes on upper-income.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t always get 100 percent of the Democrats, but 96, 97 percent is not bad, or 95 percent is not bad.\xc2\xa0 What we have is a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, even in measures independently, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve operated within their own universe in the House, where the leadership can\xe2\x80\x99t get its proposals passed because of a rebellion among their ranks that is pushing them further and further away from the mainstream. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our hope is that, again, coming out of the summer recess, perhaps going into other recesses, that these members will begin to hear more and more, not just from the loudest voices among their constituents, not the most active politically, but from average Americans out there who just want Washington to function, who just want it to get things done that are sensible and middle-of-the-road. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this President has put forward, and he believes there is a constituency there -- a majority constituency there in both houses to getting those things done, as long as the process is not dictated by a minority.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on how Rick Perry handled the name of the grounds -- the hunting grounds that his family leased?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, all I would say is that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the name is clearly offensive, and from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read -- and I have no inside knowledge beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read -- the Governor shares that opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that should reflect poorly on him as a candidate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I really don\xe2\x80\x99t know that much about it except from what I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the China currency bill, do you expect the review to be complete before the voting begins?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about it as the process moves forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that this review is with an intention to say something publicly before the vote happens?\xc2\xa0 Or is it possibly a review that just might go on beyond the time when it\xe2\x80\x99s before the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to address.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re just -- we obviously talk with members of Congress about this, we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing the bill.\xc2\xa0 Our position on the underlying challenge has been very clear, and the issues that are raised here about the need to take effective action, as well as action that is consistent with our international obligations, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you mentioned torture a moment ago, was that a reference to enhanced interrogation techniques of the previous administration?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance that -- or has a decision been made that the President will release or authorize release of the Office of Legal Counsel memo on targeting of individual Americans abroad?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say in response to that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today or ever?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today, anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what have you got on tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Mesquite?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re going out to various parts of the country and taking the message to the American people that we need to act on the American Jobs Act and the Congress needs to move, Congress needs to take its primary responsibility seriously.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the message again tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- the President has in his travels highlighted different sections of the American Jobs Act, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him do that again tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, quickly, is the President going to use tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech also to announce progress on the trade deals?\xc2\xa0 Or will we just get paper with that, and that won\xe2\x80\x99t be part of tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of a preview of his remarks than I just gave.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my second question is:\xc2\xa0 A Bloomberg story is out that reported that Koch Industries -- that\xe2\x80\x99s with a \xe2\x80\x9cK\xe2\x80\x9d -- had found ways to make improper payments to win business in Africa, India, the Middle East, and to sell petrochemical equipment in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how the White House feels about that and do you think current laws are tough enough to prevent abuses going forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment specifically on that story.\xc2\xa0 I saw it, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with anybody about it.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the issues involved there are matters that Treasury or State might have more comment on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In general, is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion about it in terms of the regulatory regime or the legal regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s -- and by coincidence, once again he\xe2\x80\x99s in the state of one of his potential rivals -- is he going to mention anything about Perry?\xc2\xa0 He has in his recent remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, beyond what we just talked about in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview for it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a big country, there are a lot of states.\xc2\xa0 You can draw connections or there can be coincidences between --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he went to Ohio because there was this infrastructure thing that he could illustrate with the bridge.\xc2\xa0 Is there something --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much -- there will be a specific aspect of the jobs act that he will highlight tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know what it is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do, but I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve put it out.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can tell us now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\'d like some clarification on some things the President said on Saturday during his speech before an LGBT audience at the Human Rights Campaign dinner.\xc2\xa0 When he was talking about the American Jobs Act, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re also folks who are worried about the economy and whether or not your partner or husband or wife will be able to find a job.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Later on, when talking about progress, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt happens when a father realizes he doesn\'t just love his daughter, but also her wife.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Should I interpret those remarks to mean the President now supports same-sex marriage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that you\xe2\x80\x99re over-interpreting the remarks, and I would just leave them to you to analyze.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on gay marriage is well known.\xc2\xa0 The comments he made late last year about his views on it are well known.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no updates for you and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read into the language there any change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t it disingenuous for the President to speak reverentially about these people\xe2\x80\x99s spouses when he doesn\'t support same-sex marriage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'ll let the President address that question.\xc2\xa0 And I think this President\xe2\x80\x99s record on LGBT issues, his commitment to the rights of all Americans, was evident on Saturday night, both in his remarks and the response he got from the audience there.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re approaching the one-year anniversary of when the President first said that he could evolve on same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 He said that late in October of 2010, in an interview with progressive bloggers.\xc2\xa0 Is that evolution -- has that evolution been shelved, or is that still on the table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I just answered that question, that I don\'t have an update for you on his position.\xc2\xa0 The remarks he made last year stand, and I just don\'t have anything new to add to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will this evolution come to an end?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have anything new to add to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jack.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, for all the talk here and by the President of the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 need to "pass that bill" on the jobs act, one way you could ratchet up pressure greatly on the House would be if the Senate -- Democratic-controlled Senate passed the bill.\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing to make that happen?\xc2\xa0 Is he personally engaging Senate Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Is he reaching out to some Senate Republicans?\xc2\xa0 What?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does have conversations with Senate Democratic leaders, as well as rank-and-file members.\xc2\xa0 He does have conversations with members of the other party in the Senate, as he always has.\xc2\xa0 To answer your question, he\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in the process of moving it forward, as are senior members of his team. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate Majority Leader has made clear that the Senate will take up that measure.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that, unfortunately, because of the way the Senate has functioned, especially of late, it requires 60 votes to move anything now in the Senate, which is far more than a majority and far more, obviously, than there are Democrats in the Senate -- which is why we hope that Republicans in the Senate will recognize and see within the American Jobs Act provisions that they have supported for many years now, and they will, therefore, see it as the right thing to do -- to vote yes -- so that we can grow the economy and put Americans back to work, and that that happy outcome would then encourage the House to follow suit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are they telling you in terms of the prospects?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to come up in a single bill, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we hope that and anticipate that it will come up in a single bill and we hope that it will pass.\xc2\xa0 The hurdles to passage in the Senate are well known, but we do hope the Senate will take it up in whole. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if, again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed already, if we get to a situation where portions of it are sent -- as the President said early on, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not going to veto a measure that he supports simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of an overall package that he sent up.\xc2\xa0 As long as the pay-for is consistent with his principles, he\xe2\x80\x99ll sign it and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll ask for the rest.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll say, okay, well this is good but it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.\xc2\xa0 And the American people don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s enough, and what is it that you don\'t support about putting teachers back to work?\xc2\xa0 What is it that you don\'t like about rebuilding highways, or bridges, or renovating schools?\xc2\xa0 What is it you don\'t like about giving a tax incentive to small businesses -- or businesses anywhere -- to hire veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the case we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Wendell\'s question, it would be ideal if the whole thing passed both houses in its entirety and we could sign it into law, the President could, and it could have its effect on the economy right away.\xc2\xa0 Short of that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the pressure up for Congress to act on all of it broken into pieces, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what comes to pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it somewhat misleading for the President to be going to these audiences repeatedly, and getting them to -- "fired up and ready to go" -- chanting \xe2\x80\x9cpass that bill,\xe2\x80\x9d when he knows himself that in the chamber that his party controls they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that there were some urgent matters the Senate had to take up that had to be acted on before the end of the fiscal year that overwhelmingly had to do with ensuring that either people weren\xe2\x80\x99t thrown out of work or, in the case of disaster aid, that Americans who had suffered greatly because of natural disasters were getting the assistance that they needed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the Senate will act.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the whole Congress will act accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no, it is not disingenuous.\xc2\xa0 And to sit here and say, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be really hard and a lot of armchair analysts say it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible, and even some members of Congress say it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen, well, I would simply say tell that to the St. Louis Cardinals or the Tampa Bay Rays.\xc2\xa0 You cannot sit there and accept that hard things are too hard to even try. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American people want action on the economy and jobs.\xc2\xa0 They do not want political posturing.\xc2\xa0 They do not want a jobs agenda that means -- that has nothing -- that says nothing to them; that says, you know what we need to do, we just need to deregulate the industries that, in some cases, helped create the mess that we\xe2\x80\x99re in; we need to give more taxes to the most affluent Americans who, even during hard times, have seen their income grow significantly as the middle class has stagnated and suffered, and do nothing to grow the economy and create jobs now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s an agenda that the American people support, and the more that we highlight that fact, and we highlight the fact that we have a positive agenda that the American people do support, we might actually get some action out of Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 This is actually a little bit related to a previous question, but Archbishop of New York Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, recently wrote a letter on September 20th to the President in which he said that for the administration and the Justice Department to equate support for DOMA with unconstitutional discrimination would -- quoting from the letter -- \xe2\x80\x9cprecipitate a national conflict between church and state.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President support fully the DOJ and HHS policies that some Catholic leaders have some issues with?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what policies -- I mean, he supports the policies of his administration.\xc2\xa0 He supports the policies -- the position that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken on not defending DOMA. So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In this particular case, the archbishop was referring to the case -- brief that the DOJ filed in the Golinski/OPM case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of that.\xc2\xa0 You might want to go to Justice.\xc2\xa0 But he does support the policies of his administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in this case, the Justice Department said that it would -- the policy, the DOMA law, was actually discriminatory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I hesitate to -- since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t reviewed it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, another question on rules of sanctity.\xc2\xa0 Given the discussion about the primaries, does this White House, as a principle, whether the days between Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve should be free of this political maneuvering because they are a nation which calls itself a Christian nation -- should this time between Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, it should be free of caucuses, primaries and so on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not thought about that, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have an opinion on it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about scheduling of primaries and caucuses for the -- we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously pleased that the President will not have to worry about primary contests in this cycle.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a position to enunciate on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way in the back, white shirt, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Have the "Occupy Wall Street" protests reached a level of the President\xe2\x80\x99s engaged awareness?\xc2\xa0 Is he sympathizing with the protestors?\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned about the protests at all? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed it with him.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it because he follows the news.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that, to the extent that people are frustrated with the economic situation, we understand.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re so urgently trying to focus Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the need to take action on the economy and job creation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as regards Wall Street, I mean, one of the things that this President is very proud of is the consumer protections that were put into place through legislation that Republicans are now eager to try to dismantle.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 And we think one way that we could demonstrate -- and Congress could join us in demonstrating -- a commitment to the kind of protections that are provided within that legislation is to take up the nomination and clear it of Richard Cordray to head that agency. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because these are common-sense consumer protections that would prevent the kind of abuse that credit card companies engaged in against credit card holders, that would protect against some of the actions that were taken that led to, or contributed to, the financial crisis that we saw in 2008.\xc2\xa0 These were measures that the President felt were very important, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear effort within the Congress to prevent the full implementation of legislation by holding up this nomination.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s cynical and a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the treatment of the protesters by law enforcement, though?\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned at all about the level --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed that with him, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed it that closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Today Eric Cantor is criticizing the President for saying last week in an interview that America has gotten a little soft.\xc2\xa0 Does the President stand by those comments, and if so, why?\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you read them -- it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to express outrage about a quote if you mischaracterize it or totally misrepresent it.\xc2\xa0 We see that happen a lot.\xc2\xa0 We certainly saw it happen with regards to this on some websites.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President made clear -- I mean, this is why he ran for President -- that the previous administration, and in some ways even prior to that, actions hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been taken to make sure that this economy and this country is in the strongest possible position in the 21st century -- economically, and in terms of our national security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he has acted every day since he\xe2\x80\x99s taken office to build the kind of foundations that we need to build to ensure that we are economically competitive; that we are investing in the things that we need to invest in to ensure economic growth, like education and infrastructure and innovation so that we can out-build and out-educate and out-innovate the rest of the world; and to take the kind of measures that ensure our national security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He came in with a commitment to wind down the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we talk about priorities of different administrations -- I mean, one of the simple facts of the race in 2008 and what\xe2\x80\x99s happened since is that this President promised to end the war in Iraq and to do it in a responsible way, and doing so has allowed us to focus on taking the fight to al Qaeda, for example.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been very effective, and I think others agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what he was expressing was a restatement of why he ran and why we need to take every measure we can to ensure that America remains the strongest, most powerful country around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he not opening himself up for criticism by using a term like \xe2\x80\x9csoft,\xe2\x80\x9d which implicitly seems to be criticizing this country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was talking about leaders in Washington and actions that we had taken and not taken -- that leaders in Washington had taken and not taken that prevented the United States from positioning itself as effectively as it could to win the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And he has taken measures in the two and a half years since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office to make sure that we are doing the right things, that we are building the foundation that we need to build economically, and that we are positioning ourselves in terms of our international diplomacy and national security and military and intelligence capacity to make America as strong as it can be around the globe in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 2:05 P.M.
