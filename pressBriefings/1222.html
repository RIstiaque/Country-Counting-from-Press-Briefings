EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the conclusions of the financial crisis investigatory commission?\xc2\xa0 And do you agree with the finding that the crisis was preventable and that current members of the administration were partly to blame?\xc2\xa0 Geithner, for example?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, let me say this.\xc2\xa0 I would -- I think Treasury has a statement on this.\xc2\xa0 We certainly applaud the efforts of the commission to explore the causes for the financial crisis that occurred in 2008.\xc2\xa0 Our biggest task in assuming office as it related to the financial crisis was getting our economy back on track and taking the necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that it never happened again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President put so much effort into Wall Street reform to ensure, again, that what happened leading up to and during that crisis never repeats itself.\xc2\xa0 And we are obviously focused on taking all the necessary steps to implement that legislation to ensure that that is the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One member of the commission, though, on that point said today that the financial system is \xe2\x80\x9cnot really very different\xe2\x80\x9d today from prior to passage of the Wall Street reform bill, if anything else, that they\xe2\x80\x99re more concentrated.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are a whole host of authorities, resolution authority being one of them, that is markedly different.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw in the crisis, taking AIG as an example, a fairly successful insurance company that somebody put a hedge fund on top of.\xc2\xa0 And instead of being able to break the company apart, the hedge fund caused government officials to have to put quite a bit of resources into the overall company rather than just dealing with some of the root causes of the downfall.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we now have the ability to break those things apart and deal with them very separately.\xc2\xa0 I would point out in my example that AIG\xe2\x80\x99s money has been paid back to the government as a result of some of the steps -- management steps that have been taken since the President came into office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one different topic, could you comment on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s use of social media, which seems to be increasing?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the thinking behind that?\xc2\xa0 Is Plouffe behind that?\xc2\xa0 And is that something we\xe2\x80\x99ll see continuing into the election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- look, obviously David is a big believer in social media.\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about around the State of the Union, about some of the interactive stuff around the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and the YouTube thing today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously YouTube is a reprisal of I think something we did back in 2009.\xc2\xa0 I think the President looks at something like YouTube as sort of an online town hall meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously a number of us use different types of social media like Twitter to communicate what the government is doing to the people in this country.\xc2\xa0 I think it is a -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just another way of bringing people a little closer to the decisions that get made here and why.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President, and the entire team, will continue to look for avenues and opportunities to expand the use of those entities, again, whether that be Twitter, whether that be YouTube or other aspects of social media.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions, one financial and one foreign.\xc2\xa0 The IMF today singled out the U.S., as well as Japan, as heavily indebted, advanced economies that need to lay out clear deficit reduction plans before the market sentiment turns against them.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the -- how concerned is the administration that investors will in fact lose patience with the U.S. over its deficit handling?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President demonstrated the seriousness in the issue of deficit reduction that must be taken, as you heard the President say, to win the future on Tuesday during the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 The President understands that we have to take steps to reduce the level of government spending.\xc2\xa0 He outlined very specific steps, as an opening bid of sorts in the State of the Union, to freeze non-defense discretionary spending over the course of five years, saving $400 billion and bringing non-defense discretionary spending, as a portion of our economy, to its lowest level since President Eisenhower was in this building.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we certainly understand, and the President certainly understands, that this is an issue that has to and will be addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s concern is legitimate, then?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not focused on the IMF report because I think the President believed it was legitimate several years ago.\xc2\xa0 Again, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into -- as you heard the President say, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into this -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not dealing with a $14 or $15 trillion debt because of the last two plus years.\xc2\xa0 This is a problem many years in the making and will take a concerted effort by Democrats and Republicans working together to find a solution to it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in Egypt, street protests are continuing.\xc2\xa0 Former IAEA chief ElBaradei has returned to the country and is calling for Mubarak to step down.\xc2\xa0 How would the -- does the administration see ElBaradei as a viable alternative to Mubarak?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s broaden the discussion and have a little bit of a discussion about some of the events in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost -- and I said this yesterday, but I want to reiterate it -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s an obligation by the government not to engage in violence.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an obligation by those that are protesting not to engage in violence by burning government buildings.\xc2\xa0 So, first and foremost, this is a process that should be conducted peacefully, and that is one of our primary concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into different personalities except to say that we believe that this represents an opportunity for President Mubarak and for the government of Egypt to demonstrate its willingness to listen to its own people and to devise a way to broaden the discussion and take some necessary actions on political reform.\xc2\xa0 Those are issues that the President talks with President Mubarak about every time they meet, and I doubt that there is a high-level meeting that happens between the two countries in a bilateral nature where those issues aren\xe2\x80\x99t brought up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how concerned is the administration that the unrest, the upheaval in the Middle East, is now spreading to Yemen, which is a key base for al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is important not to -- because every country is different and every country is at a different stage in its political development -- to not generalize across the platform.\xc2\xa0 So I think you heard the President talk about the people of Tunisia, and I think myself and the Secretary of State have said quite a bit on Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Again, I hate to generalize across a whole series of countries at different stages in their political development and their history.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Egypt, does the White House believe that the Egyptian government is stable?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Hosni Mubarak has the full support of the President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Dan, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a choice between the government and the people of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Egypt, we know -- and President Mubarak has for several decades been a close and important partner with our country.\xc2\xa0 And every time the President meets with President Mubarak -- and I would point you to the speech in Cairo in 2009 where the President also specifically addresses this, as well as the readout that we put out on the September meeting that the President had with President Mubarak as part of the Middle East peace process -- that we consistently have advocated for the universal rights of assembly, of free speech, of political reform.\xc2\xa0 All of those are important and we have at every turn encouraged President Mubarak to find a way to engender that political discourse in a positive way.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the YouTube and other uses of social media, in addition to this being a chance for the President to reach out and promote jobs or the economy, is this also an effort by the President to engage younger voters ahead of the 2012 election?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think this is just an opportunity to go to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a demographical slice and dice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity simply to go and, again, talk with people directly about the decisions that the President is making and that the government is making.\xc2\xa0 I think CNN hosted the YouTube debate back in 2007.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect opportunity to be able to discuss these things much like you would at a town hall, but bring people inside of that.\xc2\xa0 And at 39 and being on Twitter and Facebook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t consider myself necessarily a younger voter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well -- true.\xc2\xa0 One final question -- and I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been bugged about this quite a bit -- are we any closer to naming a successor to you?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As soon as the President and the team have announcements to make on the job of press secretary and others as part of the reorganization, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be made.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when that will be.\xc2\xa0 It could be later today, it could be tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made up his mind?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my previous answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir -- oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the new color-coded terror alert system, is the President confident that the new system will be able to communicate to Americans appropriately and effectively?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s designed to try to take some of the uncertainty and confusion out of -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this from both Democrats and Republicans agree that while there might have -- while there was some utility to this at the beginning, it has caused some confusion.\xc2\xa0 And the Secretary -- Secretary Napolitano is going to speak on this very shortly at George Washington, and I would point you to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the jobs front, the CBO projected this week that the unemployment rate at the fourth quarter of 2012 will still be 8.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 Obviously with the reelection campaign coming soon, does the President feel like the message of \xe2\x80\x9cit could have been worse\xe2\x80\x9d will resonate with voters?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you that what the President is -- the President is not focused on what -- is not focused today on what the unemployment rate will be in the fourth quarter of 2012.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s focused on what the unemployment rate is in the first quarter of 2011.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what animated his decisions in the tax agreement in December, again, a payroll tax cut which analysts have said will increase economic growth and job creation, tax incentives -- and we saw some of this yesterday in Manitowoc -- that allow companies to accelerate the expensing of investments, which we and others believe will help businesses expand and we hope hire more people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people here are flipping through to the fourth quarter.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on today and tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other -- Nelson Mandela is in the hospital.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on his condition and reached out to anyone in the family?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, to my knowledge, has not spoken with anybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports that he\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and the First Lady, their thoughts are with Nelson Mandela.\xc2\xa0 And we will try to keep up to date on his prognosis.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, Mubarak has been the leader of Egypt and the United States has worked with him for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 By not vocally supporting him but simply saying we support the people of Egypt, is that sending a message to the people who are out there protesting against him that they should just go full-bore and is that going to inflame the situation?\xc2\xa0 And is that what the President is trying to do?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s being tossed aside to a lot of people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s what I said to Dan, Chip.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- our government and this administration and I presume previous administrations aren\xe2\x80\x99t here to pick the leaders of countries over the people of those countries.\xc2\xa0 We stand for the universal rights that are enshrined in our Constitution and what led our country to be created more than two centuries ago.\xc2\xa0 We think that and believe strongly that those rights are held by those throughout the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just recently when President Hu was here, the President discussed universal rights.\xc2\xa0 We do not see this as a choice between one or the other, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it should be.\xc2\xa0 We think that -- again, he is a close and important partner.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 And every time the two meet the President talks about the steps that he believes that President Mubarak should be taking to have that fuller conversation and to make some important reforms as it relates to political freedoms, we believe -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to do this later this year -- to have free and fair elections.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the emergency law that\xe2\x80\x99s been largely in place since 1981 should be lifted, and spoke out in a statement by me that its extension was not a good thing.\xc2\xa0 It gives the government obviously extra judicial powers, which we don\xe2\x80\x99t find to be necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of these things we will continue to push and prod President Mubarak on in order, again, to create a situation peacefully -- peacefully -- and I think that needs to be underscored, both the government and the protesters -- to get into a place where a political dialogue can take place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since he has been so heavy-handed for so many years and you are saying that the most important thing here is adherence to international human rights or the international rights of the people of Egypt, would it be a good thing if he were overthrown?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into picking the leaders of Egypt and that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the government of this country does.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that what is important is we can -- President Mubarak and those that seek greater freedom of expression, greater freedom to assemble, should be able to work out a process for that happening in a peaceful way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The perception by many on the ground in Egypt is the United States is taking sides here -- not with Mubarak, but with the people out there protesting.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this for the third time.\xc2\xa0 This is not about taking sides.\xc2\xa0 This is not about choosing --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m saying the perception there is that you\xe2\x80\x99re taking sides.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try it a fourth time.\xc2\xa0 This is not about taking sides.\xc2\xa0 So I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll perceive to them that, again --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t perceive -- they perceive from you, not us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll play each of the four times in which I said it\xe2\x80\x99s not a choice that you make.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question on this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because, again, let me just -- when President Mubarak was in the Oval Office in September, these were issues that were brought up.\xc2\xa0 When the President spoke with President Mubarak around the events that were taking place in Tunisia -- again, go to the readout that we put out about that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very explicit that the President talked about the political reforms that have for quite some time needed to take place in Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a sustained and important message that we want to deliver to President Mubarak, to the government of Egypt, and we think they have an important role to play.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some analysts who believe the President is expressing that message much more forcefully now than, for example, he did during the Iran uprising; that he was a bit slow and cautious then in supporting the people out in the streets but he\xe2\x80\x99s not now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think our response has been quite similar in speaking out in support of universal rights.\xc2\xa0 The President I know spoke with you all in the Rose Garden prior to the Iranian elections.\xc2\xa0 And, again, as I said earlier, I hate to -- political conditions and development in different countries are different, and I would hate to generalize.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts are on this metropolitan area\xe2\x80\x99s response to the snowstorm last night?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Honestly, Mike, I have not talked to him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long did it take you guys to get in from the motorcade?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It took a little while to get in.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it took more than a little while.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you were -- anybody here that was in the in-town pool?\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think you could -- Jackie can appropriately report that based on the conditions on the Suitland Parkway, it was somewhat evident that we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of special treatment as it relates to that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it took a -- it was interesting, last night it seemed like everybody was on the room and this morning it seemed like nobody was on the road.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we hope -- and you see a lot of stranded cars.\xc2\xa0 I know some of -- even some of our staff coming from Andrews found the conditions to be too hard to travel through and parked their car in a parking lot and took the metro.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly hope that everybody is safe and accounted for in an arduous natural disaster of sorts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe the financial crisis commission was a good use of time and resources?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we applaud their efforts to look into what caused and -- what caused the crisis and what steps might be taken to ensure that it never happens again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President spent so much time over the course of the previous two years trying to ensure that the steps that we took in Wall Street reform ensured that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need a commission like that ever again.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on something Sunlen asked, Doug Elmendorf said that the natural and sustainable unemployment rate of 5.3 percent probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be back until 2016.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to look at what estimates folks have.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s an economic report that we have coming out.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what we saw was in many ways a perfect storm.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it with the financial sector, we saw it -- it continues -- we see the continuing effect of the downturn in the housing market.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I should have it -- I should always have it, the graph that, again, just shows the level of job loss.\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99re not quite apples to -- red apples to red apples comparisons because obviously the size of the economy is marginally different.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the job loss in the recession in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s, the recession in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s, and the recession in the earlier part of the previous decade -- 2001, 2002, 2003 -- all of those dips added together don\xe2\x80\x99t equal the amount of job loss that we saw -- more than 8 million jobs -- as a result of this calamity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 The key, though, is very much the path the President outlined in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 And that is, we have to take steps as manufacturing jobs have left or as companies find it more profitable to set up shop in some other place, to provide incentives through research and development and manufacturing and exports right here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President focused on in the State of the Union:\xc2\xa0 How do we out-educate, out-innovate and out-build countries?\xc2\xa0 How do we reform our budget and our government in order to lay that foundation so that the jobs that we need today and tomorrow are created here; that companies are expanding and doing business not just in different parts of this country but in different parts of the world as we see emerging markets take place?\xc2\xa0 And I think that will animate almost all of what the President does this year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of the State of the Union, the President was talking about green energy.\xc2\xa0 Some of the more traditional energy producers say if you want the economy to do better, maybe take some of the regulations off in terms of making it easier to drill or to gather coal until you can develop those green energies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is -- and I think is embodied in the promise that the President -- or in the proposal the President made and the promise to increase the amount of electricity produced through clean energy sources, to double from 40 to 80 percent through 2035, is not to take an either/or approach.\xc2\xa0 If drilling were just the answer, if nuclear was just the answer, if solar was just the answer, if wind was just the answer, my guess is the problem would have been figured out long ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But instead of picking this, this, this and this, you see in the standard that the President put forward is, yes, let\xe2\x80\x99s do all of that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do wind, let\xe2\x80\x99s do nuclear, let\xe2\x80\x99s do solar, let\xe2\x80\x99s do clean coal technology.\xc2\xa0 We have an energy problem because too much of our energy -- we\xe2\x80\x99re dependent for too much of our energy on other places in the world.\xc2\xa0 And the creation of the jobs around the newer forms of energy we can\xe2\x80\x99t lose out to a place like China, as you heard the President talk about yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s not pick just wind or just solar.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s pick a whole -- let\xe2\x80\x99s pick everything.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s embodied in what the President laid out on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s, quite honestly, why Democrats and Republicans can all find something to like about that.\xc2\xa0 And the question is, are we going to have the courage to take the steps to do something like that, to continue to make those investments?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last stop yesterday in Manitowoc, at Tower Tech, watching the manufacturing process of creating a wind turbine that might sit 100 meters upright and harness and create electricity, harness energy through wind, that\xe2\x80\x99s putting people to work right there -- creating the steel in some place, moving it in, manufacturing those towers, shipping those towers out, putting those towers up.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to decide whether we\xe2\x80\x99re going to import that type of technology from China or India or someplace else, or whether we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put Americans to work, back to work, creating those energy sources right here.\xc2\xa0 I think that very much embodies what the President was discussing on the State of the Union.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, would it be easier to be on the side of the protestors in Egypt if the Egyptian government weren\xe2\x80\x99t such an important ally to both us and Israel?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think, Chuck, that we very much recognize the right that those in Egypt want more freely to assemble and to speak, and to be involved in political reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a bedrock American value.\xc2\xa0 And I think the government of Egypt and the President of Egypt need to find a way to ensure that this is -- this type of dialogue and these types of reforms can happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say, though -- you say that the President has spoken to President Mubarak about this in the past, and all these words, but financially we don\xe2\x80\x99t speak that way.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is the -- in the top four of foreign aid, Egypt is.\xc2\xa0 And so, if -- why -- I mean, why not use a carrot and stick approach if we were so concerned about the democratic -- the lack of democratic reform in Egypt?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Chuck, this is just as the President talked about with China.\xc2\xa0 We have a whole host of bilateral concerns in relationships.\xc2\xa0 But that does not change our desire to see in Egypt free and fair elections, the ability to assemble, the ability to speak more freely, to be involved in a healthy democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that our policy for Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- we certainly support -- it is our policy to support the universal rights which I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken of and which you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak of.\xc2\xa0 Again, I hate generalizing across different platforms, but when you say that -- you said you know that the President brings this up, again -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to circulate some of these because I know sometimes when we put out a readout of a call or a meeting and it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the front page of the newspaper or in the first five minutes of newscasts, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that you might not immediately focus on some of the things that are in those readouts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, whether it was the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Mubarak in September, the statements around the extension of the emergency law, or even the readout that we did just recently on the call to President Mubarak about the tensions in Tunisia, these are things that are brought up on each and every one of those calls.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other issues.\xc2\xa0 One is the Republicans are trying to get rid of the matching funds, the tax check-off, to use it to basically save some money for the government.\xc2\xa0 How committed is the President in supporting this?\xc2\xa0 Would he veto any sort of bill that had this in it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me recirculate the statement of administration --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand what his position is, but is it a -- is this one of these he will veto this if it shows up in any appropriations bill?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s getting through.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think it will die in the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s getting through.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the government reorganization project and housing development that you\xe2\x80\x99re entering on, do you expect it will result in --</p>\n<p>\n\t(Cell phone rings.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was that me squeaking or was that one of you?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have your ringer on, do you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Got a new one, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Play it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I could make this question into a ring tone -- it would be very popular.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You should do that one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, next time record it.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMy question is right here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, and you just play it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect it will result in savings to government outlays -- saving government money in the end?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the hope would be to see some savings, yes.\xc2\xa0 But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s primarily most important in a reorganization like this is that we -- and I think you probably would see some savings as a result of the duplicative nature of many departments or departments and agencies and what have you, all having certain equities in the same basket of issues or ideas.\xc2\xa0 But, first and foremost, I think as the President talked about, it\xe2\x80\x99s reform for the creation of a government that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reorganized in decades and needs to be more fully tilted toward the challenges that we have now and that we face tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I think those are the President\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the debate that happens in Washington over the size of government and how much we should be spending each year -- and that obviously is a very active debate -- is this something that should be part of that, that is part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand, as the President outlined in his State of the Union, domestic discretionary spending -- if you did away with it all, you\xe2\x80\x99d still have I think what most people would consider to be a deficit number that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live with.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people think that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to balance the budget based on a reorganization.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but this is part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to that conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that it is.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think from the viewpoint of the President and the team here, it is to align -- it is more so to align the priorities of our government with a structure that is able to more efficiently and adequately address those problems.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President not going to Colombia or Panama on this upcoming trip, given that we have trade deals pending with those countries?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure how each country was picked.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President seeks to expand our alliances in a very important region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And my guess is you could spend -- there\xe2\x80\x99s reasons to go and see virtually -- or most countries down there.\xc2\xa0 We are, as we talked about in the briefing that we did around the State of the Union, hopeful that first and foremost, we can get the Korea Free Trade Agreement through Congress as soon as possible, and that the USTR and others can continue work on Panama and Colombia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when the President is ready to announce your successor, will he do it in person?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 Could be paper?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or trumpets.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or trumpets?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ring tone, maybe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ring tone?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Twitter?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be on Twitter.\xc2\xa0 But I assume it will likely be on paper.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s snow gridlock, does it raise questions that if there were an emergency and the President needed to get back to the White House or get to Andrews in a situation where there is no Marine One available, does it not raise national security concerns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I talked to some of the detail leaders when we got back to the White House.\xc2\xa0 And based on the resources that it would take in this instance to get enough equipment, manpower or what have you to fully block off that route while we were having this emergency, they did not necessarily think made sense at that time given, again, how many people were also trying to get home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat having been said, obviously if there was -- if we were coming in a weather emergency like yesterday and needed to have that happen, I have no doubt that that could easily happen because, again, it just was a matter of the resources that you move out there and then ultimately how quickly those resources you might need to get back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does it raise questions about what might happen were D.C. to be evacuated because of a national emergency?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m probably not the right person in terms of an emergency management official to render something like that, but I can see if there might be an appropriate agency to address that.<br/>\n\t[In the event that a mass evacuation of the National Capitol Region becomes necessary due to an emergency, the Washington DC Metropolitan Police, in close coordination with other federal and local law enforcement partners would activate the emergency evacuation plan which would facilitate the safe movement of evacuees from the District.]</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow morning the President is going to be speaking at the health care Families U.S.A. Health Action Conference.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of the kind of message he\xe2\x80\x99ll be delivering?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will take the opportunity to largely reiterate a lot of what was in the State of the Union, to talk about the economic challenges that we face, what we have to do.\xc2\xa0 And I expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll also reiterate what was said in the State of the Union around health care, the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in getting benefits to the American people as a result of the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And no doubt, as we talk about the fiscal impacts of decisions the government makes, what would repeal look like to the fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 And we know that the CBO says that the immediate impact is a couple hundred billion dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on corporate tax reform, when the President addressed it in the State of the Union it was in the context of the corporate tax rate in the U.S. being higher than anywhere else in the world and it really hampering businesses to compete.\xc2\xa0 Is addressing the corporate tax rate an area that Jeff Immelt and his new -- the competitiveness and jobs panel would advise the President on?\xc2\xa0 Would there be a recommendation coming from that panel on it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s the primary policy -- let me get a little bit better answer on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this would be the primary policy driver, but at the same time I think the President would certainly want to hear from members of that group and other members in business and -- economists, academia, that want to weigh in on that.\xc2\xa0 I think this is a process where the President and the team will engage stakeholders in a process that typically takes quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would GE, the global reach of that company and Jeff Immelt, is he somebody that the President would counsel on corporate tax matters?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President -- I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Immelt or a whole host of those with direct experience, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly eager to hear their opinions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about your successor, the process of picking your successor at all, about what kind of things the President has looked for in the person -- what the process has been?\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss it at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have occasion to do that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to follow up on Julianna.\xc2\xa0 When the President was deciding what to do or how to proceed on tax reform, and there had been talk for weeks that it was going to be limited to corporate tax reform, he did say in his speech -- he left open the possibility he\xe2\x80\x99d do individual as well.\xc2\xa0 Ben Bernanke, when he testified recently before the Senate, said that he thought tax reform should be done in a comprehensive way, individual and corporate together.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how it was done, of course, the last time the code was overhauled.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us a little bit what went into the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making that he\xe2\x80\x99s sort of singling out the corporate side of the tax code?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, I mean, look, I think each of these are going to be longer-term projects.\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- and that may indicate sort of a bit of a reason for the bifurcation because I think the complexity on the individual side and obviously discussions that are had as it relates to the fiscal side are going to be important and probably, again, take some time, even as we -- as we did tax reform in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9880s, or I should say, started in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s and ended in the mid-\xe2\x80\x9880s, we know that it is a process that takes quite a bit of time to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the President is eager to address corporate tax reform as we need to take the steps to make our country more competitive and create those jobs -- create jobs here rather than create those jobs overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say each of these is going to be a longer-term project, does that indicate he\xe2\x80\x99s not far along on the specifics on the corporate side, won\xe2\x80\x99t have any, perhaps, in the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jackie, I think -- and we talked a little bit about this yesterday -- I think this is -- I think the President wants to have and wants to hear from stakeholders, Democrats and Republicans, about what they want to see as part of corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the President has a take-it-or-leave-it plan and you take it or leave it.\xc2\xa0 I think the President wants to engender a discussion on the size, the scope, what all that may look at.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly eager to have that conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that the House Oversight Committee has had its first hearing, do you have any thoughts about the tone and content and what it bodes for the future in terms of oversight?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I traveled yesterday and didn\xe2\x80\x99t see a ton of the hearing.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think our posture hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed from even before Congress was sworn in.\xc2\xa0 There is an obvious and necessary role for needed oversight.\xc2\xa0 There is -- and there has to be vigilance that it does not become and get into political witch hunts where we try to dredge up or fight the battles of many, many years ago.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly -- we will certainly cooperate on ensuring oversight and efficiency.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the storm yesterday, is the President satisfied that the welfare of federal workers, the way they were released yesterday, many of them stuck in hours and hours of traffic home -- that\xe2\x80\x99s under the Executive Office of the President, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had an occasion to speak with him on this this morning.\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get some further guidance from OPM on that, which may honestly be the best place.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, you have a fairly large city that has few ways home, to be quite --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why weren\xe2\x80\x99t they given more time to get out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if OPM can address that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would the President sign a continuing resolution if it has any earmarks in it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was clear about -- I think the President was pretty clear about earmarks in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 And I also --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if it meant the government had no money to continue after --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President would tell leaders in Congress before the bill got here not to send it up here because he\xe2\x80\x99s going to send it back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell Senator Reid that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s 535 people that he told that on Tuesday, and he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to reiterate it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that -- I also think we\xe2\x80\x99re entering into a period -- I mean, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why the piece of legislation that was contemplated at the end of last year never made it, because I think the days of those types of things have passed us by.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Senator Reid doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have gotten that memo, though.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he said the President needs to back off.\xc2\xa0 He said that the earmarks are coming back because he plans on being around for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a serious area of disagreement between the President and the leader of his party on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, has the President talked to Senator Reid about that or is there --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is there going to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccome to Jesus\xe2\x80\x9d meeting or is it going to end in a veto?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who would be Jesus.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You must be getting at the end of your reign here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I just -- no, no, I mean, again, I think --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First Jesus reference. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- again, not to be flippant or funny but to go back to the original answer.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President was clear on this.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some very, very tough decisions, as the President talked about in his budget.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some decisions that cut programs that Democrats and Republicans alike would both say are important.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that because we know right now the government spends far, far more than it takes in and that that can\xe2\x80\x99t continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why or how you could ask different agencies and different places to undertake an exercise that those on Capitol Hill are unwilling to take themselves.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s animated the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to include not just an end for earmarks but a specific pledge that if they show up in that legislation he will veto it and he will send it back.\xc2\xa0 And he said that after the election in an interview with 60 Minutes and I take him at his word.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic travel schedule this year?\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling more domestically than he did in the first two years?\xc2\xa0 And also, he went to Wisconsin, an important swing state.\xc2\xa0 Might there be a special focus and concentration on swing states that are part of the 2012 map?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we picked yesterday because, again, I think you saw three fairly dynamic companies.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re adding jobs, they\xe2\x80\x99re innovating, they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting many of the challenges of tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And it was -- they were good examples.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why Manitowoc was picked.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you, several days after the Bears lost, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have so closely targeted a suburb basically of Green Bay to -- but I think that -- I do think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President travel more, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President -- I think the President always feels better when he gets out of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean out of the city, but out of -- you live and you work in the same place, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to get out, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see and talk to those that -- like yesterday -- that are innovating, that are building.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take trips to schools to see decisions that are being made at a local or a state level to better educate children.\xc2\xa0 And I think you -- for those that are in the pool, I think he goes on these tours with a genuine amount of curiosity as to why they\xe2\x80\x99re doing certain things, what they\xe2\x80\x99re building.\xc2\xa0 And I think to be able to get out and talk directly with those that are putting those projects together, they\xe2\x80\x99re fun trips.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick clarification about what you said regarding a press secretary announcement.\xc2\xa0 You said it could be either today or tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Do you mean that it will come either today or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It could.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It could.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might it come later?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s either going to be today or tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 One or the other?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Or -- what I said was -- I think the beginning of the answer was the announcement will come when the President and all his --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about before midnight Saturday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to make an odds joke and that will just get me in trouble.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the decision will be announced when all the decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question about the jobs and competitiveness council, when will the President make a decision about those members?\xc2\xa0 And a related question about -- is anything going to change about how the President interacts with that council, compared to the previous one, in terms of it doing its new mission?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for some of those appointments, but let me check and see if there is anything updated on that.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the structure of setting up PERAB and -- took some time and that probably got it off to, in terms of presidential meetings, a bit slower than the President and I think members of the PERAB would have liked.\xc2\xa0 This I think -- I do think the President will have the occasion to meet with this group on a more regular basis.\xc2\xa0 And let me find some guidance on timing of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 First, back on the press secretary.\xc2\xa0 If it could come today or tomorrow, does that -- that means a decision has been made, just not announced, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been told that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing is unrelated.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea what Governor Palin -- former -- meant when she said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s remark about --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Governor Palin\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Remark.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When she said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s comment about Sputnik in the State of the Union was a WTF moment?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you asking --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know what it means but do you know what she meant?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, we should talk (whispers.)\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s she trying to say -- a WTF --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure all the answers are on her Twitter account.\xc2\xa0 I probably --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 World trade --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you think it means world trade?\xc2\xa0 What is -- what would --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Winning the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, winning the future.\xc2\xa0 Oh, wow, that is -- you\xe2\x80\x99re hired.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to go back to Egypt for once more, for 30 years presidents have been saying to President Mubarak exactly what you say President Obama has been saying to President Mubarak with no effect.\xc2\xa0 What additional leverage does President Obama have and can you blame the Egyptian people for seeing just the presidential pro forma statement of, well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do more on human rights to be more than pro forma after 30 of this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the level that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the level of seriousness or exactly how each of those conversations transpired prior to when we got here.\xc2\xa0 I can only speak for our time here and that is this has -- as I said, this has been an important part of not just President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s dialogue with President Mubarak but, as I said, in talking to those here that are involved in senior meetings around government with -- that would interact on a bilateral basis with the government of Egypt, these are topics that we push on each and every one of those times.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what makes maybe this unique is -- and I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to the statements on this where we say this is an opportunity for President Mubarak to seize in order to address the decades-long concern and -- concern that the people of Egypt have for their lack of rights.\xc2\xa0 And I think our hope is that in a peaceful way we can all witness the government of Egypt, President Mubarak, and the people of Egypt come together in an important dialogue and a forum where these rights and these universal values can and will be addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reiterate one more time that as these discussions and as these protests happen, that first and foremost we want to caution both the government and the protesters to do so in a way that is peaceful and respects the very rights that we\xe2\x80\x99re having a discussion about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert, AfPak, did you go, any news?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did go for about three-quarters of it.\xc2\xa0 The President -- and you guys have a roster of who was there -- the President got an update on the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, both from a counterterrorism perspective as well as the security situation in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The bulk of the meeting was spent discussing our goals for Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2011, goals and objectives and how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet those.\xc2\xa0 That was the bulk of what the team went through this morning with the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think the assessment of where we are security-wise is not a lot different than when you heard the President in here during the AfPak review, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- while we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen progress, we understand that that progress is -- can be reversed if we don\xe2\x80\x99t continue to take the steps to ensure that as we clear, that we hold, that we build, and that ultimately the goal, as enumerated in Lisbon, begin to transfer those security operations back to the Afghan government, the Afghan people, and we see an increase in the training and their security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is Joe Biden right that it will be more than a token withdrawal of troops in July?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you back to, again, what the President has said repeatedly and reiterated in the State of the Union just on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:40 P.M.
