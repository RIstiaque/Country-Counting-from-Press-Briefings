b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>4:31 P.M. EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before I bring John up to answer a few of your questions, I wanted to run you all briefly through a tick-tock of some of the events of the last few hours, starting, as you know from our earlier statement, that at 10:35 p.m. last night, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism John Brennan alerted the President of the credible terrorist threat.\xc2\xa0 The President directed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Department of Homeland Security to take steps to ensure the safety and security of the American people and to determine whether these threats are a part of any additional terrorist plot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJohn provided the President with additional updates throughout the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrom 11:00 p.m. on Thursday to 12:00 a.m. on Friday, Brennan held a phone call to discuss the threat with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, FBI Director Robert Mueller, NCTC Director Mike Leiter, TSA Administration John Pistole, and officials from the Central Intelligence Agency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 1:00 a.m. on Friday, Brennan and Senior Director Nicholas Rasmussen of the national security staff held a secure video teleconference to discuss the threat with officials from across the intelligence community, including NSA, CIA, TSA, NCTC and FBI, as well as the FAA, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, Northern Command, the Coast Guard and other White House officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 5:15 a.m., Brennan held a phone call with British Deputy Secretary -- Deputy Security Advisor Ollie Robbins to receive an update on the suspicious package identified in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 Brennan and Robbins held a second call at 7:30 a.m. on the same topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 8:00 a.m., John held a secure video teleconference to discuss the threat with officials from NCTC, CIA, DOD, FBI, TSA, CBP, NSA, DHS and FAA.\xc2\xa0 At 9:15 a.m., John held a phone call to discuss the threat with President Saleh of Yemen. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 10:00 a.m., Brennan held a phone call to discuss the threat again with Director Mueller, and a third phone call with Ollie Robbins shortly afterward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt 10:15 a.m., John, National Security Advisor Tom Donilon and Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough discussed the threat with the President at the President\xe2\x80\x99s daily brief.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThese are the activities from this morning that were coordinated out of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this, as you can see from the rundown, has encompassed activities throughout the government, but agencies also were doing a lot and have been doing a lot since we were first -- first made the President aware last evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to direct some traffic while John answers some questions.\xc2\xa0 I will remind you that this is an active investigation involving sensitive intelligence, so there is a limit to what John will be able to talk about publicly here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, if you could talk about what we know beyond the fact that this was from Yemen, there are people in Yemen with AQAP who want to harm us -- if there is more that can be established to create a direct link beyond the country of origin?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think, as Robert said, this is an active and ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 We are working very closely with our partners in Yemen and United Arab Emirates, as well as in the United Kingdom and other countries, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe know that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been trying to carry out attacks against U.S. and Western interests, as well as against Yemenis.\xc2\xa0 So as we continue with this investigation, we are trying to understand who is behind it, the responsibility, and make sure that we understand the scope of the threat that we might face.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve identified these two packages right now.\xc2\xa0 They have been isolated and they have been made inert. So, therefore, what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do now is to make sure that we are able to address any other threats that might be out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow, you said you\xe2\x80\x99ve identified two.\xc2\xa0 What about reports that there are up to 15 packages out there that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for?\xc2\xa0 Is that possible?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 What we are doing is making sure that we take a close look at other packages that might also have some type of materials in them of concern.\xc2\xa0 Both of these packages that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified to date originated in Yemen, and so I think it is very prudent for us to make sure that other packages that might be coming in similar routes or from Yemen, as well, are looked at very carefully.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now.\xc2\xa0 But there are only two packages right now that have materials of concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President described this is as a credible terrorist threat against the United States.\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether this was actually an attempted terrorist attack, or some sort of practice run for something down the line?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think, as the President noted, it is -- does appear that there were explosive materials in both of these packages, that they were in a form that was designed to try to carry out some type of attack.\xc2\xa0 The forensic analysis is underway.\xc2\xa0 We are relying heavily and working closely with our partners in this regard.\xc2\xa0 But clearly, from the initial observations, the initial analyses that\'s done, that the materials that were found and the device that was uncovered was intended to do harm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDo harm.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense on the extent of the harm or the extent of the damage that could have been done by this?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, are you looking into the possibility that al-Aulaqi was involved in this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speculate at this point in terms of what the damage could be from the devices, the explosive material that we have found.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the analysis that\'s underway.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still at the very early stage of that analysis. We\'re working, as I said, closely with our partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tClearly, what we are doing is looking at all individuals that we think might be involved in this.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has been rather open in its venom towards the United States, towards Western interests.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of individuals there that we\'re very concerned about, so we\'re looking at all possibilities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhen I had my conversation with President Saleh this morning he did pledge the full cooperation of the Yemeni government.\xc2\xa0 We are working closely with them and we are going to get to the bottom of this plot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did al-Aulaqi\xe2\x80\x99s name come up?\xc2\xa0 Is he considered a top suspect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s associated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is a subject of concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of the quantity of the explosive, even if your analysis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t determined the quality of it yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We have had some preliminary discussions with our partners.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to go into the details about the quantity or the exact types of materials because I think this is still preliminary and I wouldn\'t want to say something that was going to be then corrected in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any suspects in custody?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prior to learning about the plot was the intelligence community aware of this option as a possibility, using cargo planes with packages to attack?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think over the years al Qaeda has demonstrated that it has focused intently on the aviation sector. A lot of its plots have focused on trying to carry out attacks against aircraft, using aircraft also as potential missiles, as we well know.\xc2\xa0 So the aviation industry has taken those steps over the years expressly because al Qaeda -- and when I\'m talking about al Qaeda I\'m not just talking about al Qaeda in the FATA area in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the franchises, including in Yemen, which have demonstrated very clearly that not only are they intending to do certain things against this homeland, but that, as we saw last Christmas Day with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, that they will, in fact, take steps to carry out those intentions.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were cargo planes, though, were those ever focused on as a possibility?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been concerned about passenger aircraft and cargo planes, commercial airliners, others, for many, many years.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I cut off the questions on the fourth row.\xc2\xa0 You had your hand up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes. Were there any suspects -- are there any suspects in custody?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason to believe that this plot goes beyond cargo flights to regular passenger travel, and is there any consideration being given to putting an embargo on packages from Yemen -- originating in Yemen, or even urging people to reconsider travel plans?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'re looking at all possibilities at this point.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t want to presume that we know the bounds of this plot, so we are looking at all types of packages, air travel, whatever.\xc2\xa0 We just want to make sure that we are going to whatever length we need to, to ensure the safety and security of air travel at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And an embargo on any packages originating in Yemen?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are working with the Yemeni government right now.\xc2\xa0 I do believe that it would be prudent and we have taken some steps to ensure that packages that come from Yemen are going to be carefully screened.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with the Yemeni government right now. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo at this point, one of the reasons why we looked at some planes that were coming down into Philadelphia and Newark today is because they were, in fact, carrying cargo from Yemen.\xc2\xa0 So we have had these interagency meetings to discuss all these options. I don\'t want to go into the details of this because this is all part of the security measures that are in place, but several of these measures have already been instituted.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you walk us through the decision to send fighter jets to escort that Emirates flight into JFK today?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 These are decisions that are made by U.S. military/Canadian military air force.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s a threat -- and my understanding -- and I\'ve only seen some of the preliminary reports about this -- is that there was concern about possible cargo on that flight.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, with an abundance of caution, sometimes air force -- our air force, the Canadian air force -- will scramble some jets to make sure that everything is okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of concern about threats against European targets.\xc2\xa0 Is this at all related to any of that chatter that was picked up in recent weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you well know, we issued the travel alert because of concerns about al Qaeda carrying out attacks in Europe; that one package was uncovered in East Midlands Airport in the UK.\xc2\xa0 We are looking at all the parts of the puzzle that we have been piecing together over the past several weeks from al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not presuming that this is part of that plot.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not presuming that we\'ve disrupted that plot.\xc2\xa0 We need to maintain our vigilance. And that\'s the message that we share with our European partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering what the targets were in Chicago, the Jewish places of worship, any extra precautions that you\'re putting out for synagogues?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and other domestic agencies are looking at that very carefully and have reached out to the appropriate private-sector entities as well as organizations to ensure that any other potential targets of such attacks are alerted.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with state and local officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a quick big picture -- the Yemeni cooperation -- considering this is now multiple attempted terrorist attacks it looks like emanating from Yemen, is it fair to say that we don\'t have the best cooperation yet with the Yemeni government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I would say that over the past 22 months or so, during this administration, and even in the prior administration, there has been a steady improvement in that cooperation.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the CT cooperation right now with Yemen is better than it\xe2\x80\x99s been ever before.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it can\xe2\x80\x99t improve more.\xc2\xa0 It needs to improve more.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out to Yemen four times during the past two years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with them.\xc2\xa0 And we found that they are courageous partners.\xc2\xa0 Many Yemenis have lost their lives in the battle against al Qaeda.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have U.S. authorities been able to inspect these packages?\xc2\xa0 Have we increased our presence, or do we plan to do so in Yemen? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd, Robert, Philadelphia and Chicago involved in this -- will the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans this weekend change?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with the authorities both in Dubai, as well as in East Midlands Airport, so that we can participate in whatever investigative efforts that are underway.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And, Wendell, let me just add, the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel plans both this evening and tomorrow at this point are not expected to change.\xc2\xa0 And I think at the end of the statement, the President was clear, as you can see from John and others who have been here overnight, that our counterterrorism professionals are on the job.\xc2\xa0 And the President is not going to change his schedule and there\xe2\x80\x99s no cause for Americans to change their schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you expect this issue to come up at all during the campaign events at all in the next few days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get some guidance from the speechwriters to see if this gets mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, I will say, as the President said, we will take the opportunity if need be throughout the weekend to continue to update the public on information as it comes in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering what al Qaeda has done in the past in targeting other countries during an election season, are you taking that into account that there\xe2\x80\x99s anything -- that this is more than just a coincidence of timing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s never a day that we relax our guard against al Qaeda and its potential to carry out attacks or attempt to do that -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Election Day or any other day of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder, Mr. Brennan, if you can back that tick-tock up just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 What did you know at the time when you briefed the President last night?\xc2\xa0 And were these packages just discovered through random screenings?\xc2\xa0 Or was there something that tipped you off to these packages?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I knew enough last night to be able to brief the President, number one.\xc2\xa0 Number two, I think the American people should feel particularly good that since 9/11, the U.S. government has built up a very, very capable and robust intelligence, law enforcement, homeland security system.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of the strength of that system, information became available that we were able to act upon very quickly and that we were able to locate these packages.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into the details about how we became aware of it.\xc2\xa0 But the redundant layers of security, the tremendous work of the counterterrorism professionals, law enforcement, homeland security, intelligence, was the reason why we were able to succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up on that -- you\xe2\x80\x99re saying then that you were aware of this plot not because of the packages but because of something else?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that whenever you pull a string, there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why you start to pull that string.\xc2\xa0 And we had a reason to pull it.\xc2\xa0 And as a result of what we were able to uncover in East Midlands Airport, with the very strong cooperation of British authorities, we were able to also then take additional steps. And that\'s why those prudent measures were taken today to ensure that we were able to identify any other packages that might be out there of concern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Were you able to -- did you direct the authorities in the East Midlands to look for this package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We were working very closely with our British partners to identify -- locate, identify and isolate that package.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To be clear, which of the two packages was found first? Was it Dubai, and that led you to East Midlands?\xc2\xa0 Or was there any connection --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The first one that was found was East Midlands.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so that -- did that lead you to Dubai then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 The first one we found was East Midlands.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Christie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, the other packages that are being looked at, were they also addressed to destinations in Chicago or also to Jewish organizations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There were two packages, as I said, that we identified -- one in Dubai and one in East Midlands.\xc2\xa0 Both of them were addressed to synagogues in Chicago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say if they\'re -- if any of the other packages that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at now are also addressed to Chicago?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 With all the mail that goes through the system, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t something.\xc2\xa0 But again, the only two packages that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to identify of concern are the one in Dubai and one in East Midlands.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll the other efforts that we have underway is to see whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s something else out there of concern that we can similarly isolate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were either of the Chicago synagogues the one next to the President\xe2\x80\x99s house where I believe he will be staying this weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJosh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, can you just clarify -- so you found the first package after the President was briefed on this issue last night, is that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, from a sequencing standpoint, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it your belief that the institutions in Chicago were the targets of the attack and not, say, the cargo flights?\xc2\xa0 Because you made some reference to the security of cargo flights and so forth.\xc2\xa0 The intent was to injure people at these institutions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 It is less than 24 hours since we first started to look at this very intensively and so it\xe2\x80\x99s still the very early stage of the investigation, and the analysis as far as the intended target, the impact of the explosives, how it could have been used, and I don\'t want to speculate at this point, at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more detail on just the size of these packages?\xc2\xa0 Are these letter bombs?\xc2\xa0 Are they large boxes?\xc2\xa0 And is it your belief they were designed perhaps to explode when opened?\xc2\xa0 Can you give more detail?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 They were not letters.\xc2\xa0 They were larger than that -- think about breadboxes or so in terms of maybe size.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know yet how they were intended to be activated.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we don\'t know if they had a detonator or a main charge?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of things that we know and we\xe2\x80\x99re piecing together those puzzle pieces.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with the British and Emirati authorities.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of forensic work that needs to be done, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still early.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, is there -- is the threat level being -- terror threat level being raised? Also was there any discussion with these planes in the air of the President\xe2\x80\x99s shoot-down authority or landing them elsewhere?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 No, there was no discussion of that.\xc2\xa0 What we were looking for were packages and, therefore, we took the steps that were appropriate to ensure that we were able to identify where packages were globally, as well as where they might be as they were coming into the United States.\xc2\xa0 And so the measures that we took were appropriate to the concern that we had at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the threat level?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We are right now making sure that we are able to stay as vigilant as possible.\xc2\xa0 There has been no adjustment of the threat level in terms of color code, whatever else.\xc2\xa0 But as a result of this, we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with our state and local officials, and law enforcement, homeland security and intelligence communities are very much on their guard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get someone to clarify -- and it follows up on Ann\xe2\x80\x99s question -- with the packages themselves, what made the packages suspicious, or something else led you to the package?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 As I said, the American people should be very pleased that we were able to get insight into the fact that there were suspicious packages out there that we had to find.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into those operational details.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why we have a security system in place that has these redundancies and the ability to detect things, from inception all the way to the possible execution of an operation.\xc2\xa0 So we were on to this, but I\'m not going to get into details about how we knew.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say you were looking for the suspicious packages?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We were looking for packages that were of concern, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any impact whatsoever on the President\xe2\x80\x99s Asia trip, in terms of threat level assessments?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Whenever the President travels, we take a very careful look at what the threat environment might be and look at what the terrorist environment is.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re taking this into account, but at this point there is no effect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, early on there had been a lot of speculation that this might be some kind of a dry run.\xc2\xa0 Given what you do know about these packages now, would you say that this was more than just a dry run?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I\'m concerned that since there were explosive materials in it, a traditional dry run is something that you would not necessarily use with explosive materials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet what exactly the intent was at this point.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of different scenarios that some people have speculated about, but -- and what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is wrestle this to the ground by doing a good forensic analysis, as well as taking a look from an intelligence standpoint and trying to piece together what we might have known in the past and that would give us a sense of how this was going to be used.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say, sir, that al Qaeda have changed their locations of the country, and also these are the same people?\xc2\xa0 And finally, does this threat of these packages have anything to do with the Pakistani man arrested from Ashburn, Virginia? Because he spoke in the past that attacks will be taking place in the Washington area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There is no indication whatsoever that the individual arrested yesterday had anything to do with this plot. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is an organization of several hundred individuals that are dispersed throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 They are murderers and they are determined to carry out attacks against innocent lives, whether they be Yemeni, Americans, Westerners or others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe are working very closely with the Yemeni government, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some significant progress against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula inside of Yemen, working with those partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do this.\xc2\xa0 If anything, this just demonstrates to us, and I think to the Yemenis as well, that we need to redouble our efforts so that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to destroy al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And we will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, if you have briefed the Indian government, because the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans next week, as far as this trip is concerned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 We share on a regular basis with the Indian government.\xc2\xa0 The Indian government is one of our best CT partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Josh.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think, Mr. Brennan, in the past when there have been specific attacks, as has been highlighted by the administration, that terrorists have had to modify their ways because of the hurdles that the government has thrown up in front of them -- do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we saw here, the use of cargo planes instead of passenger planes reflect the intense scrutiny that passenger aircraft have gotten in the last year or so since they\xe2\x80\x99ve come under -- being used as a vehicle for attacks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN: Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 The al Qaeda organization has tried to adapt to all of the obstacles and hurdles we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in front of it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to remain very agile.\xc2\xa0 We have to make sure that we stay one step ahead of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut clearly, they are looking to identify vulnerabilities in our system and take advantage of those vulnerabilities.\xc2\xa0 But fortunately, because of, again, the good work of the people here, as well as the very important partnership that we have with our allies overseas, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to stay ahead of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised that they keep focusing on airplanes -- so long after 9/11, that still remains an attraction for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about al Qaeda that surprises me anymore.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have to be prepared to deal with every eventuality that is out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did your response to this in the last 24, 36 hours, to this incident, differ from the response to Abdulmutallab over the holidays last year?\xc2\xa0 And what did you learn from the last year attempted Christmas Day bombing that helped you better prepare for this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 In some respects, they\xe2\x80\x99re very different because you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with two packages as opposed to an individual, but in other respects, there are similarities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat we -- whenever something like this happens, what we want to do is to make sure that we take all appropriate measures to identify additional threats that are out there.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who arrived in Detroit or whether a package is found in East Midlands, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to find are there other individuals that are trying to blow up a plane?\xc2\xa0 Are there other packages out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so the community kicked into gear right away and took those steps so that we would find out where those packages were and take the appropriate steps with TSA, FAA and others, and the system worked very, very well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam, do you have a follow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was just going to ask you, how do you respond to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s sure to be accusations that this is all happening a couple days before an election, used to sway the election towards Democrats.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- John briefed the President at 10:35 p.m. last night off of very credible terror information.\xc2\xa0 And after -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s largely put to rest any speculation that may be out there after the testing the President talked about that showed apparent explosives in those devices.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs John said, counterterrorism officials at all levels of our government quickly went into action in order to take the steps necessary to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 That has -- that is exactly what has governed his actions and the actions of those in this government since that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, how many credible threats have come from Yemen in the last two years?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a number of threat streams that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been following, a number of individuals that we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What number?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a number to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dozens? We know of under 10.\xc2\xa0 How many --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a question about whether or not there\xe2\x80\x99s reports of a threat that may be separate from other reporting.\xc2\xa0 Is it part of the same threat stream?\xc2\xa0 Sometimes we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that al Qaeda is trying to carry out some type of attack, so we might have dozens upon dozens of reports related to that one attack.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo over the past year, the intelligence community, the counterterrorism community has been kept very busy with reports about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula trying to carry out attacks in Yemen and in that region, as well as against the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to call AQAP the primary terrorist threat to the United States?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BRENNAN:\xc2\xa0 I think my concern is, outside of the Afghan-Pakistan area where the al Qaeda core and senior leadership reside, I would say that the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the most active operational franchise right now of al Qaeda and that this is one that deserves a lot of our attention.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any concerns, Robert, that the President is going to be having a rah-rah rally tonight while all the cable channels and local news stations and everybody else is going to be airing this terrorism scare?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, Chip, I think the President was quite clear on this, that we are taking this threat very seriously.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, he is not, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people should have any reason to change the way they go about their lives or change their schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI will say this, that we are -- regardless of whatever season we\xe2\x80\x99re in, our commitment, Democrat and Republican, to keep this country safe will not waver.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he talk about this tonight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to check on that when I go back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tListen, let me get John back to working on this.\xc2\xa0 We will, as we get information, update you if there are any additions to his schedule or what have you over the course of the weekend. Stay in touch, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know as we get more information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Brennan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t5:00 P.M.
