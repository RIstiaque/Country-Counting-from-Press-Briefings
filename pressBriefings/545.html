EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us on our early start this morning.\xc2\xa0 We are making our way to Mexico for the North American Leaders Summit.\xc2\xa0 And I have with me today Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes, who can assist on questions you may have about national security and foreign affairs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Let me just start by saying, as I think you know, later on this flight, the President will sign an executive order on streamlining the export-import process for America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses. In his State of the Union address, President Obama set an ambitious agenda to make 2014 a \xe2\x80\x9cYear of Action,\xe2\x80\x9d using his pen and his phone to take steps to expand opportunity for America\xe2\x80\x99s middle class, including helping small, American businesses compete in a global economy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, as I said, aboard Air Force One, the President will sign a new executive order on streamlining the export-import process for America\xe2\x80\x99s businesses, specifically the executive order that cuts processing and approval times from days to minutes for small businesses that export American-made goods and services by completing the International Trade Data System by December 2016. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Today, businesses must submit information to dozens of government agencies, often on paper forms -- sometimes waiting on process for days to move goods across the border.\xc2\xa0 The ITDS will allow businesses to electronically transmit through a single window the data required by the U.S. government to import or export cargo.\xc2\xa0 This new electronic system will speed up the shipment of American-made goods overseas, eliminate often duplicative and burdensome paperwork, and make our government more efficient.</p>\n<p class="p2">I have no other announcements to make, so if you have questions on domestic matters, why don\'t you fire away?\xc2\xa0 And then we\'ll turn it over to Ben.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can you talk about -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the U.S. response to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Ukraine, the violence there?\xc2\xa0 Have there been conversations with both President Putin and with Ukrainian leadership?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the scenes that we saw in Kyiv yesterday were completely outrageous and have no place in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we have made it very clear to the Ukrainian government that it is their responsibility to allow for peaceful protest.\xc2\xa0 We consistently oppose any use of violence by all sides, but the responsibility is on the government to pull back its riot police, to call a truce and to engage in a meaningful discussion with the opposition about the way forward.</p>\n<p class="p3">Clearly, the people of Ukraine feel that their legitimate aspirations are not being met in the current political context, and it\'s incumbent on the Ukrainian government to reach out to the opposition and to find a way forward that can unify the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We have also made clear that Ukraine has a future that is a part of the Atlantic community, that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s orientation towards Europe and the Transatlantic community is an important priority of U.S. foreign policy; that it is not a zero-sum game with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We understand that Ukraine is a neighbor of Russia, has historic ties to Russia, but that that need not preclude Ukraine from, again, continuing to pursue a European path as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">So Vice President Biden communicated our position to President Yanukovych yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Kerry, Victoria Nuland are working this with their counterparts, particularly as the EU prepares for a meeting.\xc2\xa0 The only additional thing I\'d say is that we continue to watch events very closely, including who we believe is responsible for violence, and we\'ve made clear that we would consider taking action against individuals who are responsible for acts of violence within Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we have a tool kit for doing that that includes sanctions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether the United States would consider following the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s lead if they impose sanctions against the Ukraine as an institution?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as a general matter we aim to be coordinated with the European Union and we have generally had a common position and spoken with a similar voice on issues related to Ukraine because we both have an interest in seeing an end to the violence and seeing the unity of Ukraine upheld and seeing Ukraine on a European orientation.\xc2\xa0 So I think we are in consultation with the European Union on the questions like which individuals should be held responsible for the violence, and in consideration of issues like imposing sanctions related to the ongoing violence.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys have been talking about sanctions now for a while.\xc2\xa0 What would it actually take to pull the trigger?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the events that we saw yesterday are certainly heightening our focus on this issue and I think we\'ll be reviewing this, as we have been, on a near daily basis. And we also will be talking to the Europeans as they have their meeting of the EU foreign ministers, and we\'ll make a determination both on our own and, again, in consultation with the European Union about the next steps.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that near-term thing, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, would there be a determination like this within days, weeks?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the situation is very fluid, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put a timeline on it or get ahead of any particular announcement.\xc2\xa0 I will say that events like what we saw yesterday are clearly going to impact our decision-making.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, if the government takes the appropriate steps of pulling back riot police, of respecting the right of peaceful protest, releasing prisoners and pursuing serious dialogue with the opposition about how to pursue a more unified government and way forward, that would obviously factor into our calculus as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">But, clearly, the United States and the European Union believe that the events of yesterday were unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see renewed diplomatic activity this week.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent does Russia have a role in either reducing the violence or creating additional disturbances?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the message that we delivered to the Russians is that, again, we are not in some competition for the future of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, our interest is that the people of Ukraine are able to determine their future, not any external actor.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, we believe that a significant number of Ukrainians believe very deeply in the importance of Ukraine pursuing a European orientation, even as they maintain relations with Russia as a neighbor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And so the role we would like to see Russia play is of constructive support for reducing these tensions and allowing the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there should be, again, a situation where Russia is viewing this as some competition with the European Union or the United States; rather, we all have an interest in a Ukraine that is stable.\xc2\xa0 And, clearly, the status quo is not a recipe for stability, because too many Ukrainians are feeling like their own aspirations are not being met in this government and in this plan that turns away from Europe.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the message we delivered to the Ukrainian government and the Russian government as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So far, Vice President Biden has been your main interlocutor on this.\xc2\xa0 Is there a point at which the President gets to follow up directly?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I would expect the President -- he\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in the sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s followed the situation very closely.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s discussed it with counterparts in the past; with President Hollande this was a subject of discussion.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d expect the President to be involved in the days to come as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Again, he has pressed us to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to try to reduce tensions and to try to stabilize the situation and support the democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people for a more unified government and a government that has the ability to pursue a European orientation as well as good relations with Russia.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I\xe2\x80\x99d expect him to be involved.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d expect it to come up today, frankly.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pressing global issue and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing this with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto and Prime Minister Harper.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he watching any of the television footage from Kyiv or anything?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen particular footage, but he has been getting very regular updates on the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to say anything publicly today or for it to be more in the meetings with the other leaders?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the focus of these meetings.\xc2\xa0 The focus of these meetings is our North American partnership, trade and commerce, and increasing economic competitiveness in the North American region, security issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">However, it being a significant global issue, I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate that he will have some public comment on it, as well as comment with the other leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about the executive order a little bit?\xc2\xa0 This system has been in the works for a while.\xc2\xa0 Why was an executive order necessary?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the President has the authority through an executive order to streamline the process on behalf of American businesses, in particular small businesses.\xc2\xa0 And, as you know, while he has taken an approach since he took office that includes not just acting legislatively, but using his executive authority where he can on behalf of the American people, he has tasked his team with finding opportunities for him to use that authority in a way that benefits the American economy and the American people.\xc2\xa0 This is an example of that.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said numerous times in recent days that it\'s no surprise that Democrats as well as Republicans have their problems with trade-expanding agreements.\xc2\xa0 But the enthusiasm among Democrats seems particularly slight this time around compared to last -- past rounds of big trade deals.\xc2\xa0 What can the President say to reassure Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto and Harper that there\xe2\x80\x99s any hope whatsoever for accomplishing trade deals this year?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Mark, the President has made clear that expanding American exports and trade, especially in the Pacific region, is a priority.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous growth and opportunity in that region, and absent an agreement that allows for expansion we would cede that territory to our competitors, which would be detrimental to our economy, to our middle class.\xc2\xa0 He is pursuing an agreement, the TPP, that explicitly protects American workers and the environment, and that he believes would be highly beneficial to our economy and the middle class.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation he has and others have with lawmakers of both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that this is an issue around which there is not a uniform point of view in either party.\xc2\xa0 And the President has long understood that.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is worth noting that this is nothing new, especially for those of us who have been around Washington for more than 20 years.</p>\n<p class="p3">But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a reason to make it a priority.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\'s a priority and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have those conversations.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\'ll make his views known in his conversations with the other two leaders today.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 One thing to add is that this has been an ongoing negotiation for several years, so there\xe2\x80\x99s been a very sustained effort over a period of years, precisely because this represents an agreement that would encompass 40 percent of the global economy and have huge opportunity for the United States and the countries involved.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the reason why Canada and Mexico came into this process.</p>\n<p class="p2">What I\xe2\x80\x99d say also, though, is that, first of all, we see this as an opportunity to introduce elevated standards on issues like labor and the environment that were not in NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 So, in many respects, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to, again, elevate the standards that were absent from the NAFTA agreement so that we are dealing with issues like labor and environmental standards that are important to 21st century trade.</p>\n<p class="p2">The other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say, though, is that as you get further along in a trade negotiation, there are sensitive issues in every country.\xc2\xa0 Trade is not simply an issue that has a significant range of opinions in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Every country in a negotiation always has constituencies that have a divergence of views on issues in a trade agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think these leaders, like all leaders involved in the agreement, understand and appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 As you continue towards the end of a negotiation, you get into sensitive issues and you will have an effort undertaken to build support for an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And so I think the leaders know exactly where things are in the negotiation and appreciate that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the decision to make this such a short trip?\xc2\xa0 Any concern at all that this could be viewed as a bit of a snub by Mexico?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 This is our second visit to Mexico since President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto became President.\xc2\xa0 We had a full bilateral summit in Mexico City and had two days of good meetings and a dinner with the President the last time we were here.\xc2\xa0 So this is not the first time the President has been to Mexico since President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto took office.</p>\n<p class="p2">I think if you look at the history of the North American Leaders Summit, it\xe2\x80\x99s generally a one-day meeting, so this is consistent with summits that have been held in the past, including summits in the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Keystone, Harper told reporters yesterday his message to our President will be the same as he said publicly.\xc2\xa0 What will President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message be back to Harper on that discussion today?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will say the same thing that he and I and others have said publicly, which is this a process that is run out of the State Department in keeping with past practice of administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0 We have reached a stage in that process with the release of the environmental impact statement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now in a phase where there is input from agencies -- others agencies and from the public, and that that process needs to be insulated from politics -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- and that he will explain that to both leaders.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99re fully aware of that dynamic.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you can say the timeline of a likely decision, though, without commenting on the substance of it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The timeline is as I just relayed to you and we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed publicly, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that is institutionalized by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re now in a phase of input from agencies and the public, and the process will move forward.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to alter the process; we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let it proceed the way it should, because these are issues, as the President said, that have to be determined based on what is viewed as in the best national interest of the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Immigration is a big issue in Mexico.\xc2\xa0 In his bilat with President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto, what will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the best chances on the timing of passage of immigration reform?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe that 2014 presents the best opportunity we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to see comprehensive immigration reform become law.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a ways to go, but the Senate has passed a bill with bipartisan support and a large majority.\xc2\xa0 The House, through its leadership, has taken steps by putting forth standards and principles.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a new development this year that represents progress and demonstrates that Republican leaders recognize the value of immigration reform and the benefit that it would provide to our economy, to our border security, to our middle class, and to innovation for our businesses.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President will update both leaders on where that stands, and his hope and belief that the question around comprehensive immigration reform is not if but when, and we hope it\xe2\x80\x99s this year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you guys having any kind of communiqu\xc3\xa9 or deliverable-specific tangible things you\xe2\x80\x99re planning to announce as a result of today?\xc2\xa0 Or is it mainly a matter of catching up and sort of updating each other on where things stand?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d expect there to be a leaders\xe2\x80\x99 statement at the conclusion of the summit that addresses the agenda that we will have worked on.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think if you look at the North American Leaders Summit, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a venue for us to do two things:\xc2\xa0 in the near term, to work through specific issues related to trade and commerce.\xc2\xa0 That gets at cross-border trade, customs issues, supporting the free flow of commerce, but also secure borders, efforts to promote security in North America more broadly.\xc2\xa0 We have energy cooperation and cooperation on climate change.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of near-term steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing today and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to address at the conclusion of the summit.</p>\n<p class="p2">At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re also looking to what is our vision for North America more broadly going forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a huge asset of the United States, frankly, to have such close relationships with our two neighbors, two significant trading partners.\xc2\xa0 And we cooperate on issues that run the gamut from trade to the environment, to energy and climate change, to security.\xc2\xa0 And so what is the vision of a stable, secure, prosperous North America looking ahead, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll also be addressing that as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, going at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re marking the 20th anniversary of NAFTA, a lot of debate -- good, bad.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of NAFTA?\xc2\xa0 Even though he\xe2\x80\x99s had some issues with it, was it overall a success?\xc2\xa0 Was it something that he wishes didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?\xc2\xa0 What is his view of that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, on the one hand, NAFTA supports a huge amount of trade that supports a significant number of U.S. jobs.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the trade between the United States and Mexico and Canada, millions of U.S. jobs are associated with that.\xc2\xa0 I think it has led to a more prosperous and competitive North America as a whole within the global economy.\xc2\xa0 So there has been progress that is rooted in the trade relationship between the United States, Canada and Mexico.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">At the same time, there are issues that were not addressed in NAFTA, like the labor and environmental standards that the President has spoken about in the past and that, frankly, are a part of the TPP agreement.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we see NAFTA as providing, clearly, a foundation for trade in North America that can be improved and enhanced by elevating the standards of trade to include the issues that are of increasing attention to us.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at TPP, that\xe2\x80\x99s labor and the environment, but also issues related to intellectual property and state-owned enterprises, access to the Pacific markets.</p>\n<p class="p2">So what you really want, Peter, is a dynamic where the North American competitiveness allows us to be drivers in terms of getting into the fastest emerging markets in the world, which are in this Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re in a good position to do that given our own trade relationship, but we also can, frankly, go back and elevate some of the issues that were not a part of the original agreement through the TPP.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, last year when we were in Mexico, one of the issues that hung over at those meetings was the level of cooperation taking place between the new Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto administration and the U.S. over security.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the status of that?\xc2\xa0 Has the Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto administration made inroads on the security issue to the satisfaction of the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. view of security?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have maintained our security cooperation with Mexico.\xc2\xa0 We are very pleased with the level of cooperation that we have with the Mexican government in addressing the narcotrafficking issue.\xc2\xa0 President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto is focused on reducing the levels of violence, broadly.\xc2\xa0 We continue to provide whatever support the Mexican government asks us for and requires as they deal with huge border security -- huge issues of violence around the border, and because of the narcotrafficking issue.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to make clear our own responsibilities to crack down, for instance, on the flow of guns southward, which has been an element of the violence there.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the cooperation has continued.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been good from our perspective, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ll address it in their bilateral meeting, as well as in the trilat.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say, since nobody asked -- hey, Christi, did you have a question?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, so a couple of things have happened this week related to the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary focus on growing the economy and expanding opportunity that are rather remarkable.\xc2\xa0 First of all, you see Republicans lining up en masse against raising the minimum wage, which is a remarkable development if you think about it.\xc2\xa0 You have Americans across the country working full-time and yet being paid a wage that keeps them in poverty.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that should happen in this country.\xc2\xa0 And the American people, including Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 constituents, overwhelmingly support lifting the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0As the CBO report demonstrated, that would lift something on the order of 900,000 Americans out of poverty and raise the wages for 16 million-plus Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 And as Jason Furman said, the substantial consensus among economists is that it would not have a negative impact on jobs.</p>\n<p class="p2">The second thing that happened was the five-year anniversary of the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And as a point of personal privilege as somebody who was covering these matters back in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s, I find it remarkable that Speaker Boehner attacks the President for the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 I remember when Speaker Boehner powerfully argued against President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda, said that it would lead to stagnation and job loss.\xc2\xa0 He could not have been more wrong then.\xc2\xa0 We saw record job creation.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner was wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Speaker Boehner argued powerfully against the Recovery Act and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, we\'ve seen the creation of 8.5 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner could not have been more wrong.\xc2\xa0 In between, Speaker Boehner supported economic policies that helped to precipitate the worst financial crisis and economic crisis in our lifetimes and, by the way, led to record deficits, which were handed over to President Obama when he took office.</p>\n<p class="p2">It\'s very important to have the long view here.\xc2\xa0 And what we know about the Recovery Act is that it delivered tax cuts, it delivered investments in clean energy, it delivered an infusion in an economy that was teetering on the brink of collapse.\xc2\xa0 And the alternative at the time, as you remember if you saw the headlines, was the potential for depression, some predicting 20 to 25 percent unemployment.\xc2\xa0 Republicans refused to support a plan that saved the country from that kind of disaster and set us on the course towards job creation and economic growth.</p>\n<p class="p2">This is not a project that\'s anywhere near done.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President remains focused principally on growing the economy, helping the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And certainly raising the minimum wage is a way to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, since you brought it up, on the CBO, it\xe2\x80\x99s been remarkable cherry-picking of the results of the conclusions of that report by both sides.\xc2\xa0 How can it be that those economists can be right on one issue from your side, the raising people out of poverty, but so wrong on the job costs of that report?\xc2\xa0 And is there a danger in going after what is usually considered a fairly neutral arbiter of economic issues and budget issues?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, we\'re not going after anyone.\xc2\xa0 As Jason Furman, the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief economist, said yesterday, we respectfully disagree with that particular conclusion and point to the deep and wide body of academic research on this that supports our view.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not about -- obviously we have enormous respect for the CBO, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the fact that we point to some of the other conclusions in that report.</p>\n<p class="p2">It\xe2\x80\x99s just demonstrated by history and, again, by the work of many experts in the field that there\xe2\x80\x99s likely to have no negative impact in terms of job creation by raising the minimum wage, which spurs economic activity, lifts people out of poverty, and raises the wages for Americans across the country, including middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a respectful disagreement on a particular finding in which the experts in the field have expressed a different view.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you must have felt that that report was damaging to your efforts to get support for raising the minimum wage.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that Republicans who, against the overwhelming opinion of the American people, rally around that particular item in the report to suggest that we can\xe2\x80\x99t give Americans a raise risk more damage to themselves and politically, as well as to the middle class economically, and to Americans economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we view it that way.\xc2\xa0 Support for raising the minimum wage is broad and deep.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen states take action, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press the Congress to take action.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t10:19 A.M.
