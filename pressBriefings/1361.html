b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>1:10 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS: I\'ll do one quick readout before we do Q&amp;A here.<br/>\nThe President spoke late this morning with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 They discussed how best to work together to achieve comprehensive peace in the Middle East, in particularly by making full use of substantive proximity talks between Israel and the Palestinians and transitioning to direct negotiations as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 They also discussed regional challenges and the President reaffirmed his unshakeable commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>The call took place just before noon and lasted 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the oil spill, two questions on BP.\xc2\xa0 One is my understanding is that the Oil Pollution Act caps their liability beyond cleanup costs at $75 million, so I\'m wondering how you will make sure that they do in fact pay other costs -- wages, et cetera.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check -- I would need to check with Interior on that, on the $75 million figure.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I think there are different provisions for different things, but let me take that question and try to find that out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it your commitment that BP will pay all costs associated with this spill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is our commitment, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including like lost wages and that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s specifically one of the things the President spoke with Thad Allen about and with parish presidents and fishermen yesterday, is setting up a system -- and Secretary Napolitano talked about this, this morning -- setting up a system for compensation and claims that isn\xe2\x80\x99t bogged down.\xc2\xa0 Fishermen particularly are -- we understand what they catch -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to sell what they catch in order to spend money to go back out and do it again.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we\'ve got to set up a system that is -- that provides for that to happen quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just generally, what is your satisfaction level with BP\xe2\x80\x99s performance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible; we have oversight.\xc2\xa0 I did this a couple times I think yesterday -- look, there are many different things that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost is capping this well.\xc2\xa0 There were tests over the weekend on the application of sub-sea dispersant, which have thus far performed well and they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to test that -- which is, instead of spraying the dispersant on the surface of the water, it is to release the dispersant near the source of the leak.\xc2\xa0 And that had some positive impact during the first round of testing.</p>\n<p>The second -- the relief well began -- the drilling began on that last evening, which is a more long-term solution.\xc2\xa0 Obviously BP is working on a structure to possibly put on top of the well and vacuum up the oil to the surface with the water to deal with that.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one aspect of what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with, as the pollutants rise to the surface, containing the spread of that oil on the surface of the water and how that affects both the environment that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with as well as the local economy.</p>\n<p>I would say all of those things are what we are overseeing. They\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they have the unique equipment for dealing with this at a depth of 5,000 feet under the floor -- under the surface of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 But we are going to continue to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that they need to do from the perspective of state, local and federal authorities.</p>\n<p>Secretary Napolitano, Secretary Salazar and Lisa Jackson are meeting this afternoon with BP to get an update from them on their ongoing process and to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking the steps that we feel are necessary to respond to an incident of this magnitude.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My understanding is it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the BP CEO that\xe2\x80\x99s having a meeting today.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Actually the guidance I have has the CEO and the American chair.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me -- I have two questions, one to follow on BP, which is can you tell me who the President has actually spoken with at BP?\xc2\xa0 And then also if any reaction on Ahmadinejad\xe2\x80\x99s comments that he made today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has spoken with anybody at BP.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, they have -- Secretary Salazar convened a meeting with the CEOs of the oil companies last week.\xc2\xa0 I think we put that list of folks out.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Salazar was in Houston at the BP command center, and these individuals will meet with BP later on -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s at 3:00 p.m. today.</p>\n<p>Look, I think the speech that you heard today was predictable in that Iran failed to speak about the obligations that it won\xe2\x80\x99t live up to.\xc2\xa0 And I think rightly, our delegation and many others left as a series of wild accusations were made during the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it will have any influence on the movement toward actually getting some sanctions against them -- more sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the speech today -- I think those that have -- those that are involved in the NPT conference and are living up to the obligations would have wanted to hear the Iranians discuss living up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 I think them not doing that again shows how further isolated they are from the world community.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to make progress on sanctions at a multilateral level even as we look at ways that we can do so within our own government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Progress, how so?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Continue to meet with the U.N. Security Council and continue to make progress moving forward on a Security Council resolution.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first one is, we hear so many different time frames as to when this oil well will actually be under control.\xc2\xa0 What is the best case and what is the worst-case scenario?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing anywhere from a matter of days to 90 days in the worst case.\xc2\xa0 What is your sense of how long --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would direct you to BP in terms of what they might say.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think a series of processes that, as you said, could take a matter of days.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I forget the exact term of the structure putting on top of the valve would take probably another week.\xc2\xa0 The original well took 90 days to drill and it could take that long to drill a relief well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if it takes up to 90 days, is that the something that the President is comfortable with?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the President can alter the pace of drilling in the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s what we\'re looking at.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I mean, in the Gulf, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 We\'re -- I used this phrase yesterday, as Secretary Salazar used this phrase, and that is we are going to do what we have to do.\xc2\xa0 We will keep our, as Secretary Salazar said, our boot on the throat of BP to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that they -- all that is necessary, while we do all that is humanly possible to deal with this incident.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder, on the plane ride back yesterday, did the President share any personal reflections with you about what he saw on the ground, how he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling about all this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the -- I talked a little bit about this on the trip home.\xc2\xa0 You get a real sense of the topography, the geography of what we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with, and how -- the President said that you could see from the air the -- the wetlands in that area, obviously, have undergone lots of change and not for the good over the past many years.\xc2\xa0 The President said you could see that from the air.</p>\n<p>Speaking with the parish presidents, speaking with the local fishermen, you get a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, both environmentally and economically.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President reiterated to all of us, as he has said over many, many days, and that is we must do all that we can, as aggressively as we can, to combat this incident.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just want to follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 When you say, \xe2\x80\x9ckeep your boot on the throat of BP,\xe2\x80\x9d obviously sounds tough, but how do you actually follow up on it when, as was pointed out, the liability cap seems to be $75 million?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will check on that before we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, because Senator Menendez has a bill he just introduced today with other senators, saying he wants to expand it from $75 million to I think $10 billion.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier, we want to set up a system to make sure BP pays more than just the cleanup; pays for lost wages, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 What kind of system can you set up retroactively if the law is the law?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, the law provides for -- BP is the responsible party, right?\xc2\xa0 So if local fishermen can\xe2\x80\x99t fish, that\'s an economic loss that BP is going to have to pay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about setting up the actual system for the filing of those claims with BP and others in order to get them reimbursed as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a retroactive thing, though.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they\xe2\x80\x99re just responsible for cleanup and containment, can you really force them to pay the lost wages?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of the law.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 The economic damages that are incurred are part of the cost of this incident.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister Netanyahu call -- there have been reports that President Abbas may be coming to the White House in mid-May to try to get Mideast peace talks.\xc2\xa0 Where are you on whether he\xe2\x80\x99s coming?\xc2\xa0 Are you inviting him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the Supreme Court, where is the President in his decision-making process?\xc2\xa0 We know he did some interviews, face-to-face interviews with potential nominees last week.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate more face-to-face meetings this week?\xc2\xa0 Is he close to a decision?\xc2\xa0 Where are you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Close.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Close as in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more with your characterization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Close.\xc2\xa0 So how close?\xc2\xa0 Is he -- will he announce it this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I was thinking about this as I was\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\ngetting a series of emails, will it be today, will it be tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I am happy to advise you of when the event is when we do announce it.\xc2\xa0 I think it would be -- might be duplicative to announce each day when the event is not going to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but last week you did.\xc2\xa0 You ruled out last week.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I did rule out last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you rule out this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, there you go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooooh!</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hmmm --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See, I just had a whole week\xe2\x80\x99s worth of duplicative email -- (laughter) -- that\'s awesome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has a lot of free time -- not free time, but I mean not public time on his schedule today -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, where you got the impression that the President has a ton of free time, I --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What are you guys watching at CBS that I\'m not afforded to watch at --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot on his public schedule.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to forward that along to him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he doing -- is he using that time to do some interviews with Supreme Court nominees today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the interview process that the President has.\xc2\xa0 I will -- safe to say, Chip, there is a lot on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plate and a lot that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing out of the watchful eye of the public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And today does that include Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that he is working on the process of the Supreme Court, without getting into the specifics of what those actions might be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is his involvement, how actively involved is he in either getting information or whatever else on the Times Square situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, in traveling to the Gulf, John Brennan was with us, briefed the President on the helicopter ride from here to Andrews on Times Square.\xc2\xa0 We spent about 50 minutes in the conference room of Air Force One on the ride down on the Gulf -- the situation in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 John got information throughout the day and passed that along to the President and has done so again today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there anything new on claims from groups overseas that they were responsible for this?\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are actively participating in the investigation, making sure that local authorities have all the resources necessary to determine who is responsible.\xc2\xa0 We have not made that determination yet, but that\xe2\x80\x99s actively ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the \xe2\x80\x9cboot on the throat\xe2\x80\x9d thing, Ed said it sounds tough.\xc2\xa0 Well, it actually sounds hostile.\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate reflection of the relationship between the federal government and BP right now?\xc2\xa0 Is it a hostile relationship?\xc2\xa0 Do you really need to keep your boot on their throat in order to get them to act?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- I think the expression largely conveys that while the responsible party is BP, we will do, as the oversight authority in managing the cleanup, the spread -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything that it can and should do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President heard yesterday from local officials that were concerned about the plans for -- the plans that BP had when the oil got closer to different parishes for extra booming and for different activities that could be undertaken.\xc2\xa0 The President understands that frustration and worked -- Admiral Allen met with the parish presidents in order to get -- move the process with BP forward more quickly.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the process that has been ongoing throughout this and will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President feels like he needs to keep his boot on their throat?\xc2\xa0 Is that the way he\xe2\x80\x99s reacting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President accurately conveyed in his remarks yesterday that we are going to do everything humanly possible, and ensure that BP is doing everything humanly possible, to deal with this as comprehensively and as quickly as they can.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration feel that BP has done a good job with this cleanup?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to what I said.\xc2\xa0 We are going to, every day, evaluate what has to happen, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s not being done, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not ready to give an endorsement or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we still have an active incident.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be pleased when there\xe2\x80\x99s no more oil leaking from the floor of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 The President will be pleased when we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken sufficient measure to ensure that its spread isn\xe2\x80\x99t vast.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- this is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s going to, as the President said yesterday, is going to take some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the extent there are any deficiencies in the cleanup process, does the federal government have some responsibility for that?\xc2\xa0 You guys have taken pains to emphasize that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved in day one directing and overseeing BP\xe2\x80\x99s response --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- the law mandates, based on the incidents that happened in Alaska in the late \xe2\x80\x9880s, to ensure that companies that cause these type of accidents don\xe2\x80\x99t hand the taxpayers of this country a bill and walk away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but in terms of what they decide to do or how they try to mitigate it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why I used Secretary Salazar\xe2\x80\x99s colorful phraseology to talk about the role that we\xe2\x80\x99re playing and the role that Thad Allen as the National Incident Commander, and others are playing in order to ensure that BP does everything it can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if Gulf Coast residents find the response in any way lacking, would it be fair for them to hold the federal government responsible as well as BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is doing everything we can to respond.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, we have been there since the very beginning in responding to the reports of -- the accurate reports of an explosion, with the Coast Guard assisting in the recovery efforts.\xc2\xa0 That began our effort in this and it won\xe2\x80\x99t stop for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say that the taxpayer, the American taxpayer will not face any cleanup costs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The commitment the President made yesterday is the responsible party will pay for this and that responsible party is BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And regardless of caps or anything, somehow, something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will look into the notion of caps.\xc2\xa0 I will look into that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know that the review is ongoing, but is there any way you can point to where -- what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at?\xc2\xa0 Is this a regulatory issue for the federal government, where regulators fell down on the job?\xc2\xa0 Is it a technological issue?\xc2\xa0 Where is this review headed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s charge to Secretary Salazar over the course of the next 30 days is to examine every aspect of what may have gone wrong and contributed to, or caused the incident that we have -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with in the Gulf today.\xc2\xa0 And his charge is wide open and I believe that what he finds will determine our next steps as it relates to offshore oil policy.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say the company is responsible and the government has oversight, does that mean that the government is ultimately in charge of the cleanup?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the responsible party is BP.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of the cleanup operation?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s calling the shots?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The National Incident Commander is overseeing to ensure that BP does what is necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then will the government ultimately hand BP a tab for every dime that, say, the Coast Guard, the EPA, and every other agency --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s like a running account of this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They will -- we discussed this in a number of meetings here last week, that specific actions -- these are the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take and these are -- this is who will pay for it, yes.\xc2\xa0 And again that\xe2\x80\x99s -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s dictated by the law.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s dictated by the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the Valdez --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 From the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on what kind of a claims process you want to establish?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can -- let me put you in touch with the Joint Information Center down there for a more technical analysis.\xc2\xa0 But the President wants something that is not duplicative, that is not overly bureaucratic, one that -- obviously, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got folks that are losing money because they are unable to do what they do for a living.\xc2\xa0 Those are people that can\xe2\x80\x99t be out of -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s how you make your living, losing that money is a very big deal.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that that money is made up as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the President have any plans or does he want to meet with the CEO or president of BP?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just a matter of they haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the schedule together yet or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the -- I think those that are meeting with him -- with the CEO and the president today are -- and again, Secretary Salazar has been in touch with folks at BP throughout this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the dinner tonight, the Executive Committee dinner, will the President be sounding out any members of the Executive Committee on a new program or new policies in advance of his speech tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President -- there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot on the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s docket right now in terms of financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will reiterate his support for, and ask business for their support for, financial regulations, discuss the efforts that the administration is currently undertaking to rebuild the economy and to put in place an environment for continued hiring.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful and optimistic that by the end of the week, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have another positive month of job growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a readout?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do on that yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned financial reform. There\xe2\x80\x99s a package of amendments being proposed for the financial reform pending in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 One of them is calling for a tax on excessive bonuses on firms that got individual assistance from the government.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to have those guys take a look at the amendment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has BP been truthful with the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In all of its -- either representing what its doing, what it\xe2\x80\x99s capable of doing, in its understanding of how much oil was leaking?\xc2\xa0 At any point in the communication with BP, does the administration believe it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten willfully errant information?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to ask somebody at the Department of the Interior or Homeland Security if they felt otherwise.\xc2\xa0 Major, our focus has been throughout this process to plan for the very worst and to ensure that our response flowed from what could be the very worst.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what has governed our actions since the night of the explosion when the Coast Guard came to the assistance of those that had been hurt and those that were missing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I ask, the boot on the throat metaphor indicates or suggests at least to those who might hear it for the first time that something went awry or has gone awry with the relationship, and the administration or the federal government needs to be much more forceful to force an intractable partner to do something they otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it suggests that the cooperation has broken down.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m just from a different part of the country.\xc2\xa0 Would \xe2\x80\x9chold your feet to the fire,\xe2\x80\x9d would that be something more that would be understandable to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking why that metaphor --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t wear my boots today, right?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, holding your feet to the fire could create some pain, Chip -- again, I -- maybe you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t go camping either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The law creates this sort of partnership that\xe2\x80\x99s being worked out for the first time in real time where the industry --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is the first time that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of this magnitude.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so not the first time, but the first time -- right -- of this magnitude.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t phrase it any differently than the President has over the past many days, which is it is our obligation to ensure that the responsible party is doing everything within their power to cap the well; to respond to the pollution that has -- that is on top of the water; to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that is necessary to ensure that we mitigate its spread, and where it does spread and interrupt economic activities for local communities, that that\xe2\x80\x99s being dealt with.\xc2\xa0 I think those are all -- that is the full range of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re supervising.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For those who wonder and ask the question, what was the time lapse for the designation of an incident of national significance?\xc2\xa0 Can you walk us through that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because when I talked to Thad Allen on Friday, he said you really have to look at this as two calendar events -- the explosion, the search and rescue, putting out the fire; then a catastrophic leak.\xc2\xa0 He said you really need to measure these as sort of two separate instances of intervention at the federal level and with BP.\xc2\xa0 Do you view the calendar that way, and that day one is when the leak became the top priority after dealing with the explosion and the search and rescue and everything else?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost -- again, first and foremost, the Coast Guard arrived on the scene I think with four vessels over the course of some period of time after the explosion -- I think that happened at roughly 10:30 p.m. that night -- to assist in the fire that was ongoing and to ensure that all that could be was being done to get folks that were injured off, and to look for those that were missing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think pretty quickly after that, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that there is, for whatever reason, oil in the water.\xc2\xa0 The response -- I think there were -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go back and look at my notes -- I think there were some 70 vessels in the water, there were scores of planes in the air, dealing with this even at that point of designating it a spill of national significance.\xc2\xa0 This is a response that has been ongoing since the report of that explosion some many days ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize what happened in Times Square?\xc2\xa0 Was that an act of terrorism?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think anybody that has the type of material that they had in a car in Times Square, I would say that that was intended to terrorize, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that whoever did that would be categorized as a terrorist, yes.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the speech at the U.N. today, does it in any way lead the administration to say, okay, the door is now closed?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to come to your -- to live up to your obligations is the formulation from this podium and elsewhere -- does it do anything to narrow the ability of this administration to wonder aloud if Iran is going to do anything different?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the likely -- I would say this.\xc2\xa0 The offer is still there.\xc2\xa0 The likelihood that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take that offer and walk through the door seems -- they seem, and I think through their words and their actions, unwilling to live up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dual-track approach going to ensure that if they fail to live up to those obligations, that we take those next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to immigration --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the immigration protests all over the country this weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President for quite some time, dating back to his membership in the Senate, is somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s pushed for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I think regardless of what side of the political argument you\xe2\x80\x99re on, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that what has happened in Arizona leads you to understand that this town has to act on something that\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive, lest we have an immigration policy through -- by 50 states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The timing will depend, I think, quite frankly, Major, on willingness from individuals in both parties to step up and meet those obligations.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How intensively is the President monitoring the Greek debt crisis, and what does he think the long delay in the Europeans getting together to actually do something about this says about their cohesion?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me point you to Treasury for the response to the latter.\xc2\xa0 The President has gotten updates throughout this process on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 Time has been taken in the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic briefings that happen most days to go through -- that go through what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he worry that it will have an effect on U.S. recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly talked about the notion that -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99re happy with the steps that Greece says they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take and happy with the response.\xc2\xa0 Obviously anything -- we are greatly concerned about anything throughout the world that could cause a disruption in the continuing recovery of the global economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that the NEC, the CEA, and the Treasury have looked at throughout this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only two questions, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s early in the week, Lester, but I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 In view of President Franklin Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s 998 press conferences, why has President Obama held not a single White House press conference since last July?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, what would you -- let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you just -- I just have one question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can ask me as many as you wish.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to use one.\xc2\xa0 When the President took eight questions from members of the White House press corps at the Nuclear Security Summit at the Washington Convention Center, what would you call that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was not a press conference.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What would you call it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a select few.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A select few what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A select few reporters.\xc2\xa0 It was not a White House press conference.\xc2\xa0 That was my question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, can I ask another question?\xc2\xa0 I do want to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course you can.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to -- can I take Chip\xe2\x80\x99s thing and just ask one more?\xc2\xa0 What differently do you think the President would have done at the Nuclear Security Summit in taking the eight questions from members of the White House press corps that might have denoted -- might have tripped your definition of a press conference?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be a wonderful thing if he had allowed all reporters -- just it would be wonderful if you would allow these front-rowers two questions and then go all the way back to the back and then come back and let them start again.\xc2\xa0 That would be fair.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter and applause.)\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, you\xe2\x80\x99re a happy occupant of the front row today and I hope that you will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the front row, it\xe2\x80\x99s the second row.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Front rows today -- pardon me.\xc2\xa0 I hope that you\xe2\x80\x99ll take the opportunity to speak with each one of these members individually.\xc2\xa0 Now, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I hope you didn\xe2\x80\x99t dodge my second question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I try not to dodge.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out -- the President answered eight questions from the White House press corps.\xc2\xa0 Unclear -- I will admit --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But only eight of them -- only eight selected.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so how many unselected would it have checked your box as to being a White House press conference?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that if he wanted a press conference, he would have invited all of us, not just a select few, which he does so often.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- were you at the event?\xc2\xa0 Did you apply for credentials to come to the event?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would be delighted if I thought there was any chance.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but I asked you, did you apply for credentials to come to the event?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I did not.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So you were offered the opportunity but declined to do so?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw the hall that we were in -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot bigger than where we are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot bigger than the East Room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you only had eight.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There were a whole lot of people there.\xc2\xa0 Again, I just -- can you give me a number?\xc2\xa0 Is it a number thing that would -- you think if we would have -- if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t eight, it maybe was like nine?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s 47 that are here today.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So 47 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sitting, and eight more standing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, so 47 and 8 is 55.\xc2\xa0 So the President would have taken -- if the President took 55 questions, would that have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Kennedy took 20 -- no, 38 questions in his first press conference.\xc2\xa0 You remember that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not 55 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not eight, it\xe2\x80\x99s not 55, it\xe2\x80\x99s 38?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go to my second question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get an answer to my second question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I suddenly have found this to be wildly amusing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re an enormously amusing man.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And inexplicably, I\xe2\x80\x99m finding this to be equally amusing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to -- just help me out, Lester, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve now established that 55 is probably a lot, right?\xc2\xa0 Thirty-eight you said Kennedy took -- so that could be an early entrant for the number of questions in which it is possible for the event to be designated a press conference.\xc2\xa0 Eight appears on your measure to be too small.\xc2\xa0 Are you comfortable with somewhere between eight and 38?\xc2\xa0 Or do you want to -- is there a more specific number that you want to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that 90 -- that 90 reporters usually come to those --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So we got a 90.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s -- apparently 55 seems to be quite in the middle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s 60, the number we need to end this filibuster.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he could give shorter answers and only recognize them for two --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s move on.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s move on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he\xe2\x80\x99d get through a lot.\xc2\xa0 But I want to ask my second question, if I may.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, will the transcript please -- just you can just put this in parentheses --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- more questions --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, hold on, Goyal.\xc2\xa0 I\'m -- this is my press conference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Can you just put in parentheses that it appeared as Lester didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my second question, but we had like 90, 55, 38 and eight to the -- now, I will -- just for a point of personal privilege, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear as if Lester\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the President ever having participated in a White House news conference would have been the case because I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has ever taken 38 questions at one event.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Lester.\xc2\xa0 Your second?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the last one.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to how Mexico treats illegal aliens from Central America as detailed by syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean they\xe2\x80\x99re very tough in enforcing that border.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will take a look at that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Times Square incident, is this like the incident on Christmas Day in that it was a missed -- it was a near-miss? Remember how angry the President was on screening for the flight that came into Chicago on Christmas Day?\xc2\xa0 Does this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Detroit --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does this incident represent in Times Square on Saturday night represent an incident where they just lucked out and a terrorist incident didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President and the mayor have both mentioned that as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard for many years, if people see suspicious activity to quickly alert the authorities.\xc2\xa0 The President -- Bill handed me a note that the President spoke with Duane Jackson to commend and thank him for his vigilance in alerting authorities -- and for those authorities acting quickly to prevent anything from becoming -- anything from happening as a result of what was placed in that car.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The police have apparently now questioned the original owner of this car.\xc2\xa0 And it appears that it was sold without any paperwork in Connecticut I think last month.\xc2\xa0 Does that kind of information reach the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything more you can tell us about the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 That was some of the updates that John provides the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you all have pointed to the meeting the President had in the Oval Office on the day that the rig sank, and there were a lot of people there -- Napolitano, Salazar, the FEMA boss, Admiral Allen.\xc2\xa0 How unusual is that kind of meeting?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some context of how high on the radar screen that something gets when you have that many folks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously that was -- obviously, leaving aside sort of where we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from the 22nd, obviously a rig of that size, an explosion, 11 people dead, that sinking into the Gulf is something of great importance.\xc2\xa0 And the best way -- I think the President would believe, and I think many people would believe -- the best way to get the most up-to-date information as to what everybody is doing in real time is to do something like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement though -- later today, the President is going to speak with the governors of Tennessee and California about the flooding -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- Tennessee and Kentucky -- about the flooding that\xe2\x80\x99s going on there.\xc2\xa0 And I think our FEMA Director is headed to that region later today.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a large meeting or it could be just a discussion with each of the governors to get what\xe2\x80\x99s going on on the ground, I think that provides the President and the team with a lot of information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yesterday was a good -- when we got to the command center in Venice, you had representatives from -- you had the governor, the lieutenant governor, the parish president, the Coast Guard, the EPA, all giving input into what was going on, what they wanted to see happen differently, along with senior staff members from here at the White House that can work out any kinks in the command chain.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there are reports today that the chairman of the FCC is leaning towards abandoning his push for rules that would ensure what some call net neutrality, something that would obviously be a big blow to public interest groups, as well as many supporters of the President.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get an update on where that is without going off of what may or may not happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was New Jersey canceled?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We discussed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) -- (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what George meant.\xc2\xa0 But we discussed travel for the next few days; on Friday, thought that moving -- obviously, when he goes there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of assets that need to be moved.\xc2\xa0 Those assets were moved in order to support our trip to the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to going back, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sheila Bair has been urging lawmakers to scrap this plan for a derivative regulation, saying it will destabilize banks and also drive risks to other parts of the financial sector.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw the article.\xc2\xa0 I have not talked with folks in the administration.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, what was contained in the President\xe2\x80\x99s original -- in the original plan was to ensure that derivatives were -- these were activities that were moved out of the dark and onto regulated exchanges.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that that is a strong route to go to ensure that what is happening is regulated.\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken specifically as to what Sheila Bair had to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe the chain of command on a minute-to-minute or a day-to-day basis in terms of the cleanup and trying to staunch the flow of the oil leak?\xc2\xa0 In other words, does Admiral Allen tell BP, okay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got X number of submersibles; we want them down there doing this, that, or the other thing?\xc2\xa0 As BP endeavors to create this cofferdam, is the United States giving advice on the design of the cofferdam, resources or facilities to build the cofferdam?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- on the cofferdam, let me get some information from the Joint Information Center.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, this is a response that touches on a lot of different departments, right?\xc2\xa0 The Department of Interior -- Minerals Management has purview over drilling; DHS over incidents; when pollutants hit the land it becomes EPA.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Thad Allen, as a result of the declaration, is the National Incident Commander and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the federal government.\xc2\xa0 All those entities together, regardless of their distinctions and what their jurisdictions are, who is calling the shots in terms of the deployment of the resources and the technology of -- the government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have submersibles, BP has the submersible.\xc2\xa0 So does any one -- or any one of those agencies dictate when that submersible goes down, what it does down there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those submersibles by BP have been in the water, the robotics -- look, they\xe2\x80\x99re doing what they can do safely at the site in order to try to fix the valves, to get as accurate a picture as they can of what is happening underwater.\xc2\xa0 You see -- and I think some pretty specific diagrams and explanations of where these breaches are, which is governing the engineering of the instrumentation to put on top of that leak.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- today we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Interior, Homeland Security, and EPA -- Thad Allen is not at that meeting, had to -- was doing something else at that time -- but all these people are ensuring that BP is doing what they need to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what kind of discussions have there been between this administration and the British government in terms of the spill?\xc2\xa0 Any at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know off the top of my head.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on that and also on Israel.\xc2\xa0 On the British government, if BP defaults or goes bankrupt, does the British government have any obligation to help pay this huge, multibillion debt?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a legal question that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you look into that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will certainly look into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Israel, did you get into specific topics -- settlements, Jerusalem, and so forth?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing more than the readout that I have here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last Friday, Senator Bill Nelson said that a energy legislation that included a component of offshore drilling would be dead on arrival.\xc2\xa0 Lindsey Graham today says, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had problems with car design, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t stop driving, as a way to suggest that you continue the offshore drilling.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint of this evolved since last week when you said it would affect possibly the plans, but you weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to talk about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam, the President was specific in ordering Secretary Salazar to look at all the possible aspects of what could or did go wrong in this instance, to report back to him in that 30-day period -- after that 30-day period of time, and that this is an administration that is going to take whatever information we get from that and have that dictate our decision-making going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it would be premature to get too far ahead of where Secretary Salazar\xe2\x80\x99s investigation is, even as our priority, Sam, is to plug the leak in the floor of the ocean, deal with the spread of the oil on the surface, to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that is possible to prevent environmental and economic damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten enough information to fully rule out further offshore drilling and amend your legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The investigation, Sam, is to determine what happened and to use that information going forward to dictate any changes in our policy -- understanding this, Sam, that -- I forget the number of active wells that are currently in the Gulf. I mean, the Gulf is -- this area of the Gulf was, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, largely unaffected by the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement on the Outer Continental Shelf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if what you -- if your question was to ask how this affects the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, or how does this affect any drilling that\xe2\x80\x99s done in the Outer Continental Shelf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to know how it affects the administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for offshore drilling --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to what Secretary Salazar will ultimately report to the President.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your openness, Robert.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:58 P.M.
