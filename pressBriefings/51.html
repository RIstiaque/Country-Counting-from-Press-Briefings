Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:10 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I do have a quick statement at the top before we get to questions. \xc2\xa0As I\'m sure you are aware, today Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are doing their jobs and fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities by reviewing Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s questionnaire and holding a public meeting to learn more about this highly qualified nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the individuals they have invited to the Senate today to speak in support of Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s character and credentials is a man named Timothy Lewis.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Lewis is a retired former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.\xc2\xa0 In his written remarks, Judge Lewis noted, \xe2\x80\x9cFor anyone who questions, as most Americans do, the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to the United States Supreme Court, I am living proof that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 As Judge Lewis notes, he was nominated in the fall of 1992, weeks before a presidential election.\xc2\xa0 He was nominated by a Republican President to serve on the Court of Appeals.\xc2\xa0 He had a hearing before a Democratic-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee and was unanimously confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate on October 8th, just three weeks before the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s one way in which his testimony today is interesting.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a second.\xc2\xa0 Later in his career, Judge Lewis returned to Congress to testify on behalf of his 3rd Circuit colleague, Sam Alito.\xc2\xa0 At the time, Judge Lewis noted that he did not share Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconservative ideology,\xe2\x80\x9d but that he \xe2\x80\x9cfound him to be a good person and a fine judge, intellectually honest, highly principled, and well qualified to serve on the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing Judge Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that day, Senator Grassley noted that he found Judge Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s testimony on behalf of then-Judge Alito \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly compelling.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So today, we hope that Senator Grassley will be similarly compelled by Judge Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 Otherwise, Senator Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s continued obstruction amounts to what former Judge Lewis today called \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous political gamesmanship rooted in an unfortunate ideological fervor that ultimately harms each branch of government and dilutes the effectiveness and capacity of the judiciary.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo before today I had not had the pleasure of ever having heard of Judge Lewis, but presumably all of you have.\xc2\xa0 But obviously he has some interesting things to say and he comes to this issue from a unique perspective.\xc2\xa0 So I commend his testimony to your attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all that, we\'ll go straight to the birthday boy.\xc2\xa0 Josh, you can begin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 It seems like you were having fun with that last windup.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I enjoyed reading about Judge Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with Senator Pat Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the confirmation of Eric Fanning --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 We last discussed him when he was crumbling the Gitmo paper in his hands and filming himself throwing it into a wastebasket.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he essentially suggested that there was a quid pro quo between him and the Defense Department that he agreed to lift this hold because he was told by Deputy Defense Secretary Work that the clock had run out on transferring people to Leavenworth or really to the mainland.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Deputy Defense Secretary has put out his own statement despite this, but one thing he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address in that statement is the specific language that Senator Roberts brought up about the clock has run out on being able to do this in the time that\'s left in this administration.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m wondering if you can -- is the White House disputing Senator Roberts\xe2\x80\x99s account of what he was told by the Defense Department about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into any -- I don\'t have any insight to share about private conversations between Senator Roberts and the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 The good news is -- I\'m sorry -- the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 The good news is that the Department of Defense has explained exactly what was communicated to Senator Roberts.\xc2\xa0 They were involved in those discussions, and they can make clear exactly what was communicated to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe thing that I can just confirm for you is that nothing about the administration\'s position, with regard to the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, has changed.\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that the most effective way to close the prison is to transfer all those individuals that can be safely transferred.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with our partners all around the world to do that in a way that is consistent with our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we also believe that it\'s possible to transfer the remaining detainees at the prison at Guantanamo Bay to the United States to secure facilities where those detainees can be held without posing a threat to our national security.\xc2\xa0 After all -- and Senator Roberts knows this quite well -- that there are dangerous, convicted, hardened terrorists serving time on American soil, in American prisons, right now.\xc2\xa0 That does not pose a threat to our national security.\xc2\xa0 In fact, detaining them, having brought them to justice through our Article III courts, actually makes our country safer.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our argument on this is quite clear.\xc2\xa0 This is an argument that has strong bipartisan support among national security experts.\xc2\xa0 President Bush agreed with this position.\xc2\xa0 Both Colin Powell, General David Petraeus have also articulated their strong support for the priority that should be placed on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay explicitly for national security reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the elephant in the room here is that even if Congress were to see the light, in your view, and embrace what you\'ve described as the most effective, direct way to close the prison by lifting these restrictions, that would be effective at the start of the new fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 So you basically have October, November, December and part of January to select a location, prepare a location, transfer dozens of detainees from Gitmo to the United States, and then close the prison.\xc2\xa0 So are you able to acknowledge at this point that even if President Obama is able to order the closure of Guantanamo Bay, that he won\'t be able to actually, because of these logistical constraints, close it by the time he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been presented with that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to believe that it is possible and, in fact, should be a priority of the United States government to succeed in closing that prison.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama vowed to do it as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 He did that on I believe it was his second or third full day in office.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to strongly believe that that should be a priority and that that would be possible if our efforts to achieve this goal were not being thwarted by obstructionists in the United States Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you about this dispute within the Democratic Party primary and some of the comments from Senator Sanders just in the last day, saying, in light of what happened in Nevada, the Democratic Party basically has a choice.\xc2\xa0 It can open its doors, bring people in, or it can choose to be -- its status-quo structure remain dependent on big-money contributions and be a party with limited energy.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you feel that, after seven and a half years of the Democratic Party being under the leadership of President Obama, if that\'s an accurate description of the way the party stands.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make a couple of observations.\xc2\xa0 The first is that I do feel confident -- though I did not specifically do this myself -- that if you were to Google news coverage from May 18th, 2008, the tenor of the coverage would be quite similar to the tenor of the coverage today.\xc2\xa0 There would be all kinds of hand-wringing among party activists about whether or not the party would come together after a divisive primary between Senator Obama and Senator Clinton.\xc2\xa0 There would be pundits with decades of electoral experience posing difficult questions about whether or not it is even possible given the passion of Clinton supporters for even somebody with all the skills of Senator Obama to unite the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 There would be Republicans salivating at the prospect of a divided Democratic Party limping into a general election, giving an advantage to the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess the point is that we\'ve seen a lot of this before.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not to diminish anybody\'s candidacy.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not to diminish the passion and commitment of supporters for either candidate.\xc2\xa0 But it is an indication that the Democratic Party in a general election will be focused on a different question.\xc2\xa0 Americans across the country will be focused on a very clear choice that they\'ll have in a general election, and there will be ample time over the next six or seven months for candidates on either side to make their case.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama will certainly be weighing in to make his case.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of that will serve to motivate the American people to engage in this debate and to participate in the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama and others will certainly be making that case.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have too many doubts about the intensity of the debate that is likely to ensue or the degree to which voters on both sides and both parties will be highly motivated to participate.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a good thing for our democracy.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama had an opportunity to speak about this at the commencement ceremony at Rutgers University over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that our electorate gets more engaged in these kinds of political debates is good for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The primaries are always hard-fought, I think we acknowledge.\xc2\xa0 But this seems to be a different flavor here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve got allegations of violence, of disenfranchisement; the DNC Chairwoman saying one of the candidate\'s campaigns is doing insufficient to address that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel no obligation at this point to mediate or to try and resolve some of this?\xc2\xa0 He\'s basically just going to wait until the candidates do that amongst themselves to get involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Josh, that we have seen that the party primaries typically are, particularly ones that are contested as passionately as this one has been.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be strong feelings on both sides.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think one of the lessons of the election in 2008 is not to confuse the passion in the primary for disinterest in the general election.\xc2\xa0 I think, if anything, the reason that people are so passionate about the current primary process is they understand the stakes in the general election.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly was true in 2008.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it\xe2\x80\x99s true in 2016.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in the general election will be useful in sharpening up that case and he certainly looks forward to the opportunity to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I also think that President Obama benefits from his own personal involvement in the last hotly contested Democratic presidential primary; that yes, the issues are a little different and the debates are always a little bit different but no less intense.\xc2\xa0 They certainly were intense, particularly in this period, in May of 2008.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s probably an interesting story to be written there about sort of where things were at this stage eight years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Donald Trump said yesterday in an interview with Reuters that he would be willing to talk to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s leader, and that if he were successful in winning the White House, that he would renegotiate the Paris climate deal.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to the first?\xc2\xa0 And on the second, should U.S. allies be concerned that the Paris deal is not as strong or as bulletproof as the President did say when he helped to create it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the question related to North Korea, the President has been -- has had a number of opportunities recently to make clear exactly what our position is there.\xc2\xa0 The United States has worked effectively with the international community, including countries like Russia and China, to isolate North Korea because of their failure to abide by their international obligations when it comes to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And we have succeeded in ramping up that pressure and ramping up that isolation.\xc2\xa0 It has not yet had the desired effect on the North Korean regime, but there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate that they are feeling that pressure.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have said is that that pressure can be relieved and the international community is prepared to engage with North Korea as soon as they make clear their commitment to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and ending the kind of provocative rhetoric and acts that are so destabilizing to the broader region.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about what the path out of this isolation is for the North Korean government.\xc2\xa0 Thus far, they have declined to pursue it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the strategy that we have laid out and it is a strategy that is consistent with the joint pursuit of our interests in that region of the world, where the United States stands by our allies in South Korea and stands by our allies in Japan and coordinates with China and Russia in pursuit of this goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the Paris climate agreement, I would just note that it\xe2\x80\x99s more than 190 countries who signed on to this agreement, and each of them made specific commitments with regard to how they would reduce carbon pollution in their countries.\xc2\xa0 This is an agreement that took years to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 It is an agreement that was only possible because of the leadership of the United States -- this is something that Prime Minister Cameron mentioned at the news conference that he did with President Obama in London a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis agreement was catalyzed when President Obama announced alongside President Xi in China that both China and the United States were prepared to make commitments to cut carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 The Republican talking point for years had been that it was folly for the United States to pursue an international climate agreement and to cut carbon pollution in the United States knowing that China was going to only pollute more.\xc2\xa0 The truth is because of principled, effective diplomacy and the leadership of President Obama, we did reach an agreement where China agreed to cap their emissions and begin to bring them down.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s significant about that is not just the positive impact we anticipate that that will have on the climate and the positive impact it had on diplomacy in terms of bringing other countries to the table, it\xe2\x80\x99s also going to have a positive impact on the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 We already know that Westinghouse, a fine American business, has committed to building four nuclear plants in China.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good indication of -- a pretty clear example of how the world\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to a low-carbon future has a positive economic impact in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The same is true of other countries -- I mean of other U.S. companies like General Electric that now have essentially a global market for renewable energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs other countries have made a commitment to cutting their carbon pollution, they have to look to renewable energy to power their economy.\xc2\xa0 And the United States -- in part because of some of the historic investments that were made in this sector of the economy under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, the United States is the leading edge of that industry.\xc2\xa0 And a global commitment on the part of nations around the world to considering sources of renewable energy only creates good economic opportunities for American businesses and American workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the completion of the Paris agreement is a testament to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, the effectiveness of diplomacy, the positive impact it will have on the climate and the positive impact it will have on the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to circle back to my questions, is the White House concerned that U.S. allies may view comments like this as a sign that this agreement is not as robust as the President said when he signed it?\xc2\xa0 And on the North Korea topic --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just do that one first.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s losing sleep here at the White House about that.\xc2\xa0 So, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a source of concern.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on North Korea, the President, when he was a candidate in 2008, also suggested that he would talk to U.S. enemies.\xc2\xa0 Does he consider it responsible or irresponsible for Donald Trump to be suggesting that about Kim Jong-un?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to weigh in at this point on the pronouncements or rhetoric of any of the candidates, particularly with regard to an issue like North Korea.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly have made clear what our approach to that situation is, and it is rooted in the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to working closely with our allies and partners around the world to ramp up pressure on countries like North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tI should also note that President Obama, over the last several years, has also deployed additional military assets to the Asia Pacific region, some of them oriented specifically to counter North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s missile program.\xc2\xa0 And because of those investments and because of those strategic decisions that the President made in close consultation with our military leaders, believes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got sufficient protections in place.\xc2\xa0 But that certainly has not dampened our desire to work effectively with the international community to ramp up pressure on the North Koreans to get them to change course.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly, on one other topic.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President was unveiling the overtime -- details of the overtime rules that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been expecting for some time.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House confident that these will stand up to legal challenges from Republicans in the business community?\xc2\xa0 And are you confident that they will stay in place if a Republican -- Donald Trump, in this case -- wins the White House in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the short answer to your question is yes.\xc2\xa0 I will elaborate on it briefly.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to sort of the legal questions, this is actually not the creation of a new rule.\xc2\xa0 This is a rule that has been on the books governing overtime pay for decades now.\xc2\xa0 So this is merely an update of an already-existing rule that will ensure that the hardest-working Americans are paid fairly for their overtime.\xc2\xa0 So the principle is quite simple.\xc2\xa0 The impact is quite significant.\xc2\xa0 We would anticipate that this executive action that would extend overtime protections to more than 4 million American workers -- again, by definition, these are 4 million of the hardest-working Americans.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who are already working overtime.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that they should be paid fairly for their work.\xc2\xa0 And the economic impact is also significant.\xc2\xa0 The economic impact, according to our estimates, is that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 wages would increase by $12 billion over the next 10 years as a result of this rule.\xc2\xa0 So this an impactful way for us to ensure that American workers are paid fairly, and to do something that many people have identified as an important goal, which is to put upward pressure on wages.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve seen strong economic growth in this country.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen strong trends related to job creation.\xc2\xa0 But we haven\'t seen as much progress made on increasing wages in this country.\xc2\xa0 And this is a tangible example of how we can do that.\xc2\xa0 And by the way, by definition, this is increasing wages for people who make $47,000 or less.\xc2\xa0 So this is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy that our economy is going to be strongest when we\'re growing from the middle out and we\'re looking for opportunities to expand economic opportunity for middle-class families and those families that are working hard to get to the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is, can they withstand legal challenges?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they can withstand legal challenges.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s not a new rule.\xc2\xa0 This is a rule that\'s been on the books for a long time.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just merely updated with new standards.\xc2\xa0 And the next President will have to make their own choices with regard to the way that they choose to use executive action.\xc2\xa0 That\'s true on a whole range of things.\xc2\xa0 But the legal foundation for making this argument is solid.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to start with Zika.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Senate did not pass the President\xe2\x80\x99s $1.9 billion request but did pass the $1.1 billion package.\xc2\xa0 Stipulating everything that you\'ve said many times before about public health experts wanting the full $1.9 billion, is the package that passed the Senate something that you guys would be willing to accept?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion package.\xc2\xa0 And we were pleased to see that that proposal, while it did not pass, did garner some important bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 So Republicans like Marco Rubio and even Bill Cassidy from Louisiana -- two states that are on the Gulf Coast that I think are legitimately concerned about the potential impact of the Zika virus on the populations in those two states -- supported the $1.9 billion package.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Senator Rubio, I think, said it in a way that I would strongly agree with for a change.\xc2\xa0 He said, yes, the proposal came from the White House.\xc2\xa0 But \xe2\x80\x9cit\'s really the scientists\xe2\x80\x99 request, the doctors\xe2\x80\x99 request, the public health sector\xe2\x80\x99s request for how to address this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward this proposal, but he did so based on the specific advice that he has received from our public health professionals. And we\'re going to continue to urge Congress to consider fully funding the request that our public health professionals have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m no expert in math, but obviously the Senate proposal that was passed yesterday is larger than the House Republican proposal that\'s under consideration.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we\'ve seen just in the last couple of weeks important progress in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 For a while we saw Republicans on Capitol Hill basically rejecting the need for this kind of funding, but now we\'ve seen bipartisan legislation move through the Senate that would fund our efforts for more than a billion dollars.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo obviously that\'s good progress, but it falls short of what our public health professionals believe is necessary.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to advocate for what our public health professionals believe is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that you would veto the House bill, and so I\'m wondering, I guess, does that veto threat stand for anything less than the $1.9 billion?\xc2\xa0 Or is the $1.1 billion something that -- not exactly everything you want, but you\'re willing to take it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re going to continue to advocate for the $1.9 billion.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have a veto threat to issue on the $1.1 billion.\xc2\xa0 Our concerns about the Republican proposal in the House are many.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just that they are about $1.3 billion short of what our experts say is necessary.\xc2\xa0 It also demands that that emergency funding be paid for by gutting investments in protecting the American people from the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 So the approach that Republicans have advocated for in the House is wrong, it\'s unwise, and it is inconsistent with prioritizing the public health and wellbeing of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Libya, I\'m wondering if you have a timeline to share for the U.S. and its allies to secure the U.N. Security Council resolution that they want that would enable us to ship arms to the unity government there.\xc2\xa0 And also, I know that you talked a little bit about how it would be designed to keep arms out of the hands of people that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have them in the region, but I\'m wondering if you could just maybe talk more broadly about if there\'s any risk that an infusion of arms is going to heighten tension or kind of fuel additional conflict just by their mere presence there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of a timeline that has been set out for the passage of a resolution.\xc2\xa0 You can check with my colleagues in Ambassador Power\'s office.\xc2\xa0 They would have a better sense of the mechanics of all of this.\xc2\xa0 But the broader question is, what can the international community do to support the government of national accord in Libya in their efforts to secure the country and combat the ISIL presence that we know is there.\xc2\xa0 And how can we do all of that in a way that prevents the arms from falling into the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 Libya is a dangerous place, and there are a variety of factions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t shy about resorting to violence to try to get their way inside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 So the prospect of further militarizing the situation is a prospect that must be carefully considered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\'s also clear is that the government of national accord needs sufficient resources and equipment to get that situation under control.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s what our experts will be examining.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that they have to walk a fine line here, so it will be carefully considered.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is a timeline.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be any desire to rush it.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, further delays are only going to create more space for some of those armed factions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t shy about resorting to violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a difficult situation.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made tremendous progress, though, when you sort of consider where we were even three or four months ago.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of doubt about whether or not we were going to be able to bring about the kind of political consensus among a variety of opposition groups to even form a government.\xc2\xa0 But the U.N. did a lot of important work.\xc2\xa0 The United States played a leading role in facilitating these conversations and bringing the international community together behind them.\xc2\xa0 And we do now have a government of national accord, and that government of national accord now is in Tripoli.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ve made a lot of important progress that, frankly, a couple of months I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I even would have believed was possible.\xc2\xa0 And so we need to look for ways to keep that momentum going.\xc2\xa0 And one way to do that is to consider international support for their security efforts there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans are saying today that classified administration reports provided to Congress over the last three years show that the administration knowingly approved for the transfer of Gitmo detainees to countries that were incapable of preventing them from returning to terrorism, and argue that administration officials have given misleading testimony about that.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering how you respond to that sort of request from Republicans to correct the record on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the record is quite clear about what President Obama has worked to do.\xc2\xa0 When he took office in 2009, he instituted a new procedure for considering specific cases of individual Gitmo detainees.\xc2\xa0 And that process included a review of individual case files to determine the best way to dispose of those cases.\xc2\xa0 And what the idea has been is that, by carefully reviewing the individual cases, we can design the most effective way to prevent them from posing a threat to the United States or our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this has been a rigorous process and it\'s been meticulous, and you\'ll recall that early in 2009 and 2010, it took a while to stand this process up and to move through all of the applications.\xc2\xa0 But that process has paid significant dividends for our national security because it has allowed us to succeed in transferring 144 individuals since January of 2009.\xc2\xa0 And what we know is that less than 5 percent of them, of those individuals, have been confirmed as reengaging in the fight; 95 percent of them aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s an indication of the ability that the United States has to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay in a way that mitigates the risk that is posed to the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a process that is rigorous, that sometimes is not just exhaustive, but exhausting, but it has demonstrated a track record of success.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that we would be even more successful if Congress weren\xe2\x80\x99t time and time again trying to throw sand in the gears of the process in a way that has only slowed down our efforts and made our efforts more difficult.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But our track record here is solid and it is one that the President is proud of.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one that has bipartisan support in terms of pursuing a goal that Democrats and Republicans share, and that is the need to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 This is often shaped up as a fight between Democrats and Republicans, or Republicans on Capitol Hill in a Democratic administration.\xc2\xa0 The truth is, the Republican administration supported closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I did have a chance to take a look at the statement from the Speaker\'s office today, and there was a suggestion somehow that the Obama administration was prioritizing politics in this situation.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s pretty rich.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that General David Petraeus is prioritizing politics when he says we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that General Colin Powell is prioritizing politics when he suggests that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Senator McCain is playing politics when he suggests that we should close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Senator Graham of South Carolina is playing politics when suggests that we close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Senator Collins is playing politics when she says that it would be a good idea to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou know who is playing politics with this?\xc2\xa0 The RNC, who says that they actually want to run ads against Democrats all across the country for wanting to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we know what\'s going on here.\xc2\xa0 And you have congressional Republicans that are cynically playing politics and playing on the fears of the American people in order to score some cheap political points.\xc2\xa0 The truth is, the American people would be safer if we succeeded in closing the prison.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not just my assessment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the assessment of the United States Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the assessment of the United States intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the assessment of Democratic and Republican national security experts that for years have disagree with the approach of this Congress to prevent the closure of the prison.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz filing a censure resolution against the IRS Commissioner today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I saw that specific news.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our views of the work of the IRS Commissioner are quite different than the views of congressional Republicans.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that John Koskinen has assumed a very difficult task.\xc2\xa0 And that task has been made only more difficult by the false accusations of Republicans and by the continued insistence of Republicans to cut the budget for the IRS.\xc2\xa0 So we know that over the last five years or so -- yes, over the last five years that Congress has cut the IRS budget by a billion dollars.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen wait times for customer service increase.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s had a not positive impact on enforcement.\xc2\xa0 And then to have Republicans come back and say that he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing a very good job, it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the level.\xc2\xa0 And if they spent half as much time trying to make sure that the IRS got the money that they needed to do their job as they do undermining the commissioner of the IRS, the American people would be better served.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow up on the President\xe2\x80\x99s lunch yesterday with Jack Ma, can you give us any more details on what the two men talked about over lunch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of the lunch.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, the President appeared at a forum in Malaysia with Mr. Ma around the APEC Summit, and after the forum, the President had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Ma and invited him to come to lunch at the White House next time he was in the area.\xc2\xa0 So this is just a follow-up on that public discussion that they had had.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously they\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- as they discussed in the public forum, there are a number of common interests that they have, particularly as they relate to climate change and the international economy.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that is of interest to President Obama and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he was interested to have lunch with him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the richest man in Asia, and so I think a lot of us were wondering why that meeting wasn\xe2\x80\x99t put on the President\xe2\x80\x99s public schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it was a private lunch.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for the President to have a private lunch with people that you might find notable.\xc2\xa0 But obviously those are disclosed on the WAVES lists that are released regularly.\xc2\xa0 That is a transparency step that no previous President has agreed to, and, in fact, the previous administration went to the Supreme Court to try to prevent the release of those lists.\xc2\xa0 So I think our approach to transparency here is well-documented.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to just ask you about the raids that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing are going to be coming in the next few weeks and months on the Central American migrants who have crossed the southern border.\xc2\xa0 Quite a few immigration advocates as well as some Democratic members of Congress have expressed very deep concerns that some of the people affected here are women and children, many of them who are not afforded due process in these immigration proceedings when they cross the border but are being sent back to very dangerous conditions.\xc2\xa0 One of them said today that the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to conduct these raids and use this approach to these people was nothing more than a callous political calculation with real and grave humanitarian consequences.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s your response, first of all, to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to correct so many misconceptions.\xc2\xa0 The first is what the Department of Homeland Security has indicated is that the current operations are a continuation of operations that were announced back in January and in March.\xc2\xa0 And these operations are being conducted consistent with the enforcement priorities that President Obama and Secretary Johnson laid out back in the fall of 2014.\xc2\xa0 That is these operations are focused on convicted criminals and others who could pose a risk to local communities.\xc2\xa0 The other enforcement priority are individuals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously described as recent border-crossers -- individuals who have been apprehended crossing the border illegally since January 1st of 2014.\xc2\xa0 Those are our enforcement priorities and these operations are being conducted consistent with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in addition to that, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the only criteria.\xc2\xa0 Operations are only being conducted to enforce orders from immigration courts.\xc2\xa0 So only individuals who have been given an order of removal are subject to these operations, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that these operations are only conducted after all pending claims for asylum or humanitarian relief have been exhausted.\xc2\xa0 There is a firm commitment to due process and that\xe2\x80\x99s just an important principle of living in the United States of America, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one that this government is committed to.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing -- I guess the other one that I -- the other piece of information that I feel is important to share with you is that there is existing guidance that the DHS officers follow that avoids carrying out these operations in sensitive locations like schools or hospitals or places of worship.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true, though, is this is a nation of laws and we have to enforce the laws.\xc2\xa0 We can do all of that consistent with due process, but I would also readily acknowledge that this whole process would be far more effective if Congress had followed through on comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 There is no argument there.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to make that case that that\xe2\x80\x99s something Congress should do and it\xe2\x80\x99s why it is congressional Republicans who are ultimately responsible, because they were the ones who prevented House consideration of bipartisan legislation that had already passed the Senate that we know would have passed the House if a vote had been held.\xc2\xa0 But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the administration is committed to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 The side benefit here is also this should send a pretty clear signal to everyone, particularly individuals who are considering having their children smuggled into the country, that that\xe2\x80\x99s</p>\n<p>\n\ta really bad idea.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a dangerous journey.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s all kinds of evidence to indicate that these human traffickers have bad intentions and subject people who have paid them to horrible dangers, that those who are trafficked end up often being victimized themselves.\xc2\xa0 So this should send a very clear signal to everybody who might be contemplating this that the pitch being peddled by human traffickers that they can get their child into the United States and their child would be allowed to stay is false.\xc2\xa0 That is not an available option.\xc2\xa0 And given the dangers in making that journey, it is not something that parents should even consider for their kids.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is a principle that is rooted in a desire to try to protect people in other countries who are in a pretty desperate situation.\xc2\xa0 And there are a host of other investments that our country is committed to making in places like Honduras and El Salvador to try to address the root causes of this migration that we\'ve seen over the last couple of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President regard these people primarily as economic migrants, or as refugees?\xc2\xa0 Because if the President regards them as refugees, the deterrence message that you just recited that is clearly the intent of some of the enforcement actions doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to apply.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the intent is to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 That is the primary intent.\xc2\xa0 But, again, for those who may be considering entrusting themselves or the care of their children to human traffickers, this should be a very clear signal that the sales pitch from the human traffickers is a false one and it gives false hope to people who are in a desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the administration has sought to do is to address some of the root causes of migration.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a $700 million investment that was appropriated by Congress a year or two ago that is being used to invest in the security situation in those countries.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also being used to invest in economic development efforts in those countries to try to address some of those root causes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s also been a discussion that has been initiated by the State Department, working with the U.N., to try to establish a process where people with legitimate refugee claims can make them not in the United States or at the U.S. border, but rather in their home countries.\xc2\xa0 That is another way that we can give people access to refugee protection without having to embark on a dangerous journey.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re thinking about this creatively in a lot of ways.\xc2\xa0 But there is a principle that\'s at play here about enforcing the law, and it\'s one that the administration takes quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s call for European countries to take in the flood of Syrian refugees that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing at their borders?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'re talking about refugees staying in their countries and going through the proceedings there instead of coming here.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen the President speak pretty strongly about how it\'s the obligation of countries who are facing inflows like this to accept people who need to resettle.\xc2\xa0 So how is that consistent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I think it\'s difficult to compare these situations.\xc2\xa0 But I think the situation that I\'ve just described in terms of trying to give people with legitimate refugee claims a method of applying for that status without having to embark on a dangerous journey.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\'ve tried to address these root causes in Central America in a way that\'s just not possible in a place like Syria.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s why it\'s so difficult to compare these two situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what is true in both instances is that we do have to consider that the people that we\'re talking about are human beings and they should be afforded that kind of common decency, and afforded due process rights.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the Department of Homeland Security has indicated they\xe2\x80\x99re committed to, and that is an important part of this equation, that individuals who are targeted in these operations are only subject to them once they have been ordered removed from the country by an Immigration court.\xc2\xa0 And they are only subject to these operations once they have exhausted all of their humanitarian claims.\xc2\xa0 So there is a commitment to due process, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a commitment to enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Zika standoff, the administration still says it\'s a $1.9 billion request.\xc2\xa0 That was from like January 25th or so that you got the document that you often show us.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was technically February 22nd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 The question is, now that the Senate has taken some action, is there someplace where the administration is willing to compromise on that position you\xe2\x80\x99ve held to for so long, given the public health urgency of this matter, as you clearly outlined it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, when we talk about compromise, at least the way that you have set it up, it contemplates not giving our public health professionals everything that they say that they need so that they can do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 So it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come to that, I guess is my point.\xc2\xa0 If our goal here is to protect the public health and well-being of the American people, if that is our top priority, then why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just do what our public health professionals suggest and pass the kind of proposal that they have said encapsulates the need?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the reality is that the country is mired in political gridlock and things don\'t get done, and here\xe2\x80\x99s an example where apparently the public health is at risk because there\xe2\x80\x99s little compromise on both sides.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, the same question for the other side, but is this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I just reject that, Ron.\xc2\xa0 This is not about the administration not being willing to compromise.\xc2\xa0 This is the specific request that was put forward by public health experts.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what is necessary.\xc2\xa0 And the only thing that Republicans in the House have come forward on is funding at like a third of the level that our public health experts recommend but taking every single penny of that money away from efforts to protect the American people from Ebola.\xc2\xa0 So that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense at all.\xc2\xa0 That is a dumb approach.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t really understand why one would even consider an approach like that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A compromise that protects the interests of public health --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Like gutting our funding to protect the American people from the Ebola virus?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cGutting\xe2\x80\x9d is not the word I\'d use.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s the word that our public health professionals would use.\xc2\xa0 I just went through this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 There are 100 staff at the CDC -- 100 CDC staffers, government employees, that right now, as we speak, are in West Africa, processing 10,000 samples a month to try to fight the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are saying we should just gut funding for that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason -- I don\'t think there would be any justification for gutting funding for that just to -- as somebody who stood up here in the fall of 2014 and explained what our government was doing to try to protect people from a deadly virus.\xc2\xa0 But to say that we\'re going to gut funding for that because that\'s the only way that we can pay to protect the American people from anther dangerous virus that could potentially infect pregnant women and their babies -- that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do -- there are lots of things where Democrats and Republicans need to just try to sit down and compromise, and maybe they relate to things like taxes or the appropriate size of government, or maybe even our approach to dealing with education reform or job training, or something.\xc2\xa0 That is something that should be subject to the political process where there is debate, where there\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy, where there\xe2\x80\x99s bargaining and then ultimately common ground where we can advance something that represents a compromise.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the public health and safety of the American people, there should be no compromising.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the TSA lines that we talked about yesterday, there have been a number of senators, Democrats, who have asked for the airlines to suspend or compromise -- or change, or compromise, again -- (laughter) -- to suspend their baggage fees to move the process along.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the administration supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the individual business decisions of the airlines is up to them.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, the airlines and industry experts can speak to what impact that would have on lines at the airports.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of steps that TSA has taken to try to address this serious problem, and it does relate directly to the need to ensure that we are protecting our aviation system, but also trying to minimize inconvenience for travelers.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the TSA takes quite seriously and they\xe2\x80\x99re working through some creative solutions to try to reduce those lines without compromising safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have confidence in the Administrator, Peter Neffenger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen, like I said, some creative steps that TSA has taken.\xc2\xa0 They have sought additional authority to use more resources to pay overtime so that TSA officers can work longer hours and work more, spend more time process passengers.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s this other solution they have floated, which is getting more airport personnel that don\'t have security functions to help expedite the process through security so that those security screeners that typically remind people to take off their belts or to fill the bin can actually be used to do screening, and it can be airport staffers that can help people navigate the security line.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of things that we can do to expand our capacity and try to shorten those lines.\xc2\xa0 But, look, this is a tough problem and the President absolutely has confidence that Mr. Neffenger can solve this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously the summer travel season is coming.\xc2\xa0 Given there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem, given there are staffing shortages, given there\xe2\x80\x99s this 10-point plan, can travelers reasonably expect that the situation is going to get better in the next couple of months?\xc2\xa0 And if not, who is going to be held accountable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the TSA has indicated they expect the situation will improve as some of the staffing increases that they have authorized start to have an impact on individual airports.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that TSA is encouraging people to do is to apply for pre-check.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re a frequent traveler, you can get a background check in advance so that the security screening that you have to go through is different.\xc2\xa0 That presumably would make it possible for you to go through a shorter line.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s also going to have the effect of shortening the line for everybody else.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly want people to be aware of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we do anticipate, again, based on the solutions that TSA has been working to implement, I know that TSA has said that they expect that the situation should improve in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two last housekeeping things.\xc2\xa0 Before the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming trip, is there going to be a more detailed briefing or backgrounder about what exactly -- the goals, objective, timetables?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we will have some more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip before he departs on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still working on putting together a plan for doing that, but we\'ll be in touch with you on that.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s something you can certainly look for before the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You will obviously do it before that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But we can coordinate later and see if we can sync up our schedules.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to the conversation about Gitmo and Senator Roberts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you saying it\'s simply a false claim by him that the administration struck a deal to not transfer prisoners?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying I can\'t account for the substance of private conversations that Senator Roberts had with the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize that that might be somewhat unsatisfying.\xc2\xa0 The good news is, is that the Department of Defense official who had that conversation with Senator Roberts has put out a statement making very clear exactly what was communicated to Senator Roberts.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d refer you to that statement so he can walk you through it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Deputy Secretary of Defense -- I have that statement -- but it basically says all options are on the table, but we\'re running out of time to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not really a conclusive statement there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what you\'re saying is that you don\'t stand by -- if there was a promise in private conversation, that\'s not the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position to promise and close off Kansas as a possible site.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the private conversations that Senator Roberts had.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not privy to them.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the phone.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t been briefed on those private conversations.\xc2\xa0 What I can explain to you is the position that the administration has taken with regard to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the same position that is strongly supported by a large bipartisan group of national security experts, including people who\xe2\x80\x99ve dedicated their lives to protecting this country, like General Powell and General Petraeus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but no decisions have been made on where these prisoners would be transferred beyond the proposal as it was sent and approved by the White House to the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t make that decision as long as Congress is preventing the transfer of any Gitmo detainees anywhere to American soil.\xc2\xa0 And that is a ridiculous policy because the truth of the matter is there are already hardened convicted terrorists serving time in American prisons on American soil right now.\xc2\xa0 People like Richard Reid, the infamous shoe bomber.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit.\xc2\xa0 All of these are individuals who went through the court system in the United States; they were convicted of their crimes and they are currently serving time in American prisons on American soil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know how to protect the country using our Article III courts and using the American prison system.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then anyone on the Hill who has a belief that sites have been ruled out is simply misunderstanding the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand much of what Republicans say when they advocate on this issue, so all I can do is try to explain as clearly as I possibly can exactly what our approach is.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that the approach that we have been pursuing for the last several years is the same approach that we are pursuing today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'re no closer?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, not.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we continue to see obstacles that members of Congress have put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on Nigeria, first?\xc2\xa0 There were reports today the Nigerian military was claiming that they did find one of the so-called Chibok girls, one of the schoolgirls that was taken by Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of them disappeared.\xc2\xa0 The admin at the time had been very vocal in calling for their return.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on this, or confirmation?\xc2\xa0 Have you seen these reports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports, but let me see if we can get you some more information on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you clarify whether the administration has made a decision on whether it is willing to sell certain weapons to the current President Buhari of Nigeria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen some reporting speculating about this.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any decision that\'s been made, but we can follow up with you on that as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You made some comparisons to this campaign season and 2008.\xc2\xa0 And, yeah, there are some similarities, absolutely, but there are also enormous differences.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, you have a socialist running against a former Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 You have debate over what the party should stand for, what being a progressive even means.\xc2\xa0 And we just heard Senator Feinstein say that she\'s worried that if Sanders stays in the race past June, you could see something like what happened in the 1968 convention.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s kind of the comparison she\'s using.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s off the mark to be worried about a risk like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that right now that\'s not something that we\'re concerned about.\xc2\xa0 Again, this has been a vigorous primary contest, and that ultimately has had the effect of mobilizing millions of Americans across the country who have gotten engaged in democratic politics and gotten engaged in the process of choosing the Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good for America.\xc2\xa0 That\'s good for our democracy.\xc2\xa0 I also happen to think that\'s probably pretty good for the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 And in 2008, that process and that engagement across the country ended up being a harbinger of Democratic success in the future, in the general election.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, that will be true this time, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she\'s worried about the party being harmed if he stays in much longer.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself not too long ago, at a private event, expressed concerns about party unity and it being about time for people to be behind one candidate.\xc2\xa0 So do you not share her views that this could be detrimental to the Democratic Party much longer?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at this point, no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t share those concerns.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there will be a need for Democrats to come together in the general election, and the President will be making that case.\xc2\xa0 But right now we\'re still probably not in the middle of -- I think probably nearing the end of a nationwide, competitive Democratic primary process that has engaged the American people from coast to coast.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing, and that kind of competition makes the candidates and makes the parties and makes our democracy stronger.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And maybe it\'s just about this one incident that happened most recently.\xc2\xa0 But now there\'s a lot of talk about the threat of violence, and what Dianne Feinstein just said fits in with that, as well.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not concerned about violence moving forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- no, because --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of riots, like in 1968 or something?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not something that we\'re concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, great.\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned yesterday, on the 9/11 legislation, that there was going to be some outreach now with the House.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe a little bit what that will look like?\xc2\xa0 And will the President himself get involved in that outreach?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any presidential conversations that have occurred at least in the last couple of days on this.\xc2\xa0 I think what that outreach will look like is the White House seeking to engage Democrats and Republicans who have expressed public concern about this legislation.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of people that have indicated that they share our concerns with this bill, and we\'ll work closely with them to try to prevent a legislative outcome that puts the United States at greater risk around the world.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to put our interests or our assets or our diplomats or our servicemembers at greater risk.\xc2\xa0 And that is a potential unintended consequence of the legislation as currently drafted and passed by the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are those conversations going to start soon, or now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you generally that the White House has already been in touch with members of the House of the Representatives about this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that those conversations have occurred at the presidential level at this point, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKaren, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a report out from MapLight.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an organization that tracks money in politics.\xc2\xa0 And it found that 15 of the 39 main donors to the Obama Foundation have been invited to meetings here at the White House with the President, and one of those meetings was in January of 2015, and there were two couples who had donated six figures, as well as the actress Julia Roberts was at that meeting.\xc2\xa0 The report also found that three-quarters of the contributors to the foundation that have been disclosed have been invited to the White House, including every donor that\'s kicked in more than $100,000.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on this report?\xc2\xa0 And are these meetings here at the White House, especially the ones with the President, are they specifically meant to raise money for the foundation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are not.\xc2\xa0 The President has made a commitment that he will not be raising money for the foundation while he\'s still in office.\xc2\xa0 What we have said about donors to the campaign also applies to donors at the foundation, and it\'s simply this:\xc2\xa0 Donating in support of the President\'s foundation does not guarantee you a meeting with the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent you from getting a meeting with the President of the United States, and that\'s the approach that we\'ve taken, again, with regard to supporters of the President\'s campaign, and it\'s the approach that we\'ve taken with regard to supporters of the President\'s foundation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more.\xc2\xa0 The Director of National Intelligence this morning, James Clapper, said that there\'s been indication of attempted hacks on campaign websites and campaign organizations.\xc2\xa0 Can you expand on what those indications are and how severe they might have been?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Director Clapper was talking about intelligence information.\xc2\xa0 And as the Director of National Intelligence, he\'s got greater latitude to discuss that information -- well, at least greater latitude than I do.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything I can say about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier the need to apply upward pressure on wages.\xc2\xa0 I\'m curious, as it relates to the overtime rule, how concerned is the White House on the economic pressure on small business in particular as they have to take on obviously more salaries and make shifts -- sometimes major structural shifts -- to accommodate the new, or as you put it, revised, regulations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, the approach that we have taken is one that is consistent with the need to focus on fairness.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'re talking about people who are the hardest-working Americans.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who, by definition, they\'re working overtime, and they should be treated fairly.\xc2\xa0 And that should be good for business.\xc2\xa0 And our view is that employers have had ample time to consider these changes.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been in the works for more than two years.\xc2\xa0 There were extensive comments that were put forward.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s more than 270,000 comments were received on the rule -- some people advocating for a higher threshold, some people advocating for a lower threshold.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve taken into account those comments in designing this rule.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that this will have a positive impact on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We anticipate this will have a positive impact on wages.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that ultimately this will be good for business as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good for business in what way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, good for business in that they can ensure that their workers are being paid fairly.\xc2\xa0 And it also, again, is going to put upward pressure on wages.\xc2\xa0 Henry Ford, who at one point made a decision to raise the pay of his workers so he could make sure that the people who are working to build the cars could afford to buy them.\xc2\xa0 So, ultimately, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking to strengthen the economy, putting more money in the pocket of middle-class workers and those workers that are trying to get into the middle class is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, in this situation it\xe2\x80\x99s not charity.\xc2\xa0 In this situation, it\xe2\x80\x99s about fairness.\xc2\xa0 In this situation, it\xe2\x80\x99s about making sure that people are being fairly compensated for their overtime.\xc2\xa0 These are the hardest -- these are by definition the hardest-working Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0 We believe that will be good for the economy overall, and a good economy is good for business.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Interesting bit in Politico.\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge that there is a bit of a race against the clock to try to beat the 23rd so that Donald Trump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance, were he to be elected, to sort of undo some of these regulations that the President is sort of trying to push through?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is a rule that\xe2\x80\x99s been --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a revision, I understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a revision but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a rule that\xe2\x80\x99s been in the works for more than two years.\xc2\xa0 So if we were rushing this rule through, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a very good job of rushing because it took more than two years to get it right.\xc2\xa0 What is true -- and this is something I guess I acknowledged in response to an earlier question -- obviously the next President will also have executive authority that they can wield and presumably they can make changes to this threshold as well.\xc2\xa0 We obviously hope that they won\xe2\x80\x99t, but this is an executive action and is consistent with what the President believes is a smart strategy to try to grow our economy from the middle out and focus on expanding economic opportunity for middle-class workers and those workers that are trying to get into the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Ohio?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously it is a place where these kinds of issues related to middle-class workers really resonates.\xc2\xa0 Senator Brown, who is hosting both the Vice President and Secretary Perez, has been a leading advocate for this change.\xc2\xa0 And they are going to an Ohio business where many workers, many employees of that business will benefit from it and the people who run that business think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to end up being good for the overall economy and good for their business prospects.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You see what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at.\xc2\xa0 It could have been Wyoming, but it\xe2\x80\x99s Ohio.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It could have been.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the two senators from Wyoming have been particularly aggressive advocates of the overtime rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The old politics is what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no real sort of, hey, listen, November -- Ohio is such a keystone state as it relates to -- with respect to my friends in Pennsylvania -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a major state, obviously, politically speaking.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a little bit of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Senator Brown is not on the ballot this time, at least not yet.\xc2\xa0 It was a joke.\xc2\xa0 I have no idea.\xc2\xa0 Come on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a little -- boost his prospects here.\xc2\xa0 But, look, Senator Brown is not on the ballot but he is somebody who has aggressively advocated for this rule.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has urged the administration to raise this threshold and it\xe2\x80\x99s because he is somebody who has rightly earned the reputation as somebody who is committed to fighting for American workers and he is as interested as the administration is in making sure that people are paid fairly, particularly middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple more.\xc2\xa0 Westinghouse.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned -- I just -- it sort of piqued my interest.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re building I guess new nuclear facilities over in China, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mm-hmm.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they building any here?\xc2\xa0 Is the President getting them to do sort of that clean energy work here that might employ Americans?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been decades since we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a major reactor built in the States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there is one that is going through the permitting process that began early in the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a briefing on the latest status of what that is.\xc2\xa0 But what we certainly have seen here though is a dramatic growth in renewable energy because of some of the policy decisions that President Obama has made.\xc2\xa0 Since President Obama took office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that wind energy has tripled and the amount of energy that is produced from solar has increased thirtyfold since President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 That is a result of investments that were made early on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Recovery Act included the largest-ever investment in renewable energy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s already starting to pay dividends, both in terms of reducing our carbon footprint, but also in terms of business opportunities that are good for our broader economic growth but also good for job creation.\xc2\xa0 And so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Westinghouse that\xe2\x80\x99s building nuclear plants in China because China is looking for ways that they can reduce their carbon footprint.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good for economic growth back here in the United States because that\xe2\x80\x99s a good American company.\xc2\xa0 But we have also seen a wide variety of American companies building wind turbines and installing solar panels, which has the same positive economic impact on this country too.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 I want to give you another run at the comparison between people who are coming over our borders -- often illegally, unfortunately -- and refugees in Europe.\xc2\xa0 They both -- it would appear, at least from the outside -- are attempting to escape devastating circumstances, and I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand or square the difference from a policy perspective from the White House\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint, because they both would seem to be in desperate need of our help -- whether they\xe2\x80\x99re in Europe and you\xe2\x80\x99re calling on other European countries to reach out and help them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that you talked about -- I think you said 10,000 was originally the number in terms of refugees, and I just sort of look at that number and I say, good, that we should probably, from a policy perspective, if the President wants to make that argument, good, make that argument.\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t make that argument I think (inaudible) and at the same time say, yeah, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to help these people.\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can understand why people might be confused and here\xe2\x80\x99s the -- the commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made with regard to refugees is actually, for this fiscal year, I believe it is around 80,000.\xc2\xa0 We can get you the precise number.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year but about 80,000 overall.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, that could potentially include refugees from Central America but that would require them to go through the rigorous process that has been established.\xc2\xa0 And this is a process that includes intense background checks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a process that includes a careful vetting of their background to determine whether or not they qualify for refugee status.\xc2\xa0 And what we have sought to do is to make it easier for individuals in a handful of Central American countries to apply for that status without even leaving their country.\xc2\xa0 And the idea is that that would give them the opportunity to be considered for some form of humanitarian relief or refugee status that would allow them to travel legally into the United States after having their background carefully vetted without having to risk the dangerous journey through Mexico, sometimes in the hands of a human smuggler to try to get here.</p>\n<p>\n\tA process like that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in Syria because nobody -- or hardly anybody in the international community is able to work with the central government there, and the central government has demonstrated that they have no ability to control a security situation in that country.\xc2\xa0 The situation in a place like El Salvador or Honduras is also difficult and there are people who face terrible life circumstances in that country, too.\xc2\xa0 But at least we have a central government there with whom the United States can work to try to address that situation.\xc2\xa0 So we have provided them substantial resources to try to deal with the security situation there, to try to deal with economic development in those countries that is lacking.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at least there\xe2\x80\x99s something to work with, something to build on when you\xe2\x80\x99re considering a place like El Salvador or Honduras.\xc2\xa0 That kind of platform doesn\xe2\x80\x99t currently exist in Syria right now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons -- this is sort of a creative way to make an argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for a couple of years now, which is that the only way that we are really going to solve the problem of Syria is with a political solution where we see a political transition that has President Assad leaving power and somebody else coming into power in Syria that bears the legitimacy of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And then the rest of the international community can work with that person and that person\xe2\x80\x99s government to try to bring in the foundation that will start to rebuild that country and give people who have been threatened there a reason to feel like they can remain home and not be the victim of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I just clarify something?\xc2\xa0 You said recently that no federal funds would be cut off to North Carolina while the legal process was ongoing over their transgender bill.\xc2\xa0 Is the agency review still going on?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is it possible that they could come out with at least a finding?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the work that\xe2\x80\x99s going on at individual agencies.\xc2\xa0 Presumably, there might be some consideration of the impact of HB2 on the policies of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 So that consideration may be ongoing.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to check with each individual agency on this.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that no action will be taken to block funding as long as the Department of Justice litigation is moving through the courts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what were the agencies?\xc2\xa0 Education and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I think there were a number of agencies that have undertaken these kinds of reviews, but the most prominent ones have been Education, Transportation.\xc2\xa0 I believe HHS and the Department of Labor have also considered whether or not this law would have an impact on federally funded programs in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 I think those are the most prominent ones, but we can take a look at this and see if we can get you some other suggestions of agencies to contact.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just briefly, have you gotten any complaints or concerns or protests from veterans\xe2\x80\x99 groups over the President\xe2\x80\x99s stop in Hiroshima?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m always trepidacious about giving you this answer, because presumably, somebody in this country of 300 million people doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I can tell you is that the overwhelming response that the administration has gotten has been either positive or at least sympathetic to what the President is trying to do.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true of even those who fought in World War II.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is the \xe2\x80\x9cGreatest Generation\xe2\x80\x9d of Americans.\xc2\xa0 That generation will go down in history for saving the United States and the world from tyranny.\xc2\xa0 They sacrificed greatly.\xc2\xa0 But I think even many of those veterans would acknowledge that the relationship between the United States and Japan has, before their eyes, been radically transformed.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and Japan are now able to cooperate on a wide range of issues, some of which have direct implications for U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the ability of our nations to cooperate and to coordinate, and to strengthen our alliance, is good for the United States and bodes well for the future.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a large portion of even World War II veterans who may have risked their lives fighting Japanese soldiers in World War II who understand the potential that exists, and understands the argument that the President has made.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will acknowledge I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I\xe2\x80\x99d feel the same way if I were them.\xc2\xa0 I think in their -- as they think about their service to the country, I think that demonstrates a profound depth of selflessness.\xc2\xa0 But I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of courage and patriotism that many of those Americans showed on the battlefield, and many of them are showing it now -- here we are, seven decades later -- even as they inhabit their role as citizen.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of passion in any primary process, but it seems to me that we\xe2\x80\x99re a little bit beyond that.\xc2\xa0 A lot of Sanders supporters seem to believe that the primary process is rigged against him, and the integrity of the entire nominating process is being questioned.\xc2\xa0 The Nevada situation aside, broadly speaking, does the President believe the rules the Democratic Party has laid out from the beginning are being followed and have been fair?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t closely examined the rules.\xc2\xa0 I can say that the White House believes in the integrity of the Democratic National Committee and their commitment to the fair implementation of the rules.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that they\xe2\x80\x99re working with state parties all across the country to implement their delegate selection plans to ensure that there is a fair and transparent process for choosing state delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing, though, as you were asking, that occurs to me that I think sort of helps to put in rather stark relief the intensity of the campaign in 2008 and the impact that that could have had on the general election in 2008 -- there were not an insignificant number of Democrats in May of 2008 who were saying publicly that they were prepared to organize and raise money in support of the Republican presidential candidate.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of questions about whether or not there would be an aggressive \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats for McCain\xe2\x80\x9d movement that would tip the balance of the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor all of the passion and ferocity and competitiveness of the Democratic primary in 2016, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read too many public accounts of that happening in this general election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics, a House committee passed a bill yesterday that would stop the District of Columbia from spending its own tax dollars without congressional approval.\xc2\xa0 If this were to pass the full House and the Senate, would the President veto it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen some of the reporting about this.\xc2\xa0 I know that there is a -- not coincidentally, I assume -- a prominent story in The Washington Post about this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know that our team has had a chance to consider carefully the impact of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still working its way through the legislative process; obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s just passed through the committee.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at that proposal and get back to you in terms of a position.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Pam Coulter\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Will there be both United States and Japanese veterans attending the service at Hiroshima?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there will be U.S. veterans there, but as we get closer to locking down the details of the trip, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\tTom.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have a follow-up on the D.C. question.\xc2\xa0 In 2003, the measure that the House Republicans were trying to block with the support of Speaker Ryan was endorsed by President Obama.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House would have a reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me dig into this and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that we follow up with you on this as well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not familiar with the details of this particular bill.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still an opportunity, obviously, to have an impact on what it would do as it works its way through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if I can get you a specific position on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Since you came out to the podium, about a half hour ago, AP is reporting that Donald Trump has released his list of 11 potential Supreme Court nominees that he plans to vet.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the list, but it includes Steven Colloton of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals; Judge Allison Eid of the Colorado Supreme Court; Thomas Hardiman of the 3rd Circuit; and William Pryor of the 11th Circuit.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not the whole list, but do any of those names sound familiar to you from your previous vettings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gotten into people that the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always a first time.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly, there is always a first time.\xc2\xa0 Let me make this observation.\xc2\xa0 I would be surprised if there are any Democrats who would describe any of those 11 individuals as a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 But the individual that President Obama has put forward is somebody that Republicans have described as a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 And I think that speaks to the wisdom of the Senate acting on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, and I think it speaks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in a way that is consistent with his desire to protect the Supreme Court from the kind of partisan wars that it\xe2\x80\x99s been subjected to of late.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know the President -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve said the President feels very strongly that Trump will not be the next President, but he is about to become the major party nominee.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a thumbnail sketch of what you think a Supreme Court that\xe2\x80\x99s populated by Trump nominees, what direction that would take the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to others to speculate what Mr. Trump would do as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 My responsibility here is to forcefully advocate for what the President has done and what he is going to do over the eight months that he has remaining in office.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get done.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M.
