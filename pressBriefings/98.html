Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction and addendum, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I apologize for the tardy start today. \xc2\xa0I do not have any opening comments, so we can go straight to questions. \xc2\xa0Darlene, would you like to go first?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure, thank you. \xc2\xa0Could you talk a little bit about the reversal on oil drilling on the Atlantic Coast and why the administration or the President is changing their mind on allowing that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, the Department of the Interior has spent a great deal of time soliciting input from a variety of interested parties on this. \xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s proposal specifically was informed by more than a million comments. \xc2\xa0More than I think 23 public meetings were convened in addition to extensive outreach with members of the public, nonprofit organizations, elected officials and other interested parties across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were a variety of factors that contributed to the decision about the Atlantic. \xc2\xa0It included conflicts that were raised by the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there are some significant military facilities in some portions of the Atlantic Coast where these leases were considered. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Defense raised concerns about the way those drilling and exploring activities could have an impact on their work in that region of the country. \xc2\xa0Commercial interests raised similar concerns. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso factored in was the response from the opposition that existed in many coastal communities who were concerned about these offshore drilling sites. \xc2\xa0And then finally, there was also an assessment of current energy market dynamics, and that factored into this overall decision, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, this governs the next five years, so this lease sale has been removed for the 2017-2022 window. \xc2\xa0And the Department of the Interior has made a decision that is consistent with the policy priorities that the President has outlined, and consistent with the variety of factors that should be considered for a decision like this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did any one of these pockets of opposition carry more weight with the administration than any of the other? \xc2\xa0Maybe the Pentagon, for example?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think we took all of this feedback quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And obviously, we wanted to ensure that the decision was made reflecting the interests and concerns and priorities that have been laid out by the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0But it would be wrong to assume that any one of these was the driving factor. \xc2\xa0This was a decision that was based on the variety of public comments and the variety of factors that I\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decision to start pulling out some of its troops from Syria? \xc2\xa0And was he caught by surprise by that announcement yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that the United States did not have -- let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0Russia did not give direct advance notice of this decision to the United States. \xc2\xa0However, as you saw, the President had an opportunity -- it was a previously scheduled telephone call with President Putin. \xc2\xa0And it was an opportunity for the two leaders to continue their discussions, both about the situation in Syria and about the situation in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have long said that our priority in Syria is bringing about the political transition in a country that\'s long overdue. \xc2\xa0After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s the political chaos inside of Syria that is the root cause of so many of the problems that we\'re dealing with right now. \xc2\xa0And this is everything from the growth of ISIL, to the widespread humanitarian disaster, to even the challenges that many European countries are experiencing in taking in an influx of migrants from that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe root cause of all of those significant problems is the political turmoil inside of Syria, and the fact that President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0And in fact, we saw an affirmative statement from the Russians -- not for the first time, but it was notable that they\xe2\x80\x99ve reiterated their commitment again yesterday to redoubling their efforts to work with the international community to advance the political dialogue and to bring about the kind of political changes in Syria that are needed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the announcement? \xc2\xa0Is that something that he -- a move that he welcomes?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a move that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching. \xc2\xa0The earliest indications are that the Russians are following through. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to determine at this point exactly what impact it will have on the broader situation, and most importantly the continued implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities and the continued pursuit of political talks inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how the constructive Russian contribution to the political talks was going to be important to their success. \xc2\xa0And so that\'s why we, again, made note of the fact that they have indicated publicly -- again, as recently as yesterday \xc2\xa0-- that they recognize that these political talks and the successful completion of a transition is in the interest of the region and other countries that have interests in the region, like Russia and the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What theories -- or does the White House have any idea or theory on why you think Russia made this move at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would hesitate to speculate about what President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s motivations are. \xc2\xa0To the extent that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to discuss them publicly, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously in the best position to describe them.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve heard me say for five or six months now that our focus was on the political transition in Syria, and we\xe2\x80\x99d raised concerns about the fact that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive military intervention would -- could potentially remove the incentive for President Assad to engage constructively in those talks -- or at least his regime, the government to engage in those talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there was always an element of tension in the Russian position as something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted again before. \xc2\xa0Russia has been saying for a long time that a political transition was needed. \xc2\xa0And the Russian military intervention propped up Assad and only made it more difficult for that political resolution to be reached. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t know if that was factoring into this decision or not. \xc2\xa0But if they continue to follow through, and if they continue to engage constructively in the international effort to bring about those talks and to bring all the parties together to try to facilitate an agreement, then that would be a positive outcome not just for the people of Syria and for countries in the region that have been destabilized by the chaos there, it would also be good news for Russia and the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, why did the President feel that the Friends of Ireland luncheon on Capitol Hill was the place to, again, talk about Donald Trump and violence and vulgarity on the campaign trail? \xc2\xa0Was he reacting to something specific? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President and many of us here at the White House were struck by how the annual reception that was generally hosted by Speaker Ryan is typically an event that\xe2\x80\x99s characterized by a lot of bipartisan comradery and fellowship. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s an annual opportunity for leaders in both parties in Washington to put aside their partisan affiliations and celebrate one part of America that makes us great -- and that is the legacy in this country of immigration and the deep ties that our country has to Ireland. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd after all, Irish immigrants have thrived in America, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the kind of possibility that exists in America, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what makes our country unique. \xc2\xa0And the President has long believed that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of what makes America great. \xc2\xa0And that is something that is regularly celebrated by Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this kind of comradery and fellowship that is on display at this annual event unfortunately does stand in stark contrast to a lot of the vulgar and divisive rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0And the President marked the occasion by pointing that out. \xc2\xa0And noting his ongoing commitment --regardless of who is responsible or most responsible for the current climate -- the President is committed to redoubling his efforts to ensure that our political disagreements can be debated without demonizing and marginalizing or questioning the very motives of people who just happen to disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President did take the advantage, the opportunity today to talk about it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident it\xe2\x80\x99s not for the last time.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, did President Putin in his call with President Obama yesterday offer any assurances about the ability to keep violence contained in Syria despite the Russian withdrawal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Russians read out their side of the conversation. \xc2\xa0And if they choose to share more about President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s comments to President Obama, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them do that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me try to answer your question this way, though, Jeff, because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one. \xc2\xa0There was a lot of skepticism about the international community\xe2\x80\x99s ability to successfully implement a Cessation of Hostilities. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that as some sort of backhanded sleight at the media. \xc2\xa0I think that I demonstrated some skepticism about how smoothly the Cessation of Hostilities would be implemented. \xc2\xa0And there have been bumps. \xc2\xa0There have been some violations that have been reported. \xc2\xa0The United States has been working with our international partners to investigate and follow up on those violations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut by and large, the implementation of the Cessation of Hostilities, so far at least, has gone somewhat better than expected. \xc2\xa0We have seen a dramatic reduction in airstrikes against those parties that have signed onto the Cessation of Hostilities. \xc2\xa0There have been some reports of violations that are related to small-arms fire and some operations that are carried out by tanks and other armored vehicles. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about those violations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we said all along that the Cessation of Hostilities would hopefully lead to two things. \xc2\xa0One is allow for aid workers to provide badly needed humanitarian assistance to those communities that have caught in the crossfire for a long time. \xc2\xa0But the second goal was to try to lower the temperature, so to speak, inside of Syria so that the political dialogue would have more of an opportunity to advance. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re testing that proposition right now. \xc2\xa0The proximity talks that are hosted by the U.N. in Geneva have begun. \xc2\xa0There are still some additional parties that need to travel to Geneva to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got everybody there that we need to have a successful round of talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we are seeing some halting progress on the diplomatic track, and we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by that. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on many previous occasions that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive military intervention in support of the Assad regime was a hindrance to those talks. \xc2\xa0The Russians have promised to at least scale back that barrier, if not remove it entirely. \xc2\xa0And it remains to be seen how and whether they\xe2\x80\x99ll follow through, but it also remains to be seen exactly what impact it will have on the talks themselves. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are heartened by the fact that the Russians reiterated just yesterday that they support the successful -- that they support progress in these talks, and they are seeking to engage in them constructively and to encourage all of the parties to do so. \xc2\xa0That obviously is -- again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something they said for the first time yesterday, but it was notable that they repeated it, because that obviously is consistent with the goals that the United States has articulated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the White House -- or does the President believe that you were wrong about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s intentions in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, at this point I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s constructive for me to try to spend a whole lot of time assessing their motives. \xc2\xa0So what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is trying to advance these political talks. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Russians say that they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in. \xc2\xa0Both the Russian leaders and American leaders, and leaders of a whole bunch of other countries have all acknowledged that advancing those talks is clearly in our collective best interest. \xc2\xa0So the question now really is, how effectively can the international community coordinate to support these talks? \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to do our part. \xc2\xa0The Russians have vowed to do theirs; hopefully, they will. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what kind of progress we can make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any Supreme Court updates today, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do not have any Supreme Court updates today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, any reaction from the White House to the selection of a president in Myanmar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did get a briefing on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there were elections in Burma, and they did elect a new president. \xc2\xa0And the United States does congratulate Htin Kyaw on his election to the presidency. \xc2\xa0His election is yet another important step forward in Burma\xe2\x80\x99s democratic transition. \xc2\xa0The formation of a democratically elected, civilian-led government, and the peaceful transfer of power mark an extraordinary moment in that country\xe2\x80\x99s history. \xc2\xa0And we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the people of Burma and with the new government of Burma as it works to make progress on a wide range of issues, including additional democratic reforms. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged, and the President has had the opportunity to talk about this when he was in Burma, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the important progress that political reformers in Burma have made. \xc2\xa0But there are additional steps that we believe they should take, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to support the Burmese people and the Burmese government as they decide how to implement those additional reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the campaign today. \xc2\xa0You noted he was inspired by the bipartisan nature of the event, but it also just so happens that there are several high-stakes primaries today. \xc2\xa0Did that factor at all into the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to speak out this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I feel confident that the President would have -- well, I feel confident in telling you that the President would have made those comments even if the St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day activities had been held on St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day. \xc2\xa0So even if it had been Thursday, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President would have been struck by the same inspiration to note that this is an event that is often characterized by a lot of camaraderie and fellowship, and that that stands in pretty stark contrast, unfortunately, to the divisive and vulgar rhetoric that we have seen on the campaign trail of late.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the President also noted that countries around the world are following American politics closely. \xc2\xa0And I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this before, but the President today seemed to go a little bit further, suggesting that this corrosive behavior could be tarnishing the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican brand,\xe2\x80\x9d as he put it. \xc2\xa0Is the behavior on the campaign trail hurting U.S. foreign relations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President made this observation because you had the leaders of Ireland in the room as he was making the comments. \xc2\xa0But I think the President is concerned about the corrosive impact of the tone of the political debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting, and the President has never suggested, that there shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a robust debate about who should succeed the President in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0There should be an aggressive, vigorous, deeply engaged debate. \xc2\xa0The President went through that in 2008, and he went through it again in 2012. \xc2\xa0It is a sign of the strength of our democracy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite disappointed to see is the way that the divisive rhetoric has crept into the debate, because at least some politicians believe that by ginning up and inciting animosity, that they can motivate their supporters. \xc2\xa0That is not at all consistent with our tradition of civic responsibility in this country. \xc2\xa0And the President himself has observed that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have trouble building quite large crowds in communities coast to coast, and he didn\'t have to resort to belittling people, to suggest that somehow people who are different based on the way they look, or the way they pray, or the way they vote are somehow responsible for the problems plaguing this country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, the President motivated people by celebrating how much this country has in common, despite our differences. \xc2\xa0That diversity is a source of strength. \xc2\xa0The President certainly believes that. \xc2\xa0That isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a strength of our country. \xc2\xa0That observation ended up being an important strength of the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One question on Flint. \xc2\xa0The former EPA official in charge of Flint told Congress today that she doesn\'t think anyone at the EPA did anything wrong, but that they could have done more. \xc2\xa0Does the White House agree with that assessment of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Flint crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what we have -- as it relates to blame, this question of blame, that there are a couple of independent investigations taking a look at the situation and taking a close look at who knew what and when.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to avoid weighing in on that question. \xc2\xa0I think what is without a doubt true is that there is an important role for the federal government to play in supporting state and local officials who are primarily responsible for responding to this situation. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s why you have seen the federal government marshal such extensive resources, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s public health expertise, or environmental expertise to better test the water. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also mobilized significant financial resources to offer expanded health care to citizens in that community that have been affected by this situation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve offered up additional funding to open up Head Start centers and try to provide more services to people in that community who are struggling. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to continue to look for additional ways that the federal government can help.</p>\n<p>\n\tI failed to mention that there\xe2\x80\x99s also been an aggressive response on the part of FEMA, who has the kind of logistical expertise that allow them to greatly assist in the distribution of water and filters while state and local officials have been working to clean up the water supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0The Irish leader today said that the issue of the U.K.\xe2\x80\x99s referendum on leaving the EU came up during the meeting. \xc2\xa0Do you have any more details on that? \xc2\xa0And can you say now whether or not the President will visit the U.K. to make that case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updated scheduling announcements as it relates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Europe in April. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that he will travel to Germany in late April, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional information about other stops that he\xe2\x80\x99ll make on the trip. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have more detail to share with you about the conversation between the President and the Taoiseach. \xc2\xa0Obviously, our view of how the United States benefits from a strong British ally as a part of the EU is something that is in our national interest. \xc2\xa0But we also are quite respectful of the responsibility that the British people have to decide for themselves. \xc2\xa0And Prime Minister Cameron has committed to giving them that opportunity in late June. \xc2\xa0And we obviously respect the right of British voters to decide for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another issue that came up during the meeting was the EU\xe2\x80\x99s position on migrants. \xc2\xa0And I guess there is going to be a meeting later this week discussing the EU and Turkey and the deal they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to come to. \xc2\xa0There have been some concerns about human rights and whether or not that deal would comply with international law, the idea of sending back migrants en masse back to Turkey. \xc2\xa0Does the President share any of those concerns? \xc2\xa0And can you talk a little bit about if those concerns came up during the discussion today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that there have been reports of discussions among EU nations, and how they can more effectively coordinate with the Turks to address this significant influx of migrants that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with. \xc2\xa0I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- the predominant response in Europe has been an understanding of the humanity of these, in most cases, Syrians who are fleeing violence in their home country. \xc2\xa0And we have seen a lot of generosity and acts of human kindness in response.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that a broader policy response is also required, given the significant consequences this will have for these countries absorbing such a large influx of new arrivals. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I hesitate to speculate on what sort of agreement would be reached and how that could be judged by the rest of the international community. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll let them go ahead and do that work, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at what they decide, if anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then just one more on the Cuba announcements today. \xc2\xa0The idea of individualized people-to-people exchanges not done as part of a group -- is the White House confident that people will be able to go to Cuba on their own and set up these people-to-people exchanges and it not become just a tourism trip when they\xe2\x80\x99re not a part of a larger group that will organize, help with language barriers, and make sure that everything is going to comply with the existing embargo?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Treasury Department will be responsible for the implementation of these regulatory changes. \xc2\xa0The goal of these changes is pretty clear. \xc2\xa0We do believe that it will make it easier for Americans who wish to travel to Cuba to do so. \xc2\xa0Some of the other changes that were announced today will give Cubans easier and more regular access to the U.S. dollar, and more access to U.S. financial institutions, which could have the effect of expanding economic opportunity in Cuba. \xc2\xa0That obviously is something that the Cuban people have long sought.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also could apply more pressure to the Cuban government to implement additional reforms to the Cuban economy. \xc2\xa0All of that would be a good thing, and all of that would be in service of the basic policy goals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out from the beginning. \xc2\xa0I would just observe that those were also the policy goals under -- that were prioritized by the U.S. government for 50 years under our Cuba embargo and an attempt to isolate the Cuban nation. \xc2\xa0And they didn\'t make a lot of progress. \xc2\xa0And so we are hopeful that these changes will bring about some of the progress and reform that Americans have long sought in Cuba.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut when it comes to implementing the regulations and how people can travel to Cuba and be in compliance with the law, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department for the details of how that can be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, would you describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks on Capitol Hill today as an attempt to -- an olive branch to broach a divide?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\'t think I would describe it that way. \xc2\xa0I think the President was pretty direct in noting how concerned he is about the tone and tenor of the debate on the Republican side of the aisle. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been quite dismayed that some candidates have sought to target women and minorities and people with disabilities and religious minorities all in an effort to motivate their supporters. \xc2\xa0The President doesn\'t agree with that at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President did acknowledge that for those in public life and those of us -- myself included -- who speak frequently in public, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably made comments that we regret, some intemperate remarks that in hindsight were not appropriate, or certainly were not up to the standard that we would like to maintain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President acknowledged that he had some of those regrets himself, and that he was going to redouble his own commitment and his own efforts to try to live up to the high standard that the American people should rightly expect of their leaders. \xc2\xa0And frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Republican candidates to do the same thing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that this highlights -- and this is something that I noted yesterday -- it also makes it a little harder to answer the question for leaders in the Republican Party about why they can continue to support somebody who uses this rhetoric not just daily, but multiple times a day when he\xe2\x80\x99s hosting multiple events a day. \xc2\xa0So that\'s something that will have to get resolved on the Republican Party, and it will get resolved, as I noted yesterday, when somebody decides to step forward and show some leadership. \xc2\xa0But that will be for them to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But the hate speech, divisive rhetoric, vulgar words, as the President said, that\'s different than having a few intemperate remarks you regret. \xc2\xa0What was the President referring to on his own behalf? \xc2\xa0Was he suggesting that perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99s been too partisan in his own language? \xc2\xa0What was he referencing when he was thinking about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\'t talk to him about these specific remarks, so I don\'t know exactly what he had in mind. \xc2\xa0But my guess is his political opponents probably have a couple things right at the top of their mind that they would suggest could be described as intemperate, I guess was the word that the President used. \xc2\xa0And I think the President would acknowledge that he\xe2\x80\x99s not blameless. \xc2\xa0That\'s consistent with what he said in the State of the Union address, as well -- that there is more that he wished that he had succeeded in doing to try to bridge the stark partisan divide in our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess the difference here, Margaret, is that at least he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to bridge that partisan divide. \xc2\xa0And we see some other candidates who are trying -- who have basically leased a backhoe and are seeking to deepen it and exploit it for their own personal political gain. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the country. \xc2\xa0It certainly is not good for the way our country is viewed around the world. \xc2\xa0And leaders have a responsibility to rise above that and condemn it when they see other people doing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think this will mean some continued pointed questions for leaders in the Republican Party, because it\xe2\x80\x99s more than one presidential candidate on their side of the aisle who is engaged in these kinds of tactics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you said whether the President watched the footage from his hometown on Friday of the rally turned violent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t said. \xc2\xa0I know that he read about it. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that he saw some of the footage there. \xc2\xa0But he certainly is aware of what happened there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you if there was any conversation about SCOTUS, about a Supreme Court nomination while the President was on the Hill with some of the folks who will have to weigh in on that. \xc2\xa0And when the President mentioned he hoped -- I think he said something about the luck of the Irish holding for him and his nominee. \xc2\xa0Does that mean we have to see something St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day week?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It doesn\'t necessarily. \xc2\xa0That was not an indication of timing necessarily. \xc2\xa0But obviously the President was warmly received on Capitol Hill today for St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that his eminently qualified nominee to the Supreme Court -- whomever that person is -- will be similarly received on Capitol Hill, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But no conversations on the sidelines of his luncheon today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No specific conversations that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I quickly ask you, in your phrase when you were talking about whether the U.S. had advance notice of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s partial withdrawal, you said no direct advance notice.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does that mean?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It just means that the Russians did not give the United States direct advance notice of this announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which would be at the White House or State Department level. \xc2\xa0But there was some notice that was -- or awareness this would happen that didn\'t come through official means. \xc2\xa0Is that the right way to read it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to be as clear as I can. \xc2\xa0Yes, I think you noted that I chose my words carefully there, and so I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably just leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And would you say now that a crutch has been removed from what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up the Assad regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, this was an announcement that was made about 24 hours ago. \xc2\xa0And so I think the impact of this decision will depend a little bit on the way that the Russians follow through with their implementation of this decision. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell -- to assess exactly what impact this will have on the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating position, on their willingness to negotiate, and what the reaction will be on the part of the opposition groups who are negotiating -- at least in the course of proximity talks with the Syrian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of variables here, and the impact of this decision on all those variables is not immediately obvious. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to watch the situation. \xc2\xa0But again, what the Russians did restate yesterday was a commitment to pursuing diplomatic talks that would bring about a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So we obviously are heartened by that restatement of a priority that the United States shares.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what about coordination on ISIS now? \xc2\xa0I didn\'t see much in that statement about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t know that there are any announcements related to that. \xc2\xa0The thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on a number of occasions but I have not repeated today is that the Cessation of Hostilities that the United States helped to negotiate and implement does not have any impact on our ongoing military activities against ISIL. \xc2\xa0It doesn\'t have any impact on any of our coalition partners\xe2\x80\x99 ability to continue to advance our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any updates in terms of any renewed Russian commitment to the counter-ISIL campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Is there at any point in the conversation a metric whereby the Russians for withdrawing from Syria could have sanctions relief?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, the sanctions that have been imposed against Russia are a direct result of their flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And the Ukrainian government and the Russians, with the help of some of our European allies, did negotiate an agreement in Minsk whereby both sides would deescalate the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has been clear -- almost literally from day one -- that he would be prepared to relax sanctions on Russia, if not remove them entirely, if we saw Russia succeed in following through on the commitments that they made in the context of the Minsk talks. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, they have not done that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if the Russian government does want to see that kind of sanctions relief -- and these are sanctions that the United States has imposed in close coordination with our European allies -- I just note that because the impact of the European sanctions is more significant on the Russian economy than unilateral U.S. sanctions. \xc2\xa0But there is a clear path. \xc2\xa0Everybody knows exactly what needs to be done for those sanctions to be either rolled back or removed entirely. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s no ambiguity about that. \xc2\xa0And they relate directly to Russia following through on their Minsk commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s strictly Ukraine, not Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me follow. \xc2\xa0Putin said yesterday that he felt like he had achieved his objectives, and that was part of the reason why they were pulling out -- at least the main part, if you will -- of their military from Syria. \xc2\xa0Among his objectives -- shoring up the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0Is he wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think time will tell exactly how we can assess the impact of the decision that President Putin announced just 24 hours ago. \xc2\xa0And we certainly will be interested to understand exactly how and whether this changes the negotiating position of the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0Does this mean that they are more willing to negotiate or less willing to negotiate in good faith? \xc2\xa0Hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s the former and not the latter. \xc2\xa0But it also raises questions about what sort of impact it will have on the ability of the wide variety of opposition groups involved here, and how they engage in the process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just too early to tell whether or not that is an objective that\xe2\x80\x99s advanced by this Russian decision. \xc2\xa0But again, the fact that they have restated that this is a priority for them is a good thing because it happens to be a long-stated priority of the United States. \xc2\xa0And if that means that we can more effectively work together to accomplish that shared goal, that would be good news. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one on Syria. \xc2\xa0I want to read John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s statement; I assume you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it today. \xc2\xa0It reads, in part, \xe2\x80\x9cThe administration consoled itself with the mantra that there is no military solution. \xc2\xa0Rather than facing the reality that there is a clear military dimension to any political solution in Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d he goes on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunately, that is what Russia and its proxies have demonstrated in Syria.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Is Mr. McCain right or is he wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen his entire statement, but if he is suggesting that somehow a large-scale U.S. ground combat invasion of Syria is warranted and is the best way to advance U.S. interests in Syria, then he\xe2\x80\x99s flat wrong about that. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not news, though. \xc2\xa0That is a well-known difference between Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s approach to these kinds of conflicts and the more prudent approach that President Obama has taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I recognize that continues to frustrate, and in some cases anger, Senator McCain. \xc2\xa0But the President feels quite confident that effectively using our military power to support forces on the ground to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL -- in some cases that means the United States military carrying out airstrikes against prominent ISIL targets -- that is consistent with our strategy. \xc2\xa0But a large-scale ground combat operation to carry out regime change inside of Syria is not at all consistent with our national security priorities, and the failure to understand that is a failure to appreciate the lessons of our recent history in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about EPA Administrator McCarthy. \xc2\xa0She says we could have done things better. \xc2\xa0She didn\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge that there was any responsibility whole-scale on the EPA in Flint. \xc2\xa0Given the fact that Susan Hedman resigned back on February 1st, given the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been following this story for quite some time -- children have been impacted, families have been impacted adversely -- is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment that there will be justice in Flint? \xc2\xa0And what does that look like?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, a question about justice I do think raises some questions about blame. \xc2\xa0And again, given the independent ongoing investigations there, I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to comment on that aspect of this. \xc2\xa0But certainly the President does feel deeply that the people of Flint who have been the victims of this terrible situation are owed something by their government. \xc2\xa0And there is a responsibility for the federal government to support -- and the state and local governments who are primarily responsible for responding to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the federal government come in and offer up assistance in the form of bottled water and filters to meet the urgent, immediate need, but also to consider funding for Head Start centers, for additional health care to needy members of that community so that they can get the treatment that they need and that they deserve. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what we also need to see, frankly, is we also need to see the United States Congress step up and offer some financial assistance so that the significant infrastructure needs in Flint can also be addressed. \xc2\xa0This is something that the state and obviously the local government can\xe2\x80\x99t do on its own. \xc2\xa0The local government, frankly -- many people believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re in this situation because the local government had to be turned over to an emergency manager. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious that the local government would not have the financial resources to deal with a problem as significant and widespread as this one. \xc2\xa0It certainly is an appropriate role for the federal government to intervene in those kinds of situations, to look out for American citizens who are in a pretty dire situation. \xc2\xa0And unfortunately, this has gotten stalled, blocked by Republicans in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And that\'s unfortunate. \xc2\xa0And hopefully we\'ll see the Congress step up and fulfill its responsibility to the people of Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve said a lot now about Flint, and now you\'re saying that the people there are owed something by their government. \xc2\xa0Even though you say that you\'re hesitant to assign blame, you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned a couple of times now the responsibility that the local and state governments have. \xc2\xa0But it\'s indisputable that the EPA knew about a problem there for a long time and did not notify the public. \xc2\xa0Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s an investigation going on, but if you\'re willing to say so much about state and local government and some of the details surrounding this, why are you so hesitant to acknowledge that the EPA could have done more, or to say something -- it seems like that\'s one area of this that you deliberately leave out, where you say what the EPA has done. \xc2\xa0But it\'s hard to ignore the fact that they knew about this for a very long time and did not tell anyone.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think you\'re jumping to conclusions. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think you know that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone. \xc2\xa0There are --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They didn\xe2\x80\x99t notify the public, and they knew about it. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s paper that says that they knew about this. So it\'s hard to dispute that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s also paper that\'s called the law that indicates that state and local authorities are the ones that are primarily responsible for the water supply.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Primarily responsible, right.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that limits what the EPA can do. \xc2\xa0Now, the question is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Don\'t you see a fundamental problem there? \xc2\xa0If there\xe2\x80\x99s lead poisoning that is even a remote possibility -- even if it\'s a remote possibility and they know that that could be happening, wouldn\'t that be the ideal time to break that law? \xc2\xa0Like wouldn\'t that be a reason to say that law needs to be changed then? \xc2\xa0I mean, it almost sounds like another layer of the bureaucracy that made this entire mess. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, I think one of the things that we should acknowledge here is that the EPA Administrator more than a month ago, recognizing the situation that you just pointed out might exist, sent a letter to governors and local officials all across the country, making clear that they understand exactly how the lead and copper rule is enforced, and making clear exactly what role the EPA will play in ensuring that it\'s enforced. \xc2\xa0And if they follow -- if they fail to follow the way that that rule is governed, then the EPA will not hesitate to step in to ensure the protection of the health and wellbeing of citizens in local communities across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, there is a responsibility for the EPA to both support the ongoing local and state-led response in Flint, but also to proactively make sure that local and state officials across the country are put on notice about how exactly to implement this rule, about how exactly to monitor the implementation of the rule, to make sure that people and other communities across the country aren\'t affected by the same kind of mistakes. \xc2\xa0And, yes, that is a responsibility of the federal government. \xc2\xa0Yes, that is something that the federal government owes citizens across the country. \xc2\xa0And, yes, that mission will not be advanced if Republicans succeed in following through on their promise to eliminate the EPA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that the state and local government failed people there, isn\'t there also in this a possibility that the EPA failed people there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, that\'s why I\'m reluctant to talk about exactly what happened because this is all under investigation both within the administration but also by law enforcement authorities. \xc2\xa0And again, I don\'t want to say anything beyond what I\'ve said thus far because I don\'t want to be perceived as trying to put my thumb on the scale. \xc2\xa0We should get to the bottom of what exactly happened so we can make sure that it never happens anywhere else again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\'s just that you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly mentioned the state and local government that had primary responsibility --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, because there is no denying that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that the EPA had a role in this, knowing about it and not saying anything to the people there who were being poisoned for almost a year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I dispute the premise of your question because I don\'t think that it\'s true that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anybody. \xc2\xa0I think in some ways that is actually the crux of this dispute, is the suggestion that state and local officials may not have followed the warnings of the EPA.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, this is something that is being looked at. \xc2\xa0And again, I don\'t want to be perceived as weighing in here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, fair enough. \xc2\xa0And in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him several times now slam the rhetoric on the trail, and it seems like the President is getting more robust in the way he describes it. \xc2\xa0Today he used the world \xe2\x80\x9cvulgar\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cvicious.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So what is -- as we hear him make these statements, even at times when they\'re not really expected or necessarily a part of what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, what does he expect the effect of that to be? \xc2\xa0What is his goal in repeatedly bringing this up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in this case, he was observing the stark contrast between the collegiality and camaraderie and fellowship at the bipartisan St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day celebration on Capitol Hill, and the divisive, vulgar rhetoric on the part of Republicans on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think that stark contrast is something that all of you would have noted even if the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t himself proactively raised it. \xc2\xa0And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of raising it is to underscore at least his own personal belief about the responsibility that political leaders in this country have. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our best leaders are the ones who continually remind us that our country is stronger when we\'re not turning against one another. \xc2\xa0And that stands in pretty stark contrast to the cynical tactics that are being employed by a lot of Republican politicians to sow divisions, to deepen the divide as an effort to motivate their supporters. \xc2\xa0Again, in the short term, that may be a useful political tactic for one politician or another. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the country. \xc2\xa0And as the President has previously observed, he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that it is not at all going to play well in a general election.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when he said that he would not support somebody who was spouting that kind of rhetoric, was that a direct message to Paul Ryan, who had just spoken, and who has not said that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support, say, Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is a direct message to other leaders in the Republican Party about how their leading status -- either as an elected official in the party, or as an elected official of the country -- gives them a certain set of responsibilities. \xc2\xa0And that means standing up and speaking out against efforts to target minorities and women and those with disabilities, and religious minorities, like Muslims. \xc2\xa0Leaders have that responsibility. \xc2\xa0They do have a responsibility to speak out. \xc2\xa0And they can do it in their own way. \xc2\xa0Everybody has to choose sort of the way that they feel is appropriate to do so. \xc2\xa0But there is no denying the responsibility that leaders in this country have to speak out and speak against those who are seeking to divide the country, particularly when it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than a cynical, selfish attempt to motivate one\xe2\x80\x99s own political supporters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, so Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pull troops out of Syria, are you saying that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a surprise then? \xc2\xa0I know that you were careful about saying no direct heads up there. \xc2\xa0But you\'ve been asked a couple of times. \xc2\xa0Was this a surprise to the White House? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the Russians did not give the United States advance direct notice of their plans. \xc2\xa0But beyond that, I don\'t have much to say.</p>\n<p>\n\tJuliet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just along the theme that you were just -- Mitch McConnell just told reporters that he told Trump in a conversation it \xe2\x80\x9cmight be a good idea to condemn that,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to violence, \xe2\x80\x9cand discourage it no matter what the source is.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0To what extent do you feel like Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s effort to reach out directly to Trump and talk about this is a sign of exactly what you\'ve been asking Republican leaders to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what is true is that it is hard, on the one hand, to say that this kind of violence, or those political tactics, or that divisive rhetoric is worthy of condemnation, and then on the other hand say that you believe that person is the best man or woman to lead the United States of America. \xc2\xa0There is more than a little tension in that position, and that is a tension that Senator McConnell and other leading Republicans across the country are going to have to work to resolve.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What you\'re coming very close to saying, Josh, and you alluded to it yesterday, coming off of my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries \xc2\xa0-- it sounds like the President is really the number-one leader in this country and there is one moral leader in this country. \xc2\xa0And when you factor in everything that he\xe2\x80\x99s come up to and said, almost all the way up to this point -- taken the fact that our allies have always been fascinated by our U.S. elections -- \xc2\xa0they\'re not like in Europe. \xc2\xa0They\'re not parliamentary, completely different. \xc2\xa0They don\'t understand it. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s beguiling, although they\'re fascinating. \xc2\xa0And 2008 was hugely popular especially for European media. \xc2\xa0The leaders in Europe now have gone from fascination to fearfulness. \xc2\xa0And they are afraid that a Donald Trump presidency would render this country unrecognizable to them. \xc2\xa0And I know the President says he trusts the American people that that won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, but really there is a lot of fear out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat can the President do? \xc2\xa0And has the President had any conversations with his friends, with his allies, to abate some of that fear that they may have that this country will go on to a completely different direction as the Europeans and as our allies around the world think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have any details of private presidential conversations to share from here. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s one aspect of our question that I do think warrants some response, which is that there is something unique about the President of the United States, which is that the President, whoever he or she is, is the one elected official in the United States that has a national constituency, the one leader in the United States that\'s elected by every voter across the country is the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that does invest in the presidency, regardless of who is in the office, a set of responsibilities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has embraced his responsibility to do things like stand up for basic American values. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s done that here at home, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done that around the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the thing that I wanted to note is it\xe2\x80\x99s not just our political leaders that are moral leaders in this country. \xc2\xa0There are other people who are in positions of authority and positions of power, and other people who are looked to for their perspective, and in some cases for their moral view. \xc2\xa0So this is not just responsibility of people who are in elected office, or people who have chosen to pursue the profession of politics. \xc2\xa0The President has often talked about how the most important role in our democracy is citizen and that there is a civic responsibility that we all have to ensure the continued success and vibrancy of our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that certainly goes to a lot of what the President was talking about in his speech in Springfield that he gave last month, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that our government and the leaders of our government live up to the expectations of our citizens. \xc2\xa0The President certainly takes that responsibility quite seriously.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I may, it seems the President has another role beside Commander-in-Chief, et cetera, chief executive, and that seems to be the consoler-in-chief or the moral leader-in-chief. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has in the past taken the bully pulpit -- whatever you may call it -- and made that kind of a strong reference and commitment to that. \xc2\xa0And in this time, when the world is really watching, there is a lot of concern that this country is not going in the direction that the President would, in fact, want it to.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that I think part of what motivates the President to make comments like those you saw today are his sense of our country\xe2\x80\x99s values and the moral obligations that the leaders of this country have to stand up for those values. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something the President feels quite strongly about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, what is the White House reaction to the example of bipartisanship yesterday when the House voted unanimously on a resolution finding the Islamic State guilty of genocide?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mark, applying the label of genocide as a policy matter is one that has significant legal implications. \xc2\xa0And that is why there are attorneys at the State Department who have now for quite some time been closely examining the use and application of that term to the situation inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0That is not a small matter. \xc2\xa0It\'s one that the attorneys at the State Department take quite seriously, and it\'s one that we are keenly focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore generally, though, it\'s important for people to understand that the President has already taken -- the President has already ordered military action out of concern for religious minorities who have been or could potentially be victimized by ISIL. \xc2\xa0And that includes not just Yazidis but also Christians. \xc2\xa0We know that ISIL has targeted Christian populations. \xc2\xa0We know that ISIL has targeted Yazidi populations in both Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0And the President has ordered military action against ISIL to try to protect those religious minorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this question about the label of genocide is an important one, and I\'m not in any way seeking to downplay its significance. But I can tell you that the President has already ordered aggressive, robust action to try to protect religious minorities who are in the crosshairs of ISIL fighters. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve done so with some success. \xc2\xa0But we continue to be concerned about religious minorities in that region of the world, including Christians, and we\'re going to continue to take steps to try to protect them even as the legal work about a genocide designation continues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the House vote in any way force the administration\xe2\x80\x99s hand to a similar finding that the House came to yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t looked carefully at the resolution and I haven\'t spoken to our attorneys about this. \xc2\xa0But my understanding is, no, that the work of the attorneys at the State Department will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0With the President talking about the vulgar rhetoric on the campaign trail these days, some people online are pointing out that when he was running against Senator McCain eight years ago, Senator Obama once said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf they bring a knife to the fight we bring a gun, because from what I understand, folks in Philly like a good brawl.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I know it was eight years ago, but how is that any different from what\xe2\x80\x99s going on today on the campaign trail?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Dave, that that would be one example -- I think that you have cited one example of something \xc2\xa0-- I haven\'t spoken to the President about this, so I\'ll let him speak for himself, but I suspect that he would include that in the category of what he described today as some intemperate remarks -- or intemperate words that we regret. \xc2\xa0The President confirmed that he can certainly recall some intemperate words that he can regret. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if that would fall in the category, but I suspect that it might.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, I think I would hasten to point out that seeking to denigrate women or minorities or people with disabilities or Muslims or people in the other political party in rather colorful fashion is quite a bit different in tenor and tone and objective than the comment that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just read.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Talking about bringing a gun to a fight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Dave, maybe that\'s the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that expression. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s an expression that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'ve heard it --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay, so then you understand why that might be different than somebody who stands in front of a stage of thousands of roaring people and suggests that somehow Muslims or people with disabilities or other minorities are responsible for the problems that are plaguing America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When the President made a comment like that all those years ago then, does he still feel he has the moral authority to tell other candidates how to behave on the campaign trail?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think he feels a moral responsibility as the President of the United States and as a citizen of this country to stand up for our values, and to make clear that the kind of divisive, hateful rhetoric that we see from multiple Republican candidates, not just one of them, is entirely inappropriate and entirely consistent with the core values of our country that we love.</p>\n<p>\n\tLauren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following up on Jim, has the President spoken to Secretary Kerry about this issue? \xc2\xa0And if so, what is he feeling about the March 17th -- about meeting the March 17th deadline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\'t speak to any specific presidential conversations with the Secretary of State. \xc2\xa0The President is obviously aware that the State Department is engaged in this effort to make a legal determination about the use of the term, genocide. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know -- frankly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually even know whether or not this is a process that should be walled off and done independently, or if this is something that the President has been briefed on. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take this sort of legal determination lightly. \xc2\xa0He believes that it\'s important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he also has not allowed that important ongoing work about the determination -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not allowed that work to prevent him from taking concrete steps and ordering concrete military action to protect religious minorities that we know are being victimized by ISIL, including Christians, in that region of the world that are minorities and that are being attacked for their religion. \xc2\xa0And we do know -- and the President has restated this principle on a number of occasions -- that an assault on one individual because of their religion is an affront on all people of faith. \xc2\xa0And that\'s not just something that the President says when he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering a speech, it\'s actually a principle that he believes in and a principle that he believes is worth fighting for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the omnibus bill that the President signed in December, it said that he had 90 days to make a decision -- when he signed it, he had 90 days to make a decision. \xc2\xa0That brings us to March 17th to declare if it is genocide or not. \xc2\xa0Will that be the case? \xc2\xa0Will that decision happen on the 17th?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For the update on the timing I\'d refer you to the State Department. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two brief questions. \xc2\xa0First, a few weeks ago, following the death of Mr. Mikhail Lesin, the former press secretary of President Putin and founder of Russian Television and other media outlets -- you said you had heard of it, but had no opinion. \xc2\xa0Since then, there\xe2\x80\x99s been an autopsy that said that he died from a blow to the back of his head. \xc2\xa0This has been widely publicized. \xc2\xa0Is this something the administration has any opinion on at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is a situation that continues to be investigated by local law enforcement authorities. \xc2\xa0I understand that the Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington, D.C. is continuing to investigate that crime that may have occurred here in Washington. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re taking a close look at it. \xc2\xa0*I know that the FBI has offered its assistance in that investigation. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any comment on it beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\t*[The Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department is leading the investigation of the death of Mikhail Lesin. The FBI is not currently involved in the investigation.]</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Hatch said in a speech on Friday, discussing the Supreme Court appointment and the controversy about whether the outgoing President should make the appointment, that Justices Bryor and Alito have both pointed out that the Court got along very well with eight members, and they cited the extended absence of Justice Robert Jackson in 1945 thru \xe2\x80\x986 to be prosecutor at the Nuremburg hearings. \xc2\xa0That would seem to contradict the administration\xe2\x80\x99s case that you needed nine justices on the Court and needed to fill a vacancy promptly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When you say the administration\xe2\x80\x99s case, are you referring to the Reagan administration\xe2\x80\x99s case, because they prosecuted this case pretty aggressively. \xc2\xa0President Reagan, back in November of 1987, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI would also hope that the Senate acts expeditiously so that the highest court in the land is able to conduct its business with the full complement of nine justices.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t just make that case once. \xc2\xa0Four days later, he repeated and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery day that passes with the Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people\xe2\x80\x99s business in that crucially important body.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the case that we have made for the Senate to act promptly to consider and confirm the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court is entirely consistent with the case that President Reagan made back in 1987.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so you say that that takes precedent over the absence of Justice Jackson and the yearlong vacancy of two nominees in 1970?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0John, what I\'m just saying is that -- first of all, you had to go back to 1970 in order to find that example. \xc2\xa0Because -- let me do the math real quick -- 46 years since, we\'ve never had a vacancy on the Supreme Court that has had an impact on two different terms. \xc2\xa0And the fact is that President Reagan made a forceful case about why that was an important situation for us to avoid. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim, did you have anything before we go? \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Thanks a lot, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you said yesterday you\xe2\x80\x99d let us know today about the absentee ballot.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that both the President and the First Lady voted absentee in the Illinois Democratic primary. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How did they vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'ll let them decide if they want to disclose who they voted for. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M.
