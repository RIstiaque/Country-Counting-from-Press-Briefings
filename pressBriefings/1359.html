<h1>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 5/5/10</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>See below for answers to questions (marked with an asterisk) posed in the briefing that required follow up.</p>\n<p>*No. The new security protocols that superseded the emergency measures put in place after Christmas are in place because they are stronger and more effective than requiring additional screening for everyone from certain countries.\xc2\xa0 The new measures apply to every individual traveling to the United States, from every country, not just people from certain countries. That original emergency measures were a useful short-term fix, but the threats we face are evolving, and because the new protocols are intelligence and threat-driven, they are flexible and can evolve in real time in a way that ensures we\xe2\x80\x99re putting into secondary screening individuals most likely to pose a threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>**While the FBI and other law enforcement agencies already receive notification when a person on a terror watch-list seeks to buy a gun and are committed to vigorously investigating such cases, many people are legitimately concerned that existing law still allows some people on watch-lists to buy guns. The Justice Department is reviewing its options for addressing this issue and for working with Congress to resolve it.</p>\n<p>***I\'m not going to get into any detail about a pending criminal case.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, in general, in national security cases the President and Brennan routinely receive briefings on pertinent information to keep fully abreast of developments and ensure inter-agency cooperation and follow-up action as appropriate.\xc2\xa0 This is done through established mechanisms and in a way that ensures the integrity of the judicial and criminal process.</p>\n<p>12:43 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Take us away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on the Times Square case.\xc2\xa0 The requirement now that airlines check the no-fly list within two hours of an update instead of 24 hours -- is that being done because of the Times Square case and the fact that the suspect actually did get on an airplane?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s being done because a review of the situation finds that an airline is required every 24 hours to check the no-fly list.\xc2\xa0 The suspect\xe2\x80\x99s name was entered a little after noon I believe on Monday; therefore, though on the no-fly list the airline didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to check necessarily at that point, the new rules require that that happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody has been added as a risk to the no-fly list.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say, again, as we said yesterday, the reason there are redundancies in the system is to allow for -- is to ensure that there are many mechanisms that would allow you to prevent somebody from flying -- which is what happened in this case.\xc2\xa0 The CBP takes a locked manifest that\'s required to be filed 30 minutes before a flight with people that are on the plane -- that was checked against that list and the individual was removed from the plane.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there consequences for an airline that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep someone who is on a no-fly list off an airplane?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DHS on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the specifics on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions, one on the Supreme Court and one on the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 On the Supreme Court, can you tell us how the meeting went this morning with Senators Kyl and Hatch?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a readout on the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know that the meetings were a result of conversations that the President had on the phone over the past several weeks with both senators.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that the Supreme Court came up and was part of that discussion.\xc2\xa0 I also would assume that other issues were covered in each one of those meetings.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that the list has been narrowed, and if so, to how many?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into characterizing where we are in the process, except to say that the President is in the midst of reviewing a number of very impressive candidates to pick one and announce that in due course.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the oil spill, Senator Reid has said he would support a cap for liability of $10 billion.\xc2\xa0 Is that a number that the White House would support, as well?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think $10 billion was in the legislation that Senator Menendez and others introduced on Monday.\xc2\xa0 After I got the question here about the $75 million cap for -- obviously the three exceptions that we talked about, willful misconduct, gross negligence and not paying attention to -- or in violation of federal regulations that removes that cap -- OMB was working on\xc2\xa0 -- in the process of working with the Hill on legislation to lift that cap.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten from them a number whether it would be $10 billion or something in that neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 We would be in favor of significantly -- lifting that cap, a cap put in place in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 so at least 20 years old.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t have a specific number?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific number.\xc2\xa0 I would reiterate, Jeff, that as the President said, BP is going to get a bill for the recovery, the cleanup and the damages cost.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The vice chair of the 9/11 Commission, Lee Hamilton, told ABC News yesterday that there was -- one of the -- among their recommendations was that the U.S. government crack down on the Border and Customs when it comes to people coming into this country and leaving this country.\xc2\xa0 And he said the first part of that has largely been done, but the last part of it has not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When people leave?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we don\'t -- nobody has to show papers as they leave the country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s different in a lot of other Western countries.\xc2\xa0 Other than this new TSA regulation when it comes to airlines checking their manifest and checking updates on the no-fly list, is the administration considering looking at this as a weakness?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with -- obviously a couple of people that we have here worked on the 9/11 Commission and with Lee Hamilton, somebody the President is fond and familiar with.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on what notion of what he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed and talked about we might also be looking at.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any response to reports that this individual Shahzad -- Faisal Shahzad, the Joint Terrorism Task Force did know about him, had been alerted about him years before?\xc2\xa0 Is there any new information you have about --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen that report.\xc2\xa0 Let me take a look at it and see where the best place is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any new information from Pakistan you can tell us about, Pakistani government?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I want to get into.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on Shahzad.\xc2\xa0 There was a Pakistani Taliban spokesman who spoke on CNN earlier today, Azam Tariq, who said that Shahzad is not a part of their organization, that there is not link.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason to believe that that is true, or that he does not have these kind of international terrorist links?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say this.\xc2\xa0 We are in the midst of an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, a big part of that ongoing investigation is to evaluate where he was and what he was doing during his time in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a lot of specifics on that at this point.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that have any credibility at all?\xc2\xa0 Or is at least the Justice Department looking into it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department is actively looking at, as well as others, looking at, as I said, the time he spent in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into -- I don\'t want to get into specifics.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a police source that tells CNN that Shahzad has a brother that\xe2\x80\x99s in Canada by the name of Amir Shahzad, an engineer.\xc2\xa0 Is that someone who the Justice Department or the administration is looking at?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me point you over to Justice on -- or FBI specifically on that and whether or not they would even in all honesty discuss that publicly.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you shed -- on the oil spill, can you shed any light on why BP was exempted from the environmental impact analysis?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a series of reviews that have to -- you have to go through in order to get drilling permits, the process by which was referenced in that article as part of the review that Secretary Salazar is undergoing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Times Square incident, as I understand it, when Shahzad returned from Pakistan in February, he was screened under the policy then in existence for people coming from certain countries to be screened, and that information turned out to be valuable.\xc2\xa0 If that policy had not been in place, and it is now not in place, then perhaps you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten this information.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confused on your timeline here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The policy was then in place that people coming from certain countries, including Pakistan, automatically were subjected to screening --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 14 countries.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I see.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I was confused on your --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He came from one of the 14 countries that automatically -- people were automatically subjected to additional screening, and some information was obtained that was valuable in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 In light of that, has any consideration been given to returning to that policy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC on that, and Brennan specifically.*</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other -- can you shed any light on why -- on how he slipped away from FBI surveillance?\xc2\xa0 Has that been --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, for specifics on FBI stuff, I would point you over to FBI.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Supreme Court, do you expect there will be more interviews?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that.\xc2\xa0 I think the process is ongoing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 People are asking why not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just -- the President is in the process of making a decision, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know the outcome of that in due time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he does these interviews, are they one-on-one?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, usually.\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say there\xe2\x80\x99s a one-on-one component, and then the Vice President has been involved separately, as are staff working on the process.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to let us into the process a little bit --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just gave you more than I probably meant to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'m following up on a roll, here.\xc2\xa0 What is the President trying to learn from these nominees?\xc2\xa0 Is it about legal topics, or is it like a get-to-know-you?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get much further than what I just talked about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Then last thing, yesterday we asked a lot of questions about the no-fly list, and it seemed as though you were saying that although there may have been a problem with the carrier, that essentially the system had functioned properly.\xc2\xa0 Now we hear about the new TSA changes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that more or less an acknowledgement that the system didn\xe2\x80\x99t work perfectly?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Savannah, the description that I gave you yesterday and the description which was a description of the events prevented the individual from flying.\xc2\xa0 The system is structured, again, so that in the event -- look, we have had -- I forget the exact facts, but we had -- you had names -- in the Christmas bombing you had names that were misspelled.\xc2\xa0 You build in redundancy to a security system to ensure that you don\'t have to have a silver bullet strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the system is set up so that a series of checks are provided that prevented this person from flying.\xc2\xa0 That having been said, the President will always look at in things that -- in any type of situation on a whole host of issues on what can be improved --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he specifically express concern about that issue, how did this guy get on?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the administration acted to ensure that if a 24-hour period wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a timely enough process for ticket purchase, that that be expedited -- updated in order to provide\xc2\xa0 -- I want to be careful to use \xe2\x80\x9cexpedited\xe2\x80\x9d because I\'m going to use it in a second -- that the list be refreshed for those that are put on in an expedited basis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But again, the no-fly list in many cases prevents you from purchasing a ticket.\xc2\xa0 But there are -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s another check through Customs and Border Protection in order to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re checking the manifest both coming and going of flights.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration view this incident as at all a consequence of its stepped-up aggressive activity in Pakistan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- I touched on this a little bit yesterday -- I think that since 9/11 our country has been under somewhat constant threat of terrorist activity.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you have covered and written about an increase in our tempo not just in Southeast Asia but in Africa and around the world.\xc2\xa0 As a result of that increased tempo, there has been a degradation in the command and control -- the upper command and control structure of al Qaeda, which I think has lessened their ability to plan and execute attacks of a spectacular nature like September 11.\xc2\xa0 That has led them to smaller, less sophisticated attacks using less capability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that is a function of part of that degradation in the senior al Qaeda leadership.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s caused -- that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s caused, again, some of these attacks to be done on a smaller scale.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of motives, do you think that this policy is at all fomenting a sense of radicalism among some people who may not otherwise have been interested in this activity?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to generalize in the sense of necessarily, based on the pending investigation, attributing that to this individual without something more concrete.\xc2\xa0 Again, I touched on yesterday there are those that seek to do us harm that are upset about the increased -- our increased presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 So I think there could be a whole host of those -- a whole host of those types of purported explanations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, just to follow up on Savannah\xe2\x80\x99s question about the Supreme Court, I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re reluctant to just tell us what the President is hoping to achieve, what the general topics are that he --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to achieve in the interviews the selection of the best Supreme Court justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to tell us a little bit more about his thought process as he goes about that very important task?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll explain that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a little more open about this.\xc2\xa0 Have you been chastised somewhere along the way for speaking out?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m no longer -- no, I just -- Chip, the truth is each day we -- as I said here yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into when or where or if we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do this today.\xc2\xa0 I said that\xe2\x80\x99s probably only going to cut down marginally on the number of times I get asked on e-mail whether we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it that day.\xc2\xa0 Sure enough, it happened this morning.\xc2\xa0 I get it.\xc2\xa0 I just am not going to get a whole lot further.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he close to a decision?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hmmm.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if those little morsels help or just lead you to many more questions that I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They do.\xc2\xa0 They actually do.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t you think like every hour he\xe2\x80\x99s closer to a decision?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Every minute.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did Jake say?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just chronologically.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake likes my tie.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the Christmas Day incident, the President used the words \xe2\x80\x9csystemic failure.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Would you put this suspect\xe2\x80\x99s ability to plan a bomb and almost get away from the country in the same category as a systemic failure?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand -- and I would point you to what Commissioner Kelly said yesterday -- the time elapsed from what happened -- the attempt in Times Square to having this terrorist in custody was done over an extraordinarily rapid time period.\xc2\xa0 I think the seamlessness with which federal, state and local authorities worked together, as Commissioner Kelly said, is something that we have, in all of these investigations over -- I think this is true over many administrations -- you strive for.\xc2\xa0 So I think in many ways, Peter, we want to celebrate the success of, rightly so, of what law enforcement was able to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That having been said, as I said here yesterday, the President uses any opportunity to evaluate whether we\xe2\x80\x99re doing -- whether what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is as effective as it can be, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll change whatever needs to be changed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as grave, say, as a systemic failure, would you concede then there were some failures that allowed both the planning of the bomb and his ability to re-enter the U.S. and plant this bomb and almost get away -- there were a number of failures?\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at is, is the President going to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would just ask you to be more specific about each one of your\xc2\xa0 -- I don\'t want to try to parse what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, but I don\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, the guy left the United States.\xc2\xa0 He came back from Pakistan, and he was interviewed when he came back, because that policy was allowed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They had certain details about him.\xc2\xa0 He was able to drive into Times Square, plant this bomb --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not the police commissioner for New York.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not the mayor of New York.\xc2\xa0 I honestly don\'t know what would prevent somebody from driving into Times Square. I don\'t --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, drive into Times Square, fine.\xc2\xa0 But to -- this guy had a background.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think, Peter, you\xe2\x80\x99re intimating that somehow this guy was in a whole lot of databases prior to coming back that would lead you to believe that he was likely to crudely assemble something like this.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just not sure the proof would bear that out.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to order the same scale of a review that he ordered after the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there was a -- the President had a regularly scheduled terrorism threat briefing that he has on a weekly basis.\xc2\xa0 That was yesterday.\xc2\xa0 They discussed this in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 It took place while we were -- while I was out here briefing, so I was not in attendance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say, as I said just a few minutes ago and yesterday, the President will ask that all aspects of and steps be reviewed to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re as effective as we possibly can, even as we -- even as we\xe2\x80\x99re thankful that this individual in a very short period of time was arrested and is now being questioned.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think what I\'m getting at, Robert, is, is it going to be the same sort of date-certain, deadline review that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I had not heard the President or John say that, no.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen the language of the Dodd-Shelby amendment that\xe2\x80\x99s going to end \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have -- I think either we have seen or are in the process of reviewing some of that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously what we have been able to look at appears to preserve one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s core principles, and that is that never again should the taxpayers of this country be on the hook for the reckless irresponsibility of big banks or Wall Street.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you endorsing it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to look at it to ensure -- to evaluate all of it.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think one of the big things in it appears to be the dropping of the fund that, as you all know, was not in our original proposal.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the administration seek legislation that would allow the government to block firearm sales to people that are on the terror watch list?**\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw Mayor Bloomberg testify to that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for guidance if we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a position on that bill or not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get back to us on that, Robert?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the White House believe it was a mistake for this categorical exemption to be granted to BP for Deepwater Horizon?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking into presently?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say -- as the President asked Secretary Salazar to undertake a 30-day review of what happened, that would certainly be part of the process under which he would evaluate it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed Markey said yesterday -- I\'m quoting him here directly -- \xe2\x80\x9cI\'m of the opinion that boosterism breeds complacency and complacency breeds disaster.\xc2\xa0 That, in my opinion, is what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s saying there was something complacent about the federal regulators, meaning Minerals Management Service, dealing with this particular granting of the exemption.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll be honest with you, Major, I think it would be premature to know -- I\'m unaware that we know exactly what happened, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on that until we had a sense of exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- happened?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it\xe2\x80\x99s the -- I mean, again, you heard Secretary Hayes and others say that these -- that there were individual inspections of blowout preventers and rigs very recently.\xc2\xa0 So I think that -- I think I\'d wait until we had something more concrete from Secretary Salazar as to making a determination on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say, though, that would certainly be part of, as I said, his review.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some have noted that while senator and while running for President, Senator Obama received $77,000 in contributions from BP.\xc2\xa0 Taking note of that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 From employees.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From employees, and also the BP PAC.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not -- as a senator, he received PAC contributions; obviously not as a candidate.\xc2\xa0 To any who might see that as a part of this equation, you would say what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Receiving money and a regulatory decision at the Interior Department during his presidency.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that\xe2\x80\x99s silly and ridiculous.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Mayor Bloomberg coming over here, or Commissioner Kelly, since they\xe2\x80\x99re in town, to update the President on anything?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m -- I mean, obviously Commissioner Kelly was with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But I am unaware that he\xe2\x80\x99s coming over here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reaction to Obey not seeking reelection?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just saw that before I came out, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to look through it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on Savannah\xe2\x80\x99s question, yesterday you said there obviously is a carrier element in all this.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t, right?\xc2\xa0 They were not under an obligation, under the old TSA rules, to check the no-fly list?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we want to do is prevent -- you add a name onto the list in an expedited -- in a way in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody who is of great interest and could possibly pop up someplace like this trying to leave.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do is ensure that there was a mechanism in place that requires that that list be continually changed -- again, the requirement that an airline do it every 24 hours -- they could do it more frequently, but they have to do it at least that frequently.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it seemed common sense to the President and the administration to simply put in place the requirement that that be done every two hours if somebody is added to that list.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds, though, like they complied with the old rules?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume they\xe2\x80\x99ll go back and look through that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, this was supposed to be sort of a jobs theme week at one point, where you had the Business Council speech, go to New Jersey today, jobs numbers come out Friday.\xc2\xa0 And as has happened before, external events interfere and then you have all these other things that are on your plate -- the \xe2\x80\x9cmust pass\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cwould like to pass\xe2\x80\x9d legislation, when it\xe2\x80\x99s health care and now it\xe2\x80\x99s financial regulation, and SCOTUS nomination.\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t able to convey a sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s jobs, jobs, jobs here at the administration?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me give you two answers.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in any way shape or form that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that financial reform has a lot to do with strengthening the economy and jobs.\xc2\xa0 As a result of reckless decisions that Wall Street and big banks made, we lost 8.5 million of them.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t divorce those two issues.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, look, the nature of the presidency and the nature of being the leader of a country as big as the United States means that a lot of things can happen at the same time.\xc2\xa0 I could not necessarily have predicted all of what the President is dealing with over the past four or five days, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But you always, in the back of your mind, know that that\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say, though, that the President -- even as he works on the oil spill or on terrorism -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t making, as I said earlier, progress on selecting somebody for the Supreme Court, or speaking to the Business Council about strengthening our regulatory structure in order to strengthen our foundation for a stronger economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Americans associate financial regulation with job creation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they understand that because of the reckless decisions made by some big banks on Wall Street, that this economy got screwed up to the point where many of them lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think they can -- I think they definitely see that.\xc2\xa0 I think they understand that the economic situation that they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with -- whether it is with credit card debt, or whether their housing prices went down because their neighbor got a loan that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully understand all of the components of -- I think that very much impacts their personal economic situation to the point where -- I guess I don\'t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s all quite as segmented as many might think it is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just close on this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean the House a long time ago passed its $150 billion jobs bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so in the Senate there\xe2\x80\x99s now a welter of bills in different pieces to be smaller.\xc2\xa0 And the upshot is nothing is really happening.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration doing to sort of shake something out?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously financial reform is on the floor at the moment.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on individual things like the retrofitting and the Home Star legislation that we think will have a positive benefit, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a sense of where we stand on Friday with the jobs market.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, immigration reform -- is the President going to talk about that in any specificity tonight?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He will.\xc2\xa0 He will.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he going to take the opportunity to clear up what -- to set the record straight on what he said on Air Force One, which has been interpreted as saying it ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen this year?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, and having looked at it and having talked to him about that, I don\'t -- I think the President said that immigration is a very hard issue that Congress might not finish this year.\xc2\xa0 I happen to believe that -- well, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that would disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it is a big and complicated issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in the past, it takes Democrats and Republicans, even in the best of circumstances, to get this done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has met with Senator Schumer and Graham, who were working on a bipartisan proposal.\xc2\xa0 They asked him to do specific things to move immigration reform forward, which he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 So I think he will discuss the need to continue to make progress on that even, as Jackie said, in a very busy legislative time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to use the words \xe2\x80\x9cthis year\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he will -- well, let me -- I\'ll give you a little preview once I get back and read over the direct remarks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- well, the suspect in the Times Square incident, they said yesterday, was talking, was being cooperative.\xc2\xa0 Does the summary of what he has told interrogators come to the President or John Brenner?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think John likely gets all of that information.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll double-check.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that appropriate for the investigative material from this suspect to be shared?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with John and see.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President gets from a whole host of entities in the daily briefing each day an update of where we are.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not we get into the specifics of -- I will -- let me ask, John.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly.\xc2\xa0 He gets a -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of stuff in that office, I know that.***</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David Obey\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to seek reelection, is that another sign that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a really bad year for incumbents?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I simply saw the alert that he\xe2\x80\x99s not running.\xc2\xa0 I have not looked at what the reasoning is, what his personal reasoning is for not seeking reelection.\xc2\xa0 I said this a long, long time ago I think to a question that Chuck had asked, which is I think people make decisions about whether to run or not to run for a whole host of reasons.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that the political environment is part of that reason, but I don\'t think that I would in any way say that that is the only reason.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are a whole host of family and personal reasons that I -- in having dealt with candidates trying to make decisions about running for races that you certainly shift through.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as bomber is concerned, is there a message to be learned, or wakeup call, or you think the President -- time has come for the President to visit a local mosque?\xc2\xa0 Because I have been talking to many Pakistanis here in the Springfield area.\xc2\xa0 What they are saying is that because of this and many incidents where Pakistani nationals are being subjected to this issue, and they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid and scared of being targeted because many Pakistanis are good Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 You think the President should visit a local mosque?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly talk to scheduling and see if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as BP oil spill is concerned, was there any -- from the company or from the U.S. outside help or outside expert --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the State Department has fielded individual countries who have offered assistance in some way, shape or form, and are processing that through and getting that information to those at DHS and at the National Incident Command to ensure that any resources that can be helpful are used.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just following up on immigration, some of the advocates would like to see kind of a health care-style summit meeting at the White House with proponents and opponents of immigration to sort of work it through.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House open to that kind of summit meeting on the issue?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that directly here.\xc2\xa0 I would say, again, Peter, this is not an issue, as the President has seen in working on this issue in the Senate or as President, that is going to pass with the support of only one political party.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which there are, at least in the Senate, a tremendous number of, right now, Republican sponsors for that legislation.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- this is not going to pass only with one party\xe2\x80\x99s votes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President was asked by those on a bipartisan basis working on this issue to call five Republicans to seek their help, and I think that has moved -- partly moved the process along.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the White House had any success in bringing any Republicans onboard?\xc2\xa0 And does this issue -- does that effort continue even as we speak, or --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Obviously people are involved here, and those that the President reached out to, many of them said that they would begin to get involved in and look at the process of what is happening up on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Just need some clarification on the Gates letter and the White House statement issued last week.\xc2\xa0 Gates said in the letter that he strongly opposed any legislative action this year, and the White House * delaying implementation until after the DOD study.\xc2\xa0 Does this mean the President is ruling out endorsement of repeal this year as part of the Defense authorization?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that off the top of my head.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, Robert?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President potentially open to a scenario where Congress votes on repeal this year but delays implementation of repeal until the Defense Department study comes out?\xc2\xa0 In other words, deferring to the Department of Defense timeline on implementation of a repeal?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that, but I will get an update on whether that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have heard from the Hill or others around town about.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to Secretary Gates recently about \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on several topics really fast.\xc2\xa0 Immigration -- some are saying that -- on the Hill, Democrats on the Hill are saying, realistically, it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that will have to be taken up in a second term if this President does have a second term.\xc2\xa0 What is the realistic timeline to pick up on immigration?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has begun work on it this year.\xc2\xa0 April, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think as a result of a lot of things, not the least of which is the law in Arizona, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about not working on this -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about not making progress on this until 2013.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I have not heard that as anything that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed in here.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s saying that in Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some high-ranking Democrats.\xc2\xa0 They said it Saturday night, matter of fact.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether to probe on that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put it -- I\'m putting it down.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m slowly walking away.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you go and ask another question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but that was -- no, it was a -- they seriously said it.\xc2\xa0 But moving on -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I love that you just had to get your last word in that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t probe you on the fact that at some after-party\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it was not an after-party, not an after-party.\xc2\xa0 It was at the -- anyway, moving on, moving on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Come on, even the look on your face, you knew when you had said that you had sort of got caught, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you move on.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 When I asked you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As much fun as I was having.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to fall into it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Anyway, when I asked you was he -- the President, closer to making a decision, you said yes.\xc2\xa0 That leads me to believe that maybe he is whittling down his list.\xc2\xa0 Am I correct in assuming that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to move the public process that much more forward, except to say what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here in terms of I do think he\xe2\x80\x99s getting closer, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, and on HBCUs, this weekend begins the weekend where the President and the First Lady give commencement addresses, and then the rest of the -- a large portion of the administration will be delivering commencement addresses to many of the 105 HBCUs.\xc2\xa0 Why now this plethora of administration officials going to HBCUs to deliver commencement addresses versus last year when the President and Mrs. Obama did not deliver any? And there was a concern within the HBCU community that many of the young HCBU students got out and voted for this President, and it was just nothing last year.\xc2\xa0 And now it\xe2\x80\x99s an overwhelming show at commencement season.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure that -- I don\'t have a list of all the commencements that administration officials did last year.\xc2\xa0 Suffice to say, April, the President is not going to be, and the First Lady, aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to do every college or university every year.\xc2\xa0 We select a small number for the President and the First Lady each year in order for him to talk about a whole host of different topics, and I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looking -- I know both of them are looking forward to this weekend.</p>\n<p>Glen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on immigration, one on BP.\xc2\xa0 House Republican conference chairman, Mike Pence, today said that the people of the Gulf of Mexico \xe2\x80\x9cdeserve better\xe2\x80\x9d than the response to the oil spill, and sort of characterized the administration\xe2\x80\x99s positioning of equipment and vessels there as being slow.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is as badly informed -- it sounds as badly informed as I think it is.\xc2\xa0 Glen, there was an explosion on the night of April 20th that was responded to by the Coast Guard, looking for those that had been injured and those that were missing.\xc2\xa0 The morning after the explosion, Secretary Salazar deployed Deputy Secretary Hayes to the region to assist the coordination and response and provide hourly updates to Secretary Salazar about what was happening.</p>\n<p>On the 22nd when the rig sank, the National Response Team was activated, and later that day, the President convened a meeting in the Oval Office with all of those involved.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an 18-page document on our website about all that was done.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d be -- what exactly in that response did Mr. Pence find lacking?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Essentially he was just talking -- I think it was just generally sort of the positioning of vessels to deal with the spill, as opposed to the search and rescue.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, when the first thing happens when you find who is on the rig and you try to get them to medical safety -- get them some medical care and find those that are missing.\xc2\xa0 So is that the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s his whole thing?\xc2\xa0 Interesting -- okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Immigration -- quick immigration question.\xc2\xa0 The Phoenix Suns -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99re aware -- have decided to use \xe2\x80\x9cLos Suns\xe2\x80\x9d on their jersey.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of that?\xc2\xa0 And do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see more expressions of that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think somebody at a higher pay level will probably talk about that a little later on today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who is that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Bo.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bye, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, wait one more question --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is speaking in two minutes, Sam, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss a word.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n1:28 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
