Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:15 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Mr. Knoller, did you have a request?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Any chance your briefing might be interrupted by a joint appearance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Uhh -- no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not the historical record, seriously -- I mean, to view them together?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen other Presidents and those that they defeated in presidential contests together.\xc2\xa0 Why not something for the historical record -- visually or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\'s at least some chance we\'ll release a photograph, which will go into the historical record.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a private lunch, and we\'re going to leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s for lunch?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, lunch.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the menu, but I bet it was -- and is -- quite tasty, because they know how to prepare very find meals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a definite on stills?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me look into that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know yet.\xc2\xa0 I\'m pretty sure we\'ll release something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any plans for him to come to the stakeout at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'d have to ask his assistants or whoever might have an answer for you on that because that\'s not our decision.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd since we actually never said it, we\'re referring to the fact that the President of the United States is having lunch as we speak with Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 And I have, and will have, no readout of that lunch, since it\'s ongoing, from here today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI have no other announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 So I will go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on this, Jay -- did the White House send a car for Mitt Romney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that we did, but I don\'t know the answer to that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner said today that there\'s been no substantive progress made between Republicans and the White House over the past two weeks on fiscal cliff negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Is that an assessment that the White House agrees with, that there\'s been no progress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a couple things on that.\xc2\xa0 In the summer of 2011, there was the possibility of reaching what was then called a grand bargain, and the obstacle that prevented that was, in the end, the refusal of Republicans to go along with the fundamental principle that a deficit reduction needed balance and it needed to include real, tangible revenues; that the wealthy ought to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 Since that time, and I think in an accelerated sense, in the last several weeks, we have seen progress.\xc2\xa0 We have seen that obstacle partly overcome because Republicans have acknowledged that revenue must be part of a balanced approach to deficit reduction, and that that revenue must come from those who can afford it most.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\'re not there yet because the remaining obstacle here is<br/>\n\t-- on the revenue side, is that Republicans -- at least Republican leaders -- have yet to accept the essential fact that in order to achieve the kinds of revenue that are necessary for a balanced proposal, balanced plan, rates on the top 2 percent, the wealthiest earners in this country, are going up.\xc2\xa0 They have to go up.\xc2\xa0 The President will not sign any legislation that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for top earners in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis should not be news to anyone on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly not news to anyone in America who was not in a coma during the campaign season, because this was an explicit, repeated, and high-profile debate throughout the campaign.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then on the spending side, the President has put forward, in September of 2011 with his proposal to the so-called super committee, in his budget in February of 2012, very specific spending cuts, including savings from health care entitlement programs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen yet from Republicans is any movement, at least from Republican leaders, on the fundamental second stage of the obstacle that they need to clear, which is an acknowledgement that you cannot achieve the revenues unless rates go up.\xc2\xa0 Rates have to go up for wage earners, even as we absolutely, essentially, must sign into law tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that there is progress being made in the rhetoric or in perhaps the attitude of Republicans, but not actually in the negotiations themselves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that we have seen some important signs of recognition of what needs to be done, but we aren\'t there yet.\xc2\xa0 Once the acknowledgement is made that rates need to be part of this, I don\'t think it\'s very difficult to -- or all that difficult to achieve the kind of balanced compromise that the President seeks and that the American people seek, because there are specific cuts already on the table that would make up<br/>\n\t-- that would be the foundation of a discussion about the spending side of this equation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we remain optimistic that this can get done.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s principles are clear.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s not like we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have this discussion and debate for the past year; we did -- in fact, beyond that.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that the position that some held that rates would never go up, that it was more important that millionaires and billionaires get a tax cut than we get a comprehensive deal for the sake and health of our economy -- that that was a position that was held.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not plausible anymore.\xc2\xa0 And the American people have spoken and the President has been very clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing on this.\xc2\xa0 You say that the President has put forward specific spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Boehner said again this morning that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any plan.\xc2\xa0 Where do they fall on this when they actually talk in person, what they did last night or what they did on Saturday?\xc2\xa0 Has the President said that he\'s put forward spending cuts and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t plan to put forth any more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you asked.\xc2\xa0 This is available not just here but to everyone in the world who has an Internet connection. And I know things are done the old-fashioned way sometimes on Capitol Hill, but I believe they have electricity and Internet connections and they can get this.\xc2\xa0 This is an 85-page plan that is very detailed -- sorry, maybe 65, going on 70 -- that\'s very detailed and it outlines -- it\'s the President\'s Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction that was submitted in September of 2011.\xc2\xa0 It is of a piece with his budget that he put forward in February 2012.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd in terms of where we are missing specifics is anything specific, politically feasible, or substantial from the Republican side on revenues.\xc2\xa0 And while there has been progress of sorts on that subject, more needs to be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let me just say that we remain optimistic that we can get there.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important for the American people to know that we can get there.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear from the start that he understands that he will not get every item in this proposal or in his budget proposal, that compromise requires tough choices from all sides.\xc2\xa0 He\'s acknowledged that up front.\xc2\xa0 And in this proposal and others, he has made clear in great specificity the kinds of tough choices he\'s willing to make.\xc2\xa0 And he is willing to make more.\xc2\xa0 But a fundamental principle here that was much discussed and debated during the campaign is that broad deficit reduction on the scale that is essential requires asking the wealthiest to pay more, and it requires -- the only way to get the kind of revenue that we need in order to achieve that balance is for rates to go up for the wealthiest earners in America even as we ensure that tax cuts are extended for 98 percent of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President have plans to meet or speak with Speaker Boehner?\xc2\xa0 If not, at what point would that direct contact be appropriate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you saw reported that they spoke last night.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\'t got a new engagement to announce today. They spoke last night, they spoke over the weekend, they met prior to the President\'s trip to Asia, and I\'m sure they will speak again.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a specific timeframe for that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, Secretary Geithner and Rob Nabors from the White House are up on Capitol Hill right now having meetings on this subject, and that process will continue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the process that the President has been engaged in all week, in addition to the phone calls he\'s had, of engaging the broader American community beyond the halls of the Capitol is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 He\'s traveling to Pennsylvania tomorrow, as you know, to visit a company that would be affected adversely if Congress<br/>\n\tthe House were to decide not to extend tax cuts for the middle class -- because that is a very important part of this debate.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s very important -- contrary to suggestions that we heard a few days ago in this room -- that the President of the United States engage with the American people about these critical debates that affect their future.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate that leaders on Capitol Hill do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really, really important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s amazing if you look at some of the data out there about what the American people know about this debate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s quite substantial.\xc2\xa0 And they made clear -- at least a majority of them -- what path they prefer their leaders in Washington take, and that\'s a path of both compromise but a path of balance.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the path the President has proposed, and that\'s the path he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling in these days and weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things Speaker Boehner said this morning was that any increase in the debt limit would have to be matched by<br/>\n\tor exceeded by further spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the same kind of rhetoric that we heard in 2011.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that that is being used as leverage again in a way that could be damaging to the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I was struck by that myself.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 Asking that a political price be paid in order for Congress to do its job to ensure that the United States of America pays its bills and does not default for the first time in its history is deeply irresponsible.\xc2\xa0 It was deeply irresponsible in the summer of 2011, and it would be deeply irresponsible if we were to see that kind of approach taken again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President absolutely expects Congress to do its job.\xc2\xa0 And one of the jobs that Congress has is to make sure that the United States government pays its bills.\xc2\xa0 As the greatest economy and greatest country on Earth, we pay our bills.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President believes that it is entirely appropriate that Congress take action on this as part of an end-of-the-year deal, if you will, on the issues that confront us -- the fiscal cliff and broader deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It would be a terrible mistake and I think would earn deserved approbation from the American public if Congress were to try to travel that path again.\xc2\xa0 The harm done was done mostly to the American middle class.\xc2\xa0 We had our economy downgraded; we had consumer confidence plunge all because of this brinksmanship that is entirely inappropriate, and we hope we won\xe2\x80\x99t see that again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re looking for an agreement to raise the debt ceiling as part of the negotiations before the end of the year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In whatever manner it comes, it should be done soon and without drama.\xc2\xa0 But we cannot have the kind of situation where there was harm done even with the threat of default.\xc2\xa0 There was significant damage done to our economy, significant damage done to consumer confidence simply when the prospect of default was in the air in 2011, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow that to happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 South Korean newspapers yesterday were reporting that back in August there were senior members of the NSC that flew into Pyongyang and were meeting with the North Koreans to prevent them from doing any provocative actions before the elections in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 What can you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports, and they don\'t ring true to me, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back in October, there were similar reports out of North Korea that they met with members of the NSC and the CIA.\xc2\xa0 I mean North Koreans and South Koreans --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re citing reports I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen sourced to places I am not familiar with, so -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the sourcing is on that.\xc2\xa0 I would have to take your question.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a question I can answer because it is news to me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only place this meeting seems to be a secret is here in the U.S., which gives the impression that the President has some sort of domestic political consideration or fear --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99re making an editorial comment based on an article I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen, so I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you take the question and include it in the transcript?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will take the question and see what we find out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Politico has characterized the conversation between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner last night as \xe2\x80\x9ccurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the conversation?\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Twenty-eight minutes long is my understanding. It was -- I would actually echo what Speaker Boehner said in his remarks earlier today, which is that it was frank and direct and a good conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would agree with that characterization -- and it was also 28 minutes long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the debt ceiling fight, President Obama was criticized for not reaching out directly enough to congressional leaders.\xc2\xa0 Is his strategy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 During which fight?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the debt ceiling debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My God, they practically lived together down the hall here.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s the case, not during the debt ceiling crisis.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People said that there were not enough meetings between the President and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I recall, there was -- that doesn\'t ring true from the debt ceiling fight.\xc2\xa0 I think there were a lot of meetings, a lot of conversations, a lot of later reported on meetings that weren\'t even public at the time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m talking about one-on-one conversations.\xc2\xa0 Is his strategy any different?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So am I.\xc2\xa0 And they were numerous during the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 What I often get asked about and have been asked about subsequent to that was during the payroll tax cut discussion debate at the end of last year, and during the debate over whether or not we should allow rates for student loans to rise dramatically -- there were calls mostly from colleagues of yours here in this room for more and more meetings between the President and the Speaker to resolve these issues.\xc2\xa0 And of course, there were conversations between the White House and the Capitol in resolving these issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President also, very appropriately, went out into the country to make sure that the American people were engaged in this and that their voices were heard in this kind of debate.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what he\'s doing again -- because that\'s how it should be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In addition to going out -- going to Pennsylvania tomorrow, is part of his strategy to be in regular contact with Speaker Boehner, as he was last night?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has been less than 24 hours since they spoke.\xc2\xa0 Prior to that it was five days, four days, since Saturday I think they spoke.\xc2\xa0 In between that conversation and the meeting they had, the President traveled to three countries in Asia and there was a major American holiday.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d say that\'s pretty regular contact.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is my question -- is that a part of his strategy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a -- it\'s not a strategy.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s strategy is to reach a deal with Congress that embodies the principles that he has long espoused, which is to reduce our deficit in a responsible way that allows the economy to continue to grow and create jobs; that achieves that deficit reduction through broad balance that includes spending cuts, entitlement reform savings and revenues that come from those who can afford it most, the top 2 percent of earners in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he has put forward this proposal.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward his budget.\xc2\xa0 And so what his specific ideas are on these issues are well known and documented.\xc2\xa0 But he has also said, as he did in the aftermath of the election to you, that he understands that tough choices need to be made and he\'s, as he has demonstrated, willing to make them.\xc2\xa0 But there are principles here that he will not alter, and one of them is that revenues from top earners have to be part of this deal.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s what the American people believe.\xc2\xa0 It is what he believes.\xc2\xa0 It is what we have seen increasingly Republicans acknowledge, including -- increasingly, we\'ve seen Republicans acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen business leaders acknowledge that, because it\'s mathematically self-evident.\xc2\xa0 So we know where we need to go.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to continuing the discussion and reaching a deal, a deal that\'s good for the American people and good for the economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more on the lunch that President Obama is having with Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 One of Romney\'s former chief strategists, Stuart Stevens, wrote an op-ed in which he essentially suggests that Romney lost because minorities overwhelmingly voted for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Does that op-ed -- do the comments that Romney made in any way cloud or set a certain backdrop to this lunch?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, first of all.\xc2\xa0 I think campaigns are a tough business.\xc2\xa0 Debates are sharp, and in this case they were very substantive and important.\xc2\xa0 There is I think an event up in "Haavad," in Cambridge, tonight where a lot of these issues will be discussed by the two campaigns --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was just trying it out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Try "park" and "quarter" and "water."<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Paak the car, Haavad Yard.\xc2\xa0 But seriously, I think you know about this -- the top campaign officials from both sides have traditionally gotten together and had a discussion about what transpired at the campaign strategy level, so that -- I\'m sure we\'ll all take an interest in seeing that.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s been a lot of people who have effectively refuted the assertion you made about this race.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do that from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEd.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you mentioned the budget.\xc2\xa0 Republicans point out it was voted down unanimously and hasn\'t moved forward, but you quite correctly note there are spending cuts in there.\xc2\xa0 I guess my question would be, can you also hold up that budget, look in the camera and say, dear fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill, vote for, include some of these spending cuts in this deal to avoid the fiscal cliff?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s not what they\'re doing right now.\xc2\xa0 Should they include those?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- and I know that Democrats accept that there have -- that this has to be a balanced package that includes revenues and cuts -- and spending cuts, and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Senator Durbin said entitlement cuts should not be part of this.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, "this" is a loose, even though short, word, which is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said even as the fiscal cliff --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I think everybody understands that there are two parts, two pieces of this.\xc2\xa0 We have the deadlines bearing down on us related to automatic tax hikes that would occur and automatic across-the-board spending cuts that would occur if some sort of agreement isn\'t reached on that issue.\xc2\xa0 There is the broader issue, which reflects the President\'s longstanding interest and oft-expressed interest in a big deal that achieves broadly $4 trillion in cuts and reduction that he believes ought to be part of this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn that broader context, absolutely, savings from health care entitlements need to be and will be part of it; other savings need to and will be part of it.\xc2\xa0 The President has already signed into law over a trillion dollars in non-defense discretionary spending cuts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when he said yesterday, "next year," you\'re saying clearly that this year --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I heard Speaker Boehner talk today about the framework that they -- I\'m just using his words, I\'m not reading out paper that they give us or meetings that we had with them, but just citing him -- he talked about a framework and a two-stage process.\xc2\xa0 And that may be how it works out.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to prejudge that because that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\'re negotiating.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the broader point is there are two elements to this that are linked:\xc2\xa0 One is the fiscal cliff and one is the broader deficit reduction package that the President seeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Finally, I would note there are colleagues in the back of the room who have been complaining about not getting enough questions.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you moving around.\xc2\xa0 Some of them asked me, as president of the association, to set rules on how many questions everyone gets.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t police people, but in the spirit of sharing the ball, I yield back the balance of my time and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to commend Ed for that.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll -- with that, I\'ll go to the back of the room.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ed.\xc2\xa0 I was going to ask about some Northeast lawmakers in particular are very anxious about getting a spending supplemental for the Hurricane Sandy disaster.\xc2\xa0 And when is the White House going to send that up, and do you know how much that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not have any detail for you.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously looking at the requests that have come in, studying them very closely.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s been enormously focused, as you know -- I was in a meeting with him earlier today where the discussion -- we spent some time talking about Hurricane Sandy and the lasting impact that that terrible storm has had on the residents of New Jersey and New York and some parts of Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 And so he remains focused on this.\xc2\xa0 He remains focused on ensuring that the federal team is doing everything it can to help with this effort in the Cabinet meeting.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know -- or maybe as you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but this was discussed -- also Shaun Donovan is leading a task force, at the President\'s request, for the continued efforts at the federal level to assist states and localities in response to this storm. So this is very much on the President\'s mind.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific number for you or anything about a supplemental at this time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would love to see quotes from the meeting -- or the phone call with Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 If not, can you characterize -- did the President say what you just said to the American people to the Speaker, that there will be tax rate increases on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll find that I won\'t read out the contents of conversations that the President has.\xc2\xa0 But I will say what the President\'s positions are, and I think it\'s fair to say that the President\'s positions are consistent in public and in private.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of the nature of and character of the phone call, I would echo what Speaker Boehner said, and he said that it was frank and direct and good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Mr. Romney here, one of his proposals that some Democrats seem to think makes a little bit of sense is capping deductions.\xc2\xa0 Where does the President stand on that specific issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you look at his plan and go to the revenue section in it, you\'ll notice that we talk a lot about rates.\xc2\xa0 And one of the points that I\'ve been making and others have been making is that you cannot get the kind of revenue that you need simply from capping deductions or closing loopholes without taxing the heck out of the middle class -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable for the President -- or without basically ending the charitable deduction or doing other things that would never fly on Capitol Hill, for good economic as well as political reasons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\'s that.\xc2\xa0 But the President has put forward as part of his revenue proposals caps on some deductions for top earners and closing of some loopholes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur point has always been that you need to do both, that rates need to go up for the wealthiest Americans -- and when we say go up, like this is not -- let\xe2\x80\x99s remember what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.\xc2\xa0 The top rates for earners that will happen when the Bush-era tax cuts expire for them are the rates that were in place in the 1990s when President Clinton was in office, rates that were decried by some of the leaders in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill at the time -- I mean, today\xe2\x80\x99s leaders who were members back then -- and yet, the result of the economic policies that were adopted in that period was the longest sustained economic expansion, peacetime, in our history; the creation of over 23 million jobs; the transformation of budget deficits into budget surpluses -- basically a record that I think most Americans would want to see happen again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo these are not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing extreme about asking millionaires and billionaires, wealthy Americans to pay at rates that were in place during the strongest economy of our lifetime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you got the rate hikes you\'re looking for, would the President agree to an overall cap of deductions for all Americans?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that we\xe2\x80\x99d have to do an -- I think I would point to -- there are ways to address caps on deductions and I think we proposed 28 percent for top earners, closing loopholes, some of them, like corporate jets and things like that, but closing loopholes.\xc2\xa0 One of the problems with the suggestion that you can achieve substantial revenues out of -- without touching rates is that you have to do Draconian things when it comes to deductions and loopholes that aren\xe2\x80\x99t economically wise or politically feasible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s why, when I talk about we need something that\'s realistic and mathematically sound, not just something that adds up on paper -- that\'s why the President is taking the approach he has had, which includes allowing the rates to rise for top earners, but also includes changes to our tax code -- deductions and loopholes -- that are plausible as well as revenue-producing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that on that phone call, the President did say to Speaker Boehner, there will be no deal without an increase on the tax rates for the wealthiest.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to read out the call.\xc2\xa0 My question is, is the President sticking to the Clinton rates?\xc2\xa0 You said it worked in that time. Does it have to be the Clinton rates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, without reading out the phone call, quoting any member of that -- participant in that phone call, I would say that there can be no deal without rates on top earners going up.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about his proposal and the revenues that would be part of that proposal that would result from and flow from extending tax cuts to the middle class and allowing rates to go back up to the Clinton levels for top earners, and then going to my earlier point, and that would then be coupled with other changes that would produce additional revenue -- changes to the tax code on capping deductions and closing loopholes for top earners.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGoing back to my first point with Julie, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any kind of proposal from the Republicans on rates -- there has not even been an acknowledgement from Republican leaders of the fundamental fact that rates have to go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to figure out where you guys are coming from, the offer here is Clinton rates for the top 2 percent, for the top two marginal rates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the deal.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an offer to make from the podium.\xc2\xa0 What is in the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, in this proposal and his budget, what he talked about repeatedly throughout the year, is that he will sign tomorrow a bill that would extend tax cuts for the middle class, and that he will not sign under any circumstances legislation that would keep rates where they are for the wealthiest Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but my point is -- you can speak hypothetically about 39.5 versus 39.6.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be realistic.\xc2\xa0 The realistic proposals that are on the table involve -- that create the kind of revenues absolutely essential for real balance in this proposal involve raising the rates -- letting the rates return to where they were.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBecause remember this whole thing about -- that we sort of got into the other day, maybe it was yesterday -- about whether we\xe2\x80\x99re asking people to vote for a tax hike -- no, we\xe2\x80\x99re just asking people not to vote for a tax cut for rich people.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re saying that we can\'t afford it economically, that the American people overwhelmingly don\'t support and that many -- increasing numbers of business leaders don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify one thing on a different topic so we can --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For people who are still curious about whether the President has an offer for Mitt Romney when they\'re meeting today, has something changed overnight?\xc2\xa0 Is the President offering Governor Romney a job?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really just don\'t have a readout on that.\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- but without giving any specifics, this was a conversation the President wanted to have with Governor Romney, as he mentioned I think the night of the election.\xc2\xa0 And there was not an agenda that involves that kind of proposal that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think that he\'s very interested in some of Governor Romney\'s ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure they will or have already compared experiences on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, it is -- there have only been 28 press secretaries, so it\'s a pretty -- but think about it, there aren\'t that many people who have been nominees for their party, right, there aren\'t that many people you can talk to who know what it\'s like to do what these two gentlemen did for the past year.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they\'ll probably talk a lot about that, which is I think will be very interesting for them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to follow, Jay, you said yesterday specifically there was no --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to follow on the fact that there have only been 29 press secretaries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said 28.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Twenty-eight prior to me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday there would be no ask.\xc2\xa0 You\'re not saying that as clearly today.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say it clearly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, there is no ask?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\'t -- I can\'t dictate what the President says, let alone what Governor Romney says, but I don\'t think that\'s what this conversation is about.\xc2\xa0 The President is very interested in his ideas and very appreciative that Governor Romney is here to have lunch with him. But beyond that, I think it\'s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What ideas does he like?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we talked -- the President mentioned that Governor Romney very successfully resuscitated and ran the Olympics in Salt Lake City.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an idea --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but I think Governor Romney certainly knows how to manage an operation like that.\xc2\xa0 And the President is -- as I know, because I\'ve sat in the room and heard him go into detail on this and get very passionate about it -- is very interested in creating greater efficiencies in this government, making it run better, making it more effective in the 21st century, because we have a lot of agencies and institutions that were created long ago and they can be improved upon.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s reflected in the proposal for government reorganization that the President put forward.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he can be pretty wonky about this stuff.\xc2\xa0 And somebody with Governor Romney\'s experience clearly would have insight into how to maximize efficiency in an operation like the federal government.\xc2\xa0 Again, I just know that\'s what interests the President.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t guarantee you at this stage that that\'s what they\'re talking about, but I know that is a subject that interests the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- ideas he advanced during the campaign the President has come around to think maybe that was not such a bad idea after all -- economic idea, social ideas, policy ideas?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, there were certainly things that the two men agreed on.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you watch the debates there were certain like "I agree with the President" on this or "I agree with Governor Romney on this."\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t say it was the majority of things.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t.\xc2\xa0 And they clearly had very starkly different ideas about how to move the economy forward and the like.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard the President reference specific things put forward during the campaign, but I\'m confident that there are ideas that the two men agree on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that he could play a role in solving this fiscal cliff impact --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not going to speculate.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the fiscal cliff is upon us at the moment.\xc2\xa0 We\'re dealing with that with Congress.\xc2\xa0 This is I think an initial conversation in the wake of the election that the President and Governor are having.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a couple of questions to follow up on the Sandy supplemental.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration put that proposal forward before year-end?\xc2\xa0 And does he want it wrapped up as part of whatever needs to be done to avoid the fiscal cliff?\xc2\xa0 And does he believe as a matter of policy it should not be offset with any spending cuts, it should be added to the deficit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Major, I just confess that I haven\'t -- I\'ve been so focused on these other issues, the fiscal cliff and others, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a real discussion with folks here about that.\xc2\xa0 So I just don\'t know the framework within which we want to proceed on that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re definitely looking at the proposals put forward by the states and the requests put forward by the states.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\'t have more detail on it.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t want to guess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How close is the administration --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had it described in my presence as something that would be part of the fiscal cliff deal.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard that discussed.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I just haven\'t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t rule it out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 How close is the administration to recognizing and arming the Syrian opposition?\xc2\xa0 And what has changed to lead those discussions to what appears to be a culmination in the affirmative?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\'ve had discussions in the past. I mean, I\'ve been asked about this in the past when stories have been written that this is an issue.\xc2\xa0 Our position on assistance to the Syrian opposition has not changed.\xc2\xa0 And the United States remains committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and providing non-lethal equipment and training to unarmed, civilian-led opposition groups.\xc2\xa0 We have not provided any support to the armed opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is also the case, as I\'ve said periodically when asked that we\'re always reviewing the kinds of assistance that we\'re providing to the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But we have not changed our position on the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You categorically deny the reports today that suggest the administration is on the cusp of recognizing and beginning to arm the Syrian opposition?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I just said that we\'re always look at and reviewing our assistance programs to the Syrian opposition, the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 I can categorically state that today our position is what it has been, which is we are not providing lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I come back to the budget talks, and specifically the spending side?\xc2\xa0 Because I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what Speaker Boehner\'s main complaint is -- that there are these talks going on, they wanted to be flexible on the revenue side, but they want to see a specific proposal for additional cuts on the spending entitlement side.\xc2\xa0 And you were just holding up the President\'s budget.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that\xe2\x80\x99s it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all you get, what\'s in here is our proposal and nothing more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said, in fact, that the President made clear and continues to make clear that he knows he will not -- he is not wedded to every detail in his proposals, and will not get every detail in his proposals.\xc2\xa0 But we have, in answer to the question of where are your spending cut proposals, it must be a rhetorical question because those who ask it know that we have put forward very specific spending cut proposals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I noted the other day, in this proposal are $340 billion of savings from our health care entitlement programs over 10 years -- $340 billion.\xc2\xa0 That number exceeds what was contained in the Simpson-Bowles proposals -- exceeds -- in the first 10 years. So this is real.\xc2\xa0 The President has always engaged in this with real numbers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen you talk about flexibility on revenue, all we\'ve heard so far -- and it\'s welcome, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong -- but we\'ve heard that, yes, revenue is on the table, but we need more than that.\xc2\xa0 We need concrete proposals and acknowledgement that the only way we can achieve the kind of target that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary for balance in revenues and be realistic about it in terms of what can pass Congress, and hold true to the President\'s absolute insistence that the middle class doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get stuck with the bill, is to have rates go up on top earners.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is not -- remember when the President talked about he\'s familiar with the literature of second-term Presidents who overreach, you know what he\'s talking about?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely what he talked about during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 None of this is news to anybody who has followed this debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 My question, though, was on the spending cut side.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying to them, look, if you guys want more than what was in this budget that the President has been very specific about, you need to ask for it?\xc2\xa0 Is that your position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we want to have a discussion about what the overall compromise would look like.\xc2\xa0 But what is non-negotiable, if you will, is that revenues from the wealthiest Americans have to be a part of this, and the only way to get to that revenue target, as I said, is -- so that has to happen.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But revenue has to come first?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a first -- it all goes together.\xc2\xa0 But the President has already put forward substantial savings in health care entitlements, as well as non-defense discretionary savings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the only thing -- the reason I\'m asking is the political ownership of this.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying, well, you guys want us to take the political heat for cutting granny\'s Medicare, and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- look, as I noted during the last two election cycles, Republicans pummeled Democrats, including my boss, because he had the temerity to include in the Affordable Care Act $716 billion in savings from our health care entitlements.\xc2\xa0 Just pummeled them, right?\xc2\xa0 He did that because it was the right thing to do; it was important to achieve the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 These savings were achievable without harming beneficiaries.\xc2\xa0 And now he has put forward additional savings from those health care entitlement programs -- again, savings that are reasonable and don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, as Republicans did earlier this year with their budget proposals, seniors to accept a plan that ends Medicare as we know it, turns Medicare into a voucher -- all so that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to ask the wealthiest to pay more.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo a lot -- this debate has been engaged.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s seriousness has been demonstrated, and he is going to continue to be very serious about it.\xc2\xa0 And he owns his proposals, and he will -- he looks forward to working on a package proposal that includes the elements that we\'ve talked about and includes tough choices for everyone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril and then Roger and then Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we understand that Governor Romney has left the building.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Like Elvis.\xc2\xa0 Is there any way, any chance that we can get a readout at least, something later on today from you?\xc2\xa0 Could you do that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see -- yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide something.\xc2\xa0 I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President yet about the lunch, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide something on paper for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also speaking about this Romney luncheon and just the phone call with the Speaker, I remember at the onset of this administration about four years ago when they were conversations about transparency.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about transparency today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think transparency is very important.\xc2\xa0 I think that this is the most -- indisputably the most transparent White House that has --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you shut us down all throughout this briefing pretty much?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What are you talking about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What am I talking about?\xc2\xa0 Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to let you in, can\'t talk about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President had a private lunch with his opponent from the campaign, as is entirely appropriate.\xc2\xa0 Nothing is preventing you from speaking with Governor Romney about it --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to get --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\'s obviously up to former Governor Romney to decide whether he wants to have a conversation with you.\xc2\xa0 But the -- and you are welcome when the President next appears before you to ask him about it.\xc2\xa0 We will provide a readout.\xc2\xa0 But we didn\'t -- I think they wanted to have -- each man wanted to have a private conversation.\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t want to turn it into a press event.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re bringing in -- on the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s conversation -- you\'re bringing all these people in, the stakeholders and bringing them into the conversation, but shutting them off and not letting people know exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in conversations or parts of that with the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 I mean transparency is not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think participants in the conversations that have taken place in this building have volubly discussed those conversations with the press, many members right out here at the stakeout and others elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hardly -- I just don\'t agree.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is very interested in having business leaders who have met with him, regular -- ordinary Americans who have met with him, labor leaders and others, civic leaders, talk about what they\'re hearing from the President and his team and what their ideas are about how we move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoger and then Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Okay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 First some old business I had asked yesterday about Mississippi River closing and Senator Harkin -- I understand you might have some --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did look into this a little bit more, and I can tell you that the President remains very concerned about the devastating impact of the drought.\xc2\xa0 He actually raised this with Secretary Vilsack yesterday in the Cabinet meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, who?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President raised it with Secretary Vilsack yesterday in the Cabinet meeting.\xc2\xa0 He asked about the drought and for an update from Secretary Vilsack in this.\xc2\xa0 And going back to the summer, he directed -- he, the President, directed his administration to take every step within our authority to mitigate the damage caused by the drought, and the Army Corps has taken proactive action over the time to ensure navigability of the river system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHowever, we also share the specific concerns from lawmakers and others about the decreasing water level of the Mississippi.\xc2\xa0 And while there is a complex set of legal technical and policy questions around these issues, we are exploring all possible options.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We, meaning the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, fine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the administration writ large.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question, different topic.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Susan Rice and her husband hold stock in TransCanada Corporation valued at between $300,000 and $600,000 -- TransCanada being the outfit that wants to build the pipeline under review at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 If she were nominated as Secretary of State, would that pose any sort of conflict?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give two answers here.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President has not made a decision about that or other personnel moves that he has to make because Secretary Clinton is leaving, Secretary Geithner is leaving.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one point.\xc2\xa0 So I have no -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about a personnel decision the President has not made, a nomination he has not put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecondly, I would commend Republican opposition researchers for the intellectual bandwidth that is required to read a financial disclosure form, because this was all documented in a financial disclosure form, entirely, appropriately, legally and by the books.\xc2\xa0 So what this represents I think in vivid fashion is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about for a while now, which is that none of this has anything to do with the tragedy that occurred in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 This is about politics.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a shame.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I actually, in part of my old-school presentation here that included a hard copy of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, I brought an interesting news article here that begins with the fact that a member of Congress requested those original talking points from the intelligence community that have been so much discussed.\xc2\xa0 And I liked this couple of sentences.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cMore than 10 weeks later, the four pallid sentences that intelligence analysts cautiously delivered are the unlikely center of a quintessential Washington drama in which a genuine tragedy has been fed into the meat grinder of election-year politics.\xc2\xa0 In the process, the most important questions about Benghazi, where Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed\xe2\x80\xa6have largely gotten lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I agree with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the question wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about Benghazi at all.\xc2\xa0 The question is about why the conflict.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a conflict, explain to us why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has that got to do with Benghazi at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because, Major, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not so na\xc3\xafve to believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing these articles because of the continued assault that\xe2\x80\x99s been taking place on Ambassador Rice that has all started with the non-event of her appearances on Sunday shows, one.\xc2\xa0 Two --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to help my colleague.\xc2\xa0 He asked you a specific question --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I answered that question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about a nomination process that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even occurred.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a conflict, and if not, why not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s based on speculation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If somebody were nominated, would there be a conflict?\xc2\xa0 Let\'s address this once we have a nomination.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a disqualifier, in other words?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the President has said and others have said, I have said to the extent that my opinion matters, that Susan Rice is eminently qualified for any number of high-level foreign policy positions, including the one she has where she has performed with great distinction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI owe Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to -- I think what the Republican point would be is that they have come off the position that they had a year and a half ago where you all put that forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you seen a proposal that demonstrates that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen one from you, either.\xc2\xa0 I\'m questioning whether --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s the same proposal from last year.\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying they\'re willing to go beyond --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Peter --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I finish the question?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re saying they\'re willing to come beyond the proposal that they agreed to last year in terms of non-tax revenues.\xc2\xa0 They have not given a specific proposal.\xc2\xa0 You are going to that as a proposal you had last year, which is reasonable.\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to come beyond that proposal of last year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have said, as the -- echoing the President, that he is not wedded to every detail in his plan and he understands that tough choices are required and compromise means moving off of your position.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to get into specifics or numbers about what cuts will look like in this area or that.\xc2\xa0 But he is committed to spending cuts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut to go back to your question here, the issue is "we haven\'t seen any spending cuts from the White House," and that\xe2\x80\x99s just fundamentally not the case.\xc2\xa0 They have not been adopted.\xc2\xa0 They are still serious, substantive, viable proposals that have not been adopted.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we\'ve never seen, going back even to the passing of paper in 2011, are anything like -- when it comes to revenue, anything like the kind of specificity we\'ve provided on cuts from the Republicans on revenue.\xc2\xa0 And to this day we haven\'t seen that.\xc2\xa0 And to this day, I believe on the floor of one of the chambers, one of the Republican leaders said -- as if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have this debate, and as if the American people haven\'t spoken -- that there is no way we\'re going to raise rates on high-income Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, another way to look at that is that they insist on voting for a tax cut, again, for the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get that, you, 98 percent of the American people, get a tax hike.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not a position that plausible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask a question --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, let me give Peter some time.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, you said he is not wedded to the details, but he is saying he is willing to go with spending cuts that are broader, larger, deeper, more in total amount than that would encompass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that, without getting into a negotiating posture here, that when the President says that he is willing to move off of his proposals, acknowledge that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything he wants, that he\'s acknowledging that this is a negotiation and that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get everything you want in a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And clearly, Republicans are interested in spending cuts, and he looks forward to having that discussion.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut a fundamental proposition here, which at least rhetorically has been addressed but not in any substantive way, is that revenues have to be a part of this.\xc2\xa0 And the only way to get to the revenues that are necessary to achieve the balance that the American people want is to not give another tax cut to millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as I talked about before, it\'s sort of a -- it\'s like a two-step hurdle here.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve cleared one hurdle by saying that revenues need to be part of this.\xc2\xa0 Now we get to the next stage, which is what those revenues look like and what they have to look like.\xc2\xa0 Because there has not been any credible proposal that anyone has seen that could pass Congress or makes economic sense that creates the kind of revenue necessary without raising rates.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGood?\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:07 P.M.
