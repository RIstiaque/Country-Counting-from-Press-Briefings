Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t** Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to you questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Great, thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\'re going to kick it off, Josh?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0General Campbell told the Senate this morning that the U.S. military strike mistakenly hit this medical clinic in Kunduz. \xc2\xa0Now that we have that level of specificity about the fact that this was a mistake on behalf of the United States, does the President plan to apologize to Doctors Without Borders or to the families of the victims of that incident?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, you are correct. \xc2\xa0I had an opportunity to be briefed on General Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today, and General Campbell did indicate that the strike in the hospital was a mistake. \xc2\xa0And there still is more that needs to be learned, however, about how exactly this happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has called for the kind of investigations that will yield a full accounting of what transpired. \xc2\xa0There is already underway an investigation that\'s being conducted by the *Justice [Defense] Department. \xc2\xa0There are also investigations that are ongoing that are being led by NATO and a separate third investigation that is a joint investigation that\'s being carried out both by the United States and Afghan officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I acknowledged yesterday, General Campbell has been in touch with President Ghani and offered condolences to the Afghan people, and there have been senior administration officials that have been in touch with officials at Doctors Without Borders.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat occurred in Kunduz over the weekend is a profound tragedy. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned yesterday, volunteers at Doctors Without Borders are physicians who use their training to try to meet the medical needs of people in forgotten parts of the world. And these physicians, at great risk to their own personal security, enter into these situations to try to meet the needs of those who, in many cases, are in a terrible situation. \xc2\xa0And so to learn of the death of these individuals is tragic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I say all of that to make clear to you and to people around the world that this is something that the United States takes quite seriously. \xc2\xa0In fact, the Department of Defense goes to greater lengths than any other military organization in the world to prevent civilian casualties. \xc2\xa0And that is what leads General Campbell to conclude that this was a mistake.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt does warrant mentioning that that stands in pretty stark contrast to the strategy that is implemented by extremists in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Extremists regularly claim credit for operations that target civilian populations. \xc2\xa0That is part and parcel of their strategy inside of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And that stands in pretty stark contrast to the U.S. strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the President also has the expectation that steps will be taken to try to prevent this kind of thing from happening again. \xc2\xa0And I also understand from General Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today that he has already tasked his team to conduct a review and to carry out retraining where necessary to try to prevent these kinds of things from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut before I say a whole lot more about this -- although I will acknowledge I\xe2\x80\x99ve said quite a bit now -- but before I say a whole lot more about this, we would want the investigations to be completed, to have a full accounting of what transpired, and some discussion about what next steps will be necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And General Campbell also said in open session this morning that he thinks the President should revise his plan for troop withdrawal. \xc2\xa0He thinks that leaving just those 1,000 people in the embassy would restrict the ability of the U.S. to train Afghan forces and also carry out counterterror operations. \xc2\xa0I know that you said yesterday that you\'re not going to put a timeline on the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision on this, but with the top commander there saying this pretty publicly, can you give us at least a sense of which way the President would be leaning on this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would resist the urge to speculate on that at this point, Josh. \xc2\xa0The President did announce back in March that the United States would leave about 10,000 troops in Afghanistan through the end of this year, and they\xe2\x80\x99d be engaged in essentially two missions. \xc2\xa0The first is a counterterrorism mission that is explicitly tied to protecting the United States and our interests around the world. \xc2\xa0The second mission is separate but not completely unrelated, which is offering some training, advice, and assistance to Afghan security forces. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what Afghan security forces are trying to do is trying to secure their country so that they can stabilize the government there and provide more opportunity to the Afghan people. \xc2\xa0That\'s in the interest of the United States because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that terrorists have previously tried to capitalize on chaos in that country to organize and plan and even implement terror attacks against the United States. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest to support the Afghan security forces as they are pursuing that mission. \xc2\xa0And that support is in the form of training, advice, and assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the future presence looks like and what our future strategy will be in Afghanistan is something that will be determined by a variety of things. \xc2\xa0The first is conditions on the ground -- what kind of progress has been made toward securing that country, what threats remain, what sort of assistance can the United States provide to the Afghan people, to the Afghan government and to the Afghan security forces as they try to provide for that security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision will be driven by those conditions on the ground and what our longer-term strategy is there. \xc2\xa0The President will certainly take into account the recommendations that are provided by General Campbell. \xc2\xa0General Campbell obviously is seeing firsthand the challenges that are faced there. \xc2\xa0But the President also will take input from his diplomatic team; he\xe2\x80\x99ll take input from the intelligence community; he\xe2\x80\x99ll take input from the civilian leadership at the Pentagon, as they all offer their advice to craft a strategy for moving forward inside of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll also take into account the views and preferences of our NATO allies who have also played an important role in carrying out the missions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described. \xc2\xa0So there a variety of factors to take into account here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is not in any way to diminish the input of General Campbell. \xc2\xa0In fact, his input is quite important. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only input the President will receive as he makes this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President is having lunch today with an old friend of his. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Any sense of what might be on his mind, what might be going on? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just a weekly get-together. \xc2\xa0The President and the Vice President do have the opportunity to have lunch just about every week, depending on the busy schedules of those two men. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a habit of not reading out the details of their conversations. \xc2\xa0Typically they cover more than one topic over the course of their lunch, and I would anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll cover more than one topic in today\xe2\x80\x99s lunch, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the top court in Europe today ruled that data that\'s being held on servers here in the U.S. is essentially unsafe because the NSA is spying on it. \xc2\xa0And I know that -- I know what your views are about NSA programs and also about the person who disclosed them, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not really asking about that. But I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious about if there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern from an economic standpoint that this data pact that U.S. companies have been relying on to do business in Europe has now been invalidated.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is concern about the economic consequences of this particular ruling, Josh. \xc2\xa0We\'re aware of that ruling. \xc2\xa0And while we\'re reviewing that ruling, we\'re disappointed that the court has struck down an agreement that since 2000 has proved to be critical in protecting both privacy and fostering economic growth in the United States and the European Union.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States, principally through the Department of Commerce will work with the European Union to provide certainty to companies both in Europe and the United States to release an updated safe harbor framework. \xc2\xa0There have been discussions ongoing about an updated framework for some time, and we\'re ready -- even as we review the decision, we\'re going to work with the European Commission to release that updated framework.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0What is the White House assessment of the Russian argument that its incursion into NATO member Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s airspace was an accident?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that NATO has indicated that there was more than one incursion, and I know the Secretary General of NATO expressed some concerns about that activity. \xc2\xa0We share those significant concerns. \xc2\xa0And the United States has been consulting with our NATO allies about them. \xc2\xa0But Turkey is not just a NATO ally of the United States. \xc2\xa0Turkey is also a member of the anti-ISIL coalition that has been working closely with the United States and 63 or 64 other countries to implement our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And it took a number of months of diplomacy to get Turkey fully engaged in this effort, and the length of those negotiations I think is an indication to you, Jeff, and to the world of how important Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s role is in this matter. \xc2\xa0And it is -- we certainly appreciate the important role that Turkey has stepped up to play in terms of making a military contribution to this effort, but also to provide for the security of their own country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTurkey, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out on a number of occasions, has a border with Syria that stretches that some 500 miles. \xc2\xa0So they are justifiably concerned about the security situation inside of Syria and the threat that ISIL and other extremists inside of Syria could pose to Turkey.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all that is to say that we have expressed our concerns in the past with Russian activity that runs contrary to this international counter-ISIL effort that the United States is leading. \xc2\xa0And certainly the kind of activity that was described by the NATO Secretary General is not consistent with the kind of constructive contribution that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to Russia make to the broader international counter-ISIL effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President said last week he was directing his staff to scrub existing authorities on gun control to see if there are further executive actions that can get done. \xc2\xa0Who is leading that process? \xc2\xa0And did you take Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comments about her desire to implement more executive action if she becomes President as a hit for not having done more?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Domestic Policy Council obviously plays an important role in examining policy considerations like this. \xc2\xa0The Vice President, given his expertise on these matters, also has played an important role. \xc2\xa0And members of his staff have played an important role in designing some of the gun safety rules that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward, these executive actions that were an effort to reduce gun violence in this country. \xc2\xa0So there are a variety of figures here at the White House that are involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President made a reference to scrutinizing the laws, and I think that would be an indication to you that there are lawyers involved here at the White House in this matter, as well. \xc2\xa0So there are a variety of people who are leading this effort. \xc2\xa0But it is an effort that in the past has yielded some important progress. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quiet forthright in acknowledging that the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in terms of implementing executive actions is not as important as the progress that could be made if Congress were to take some of the common-sense steps that they could take.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the announcements from Secretary Clinton in the context of her presidential campaign, those kinds of policy proposals are the kinds of ideas that we welcome in the context of this debate. \xc2\xa0The President made clear that progress in this regard will require a robust political debate in this country. \xc2\xa0And we certainly welcome the contributions of who, according to just about every poll, is the leading Democratic candidate for President. \xc2\xa0We would welcome the contribution of somebody with a voice that prominent in the debate trying to advance this effort.<br/>\n\tSo that is the -- we welcome that kind of contribution to the debate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, Josh, the Volkswagen chief executive told workers today that they should prepare for job cuts. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned -- because of the emissions scandal. \xc2\xa0Are you concerned that that will hurt the German economy, which is pretty important for the world economy, and/or the United States economy, given the plants from VW that are here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any broader analysis of the economic impact of this scandal. \xc2\xa0There are obviously significant concerns that have been raised by the conduct of the leadership at Volkswagen, particularly when it comes to complying with important regulations here in the United States. \xc2\xa0And I understand that there have been questions that have been raised now in other countries about this matter. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our principal concern here is making sure that countries -- or companies that are interacting with the EPA as they try to implement the Clean Air Act are doing so honestly, and that they\'re doing so in full compliance with regulations and expectations of honesty and forthrightness. \xc2\xa0And questions have been raised about that. \xc2\xa0But I have not seen any broader analysis done about the possible economic impact of Volkswagen\xe2\x80\x99s malfeasance.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back to your answer to Josh on the safe harbor agreement. \xc2\xa0The sticking point in those negotiations seems to be access by American intelligence to European data. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this ruling puts any greater pressure, gives Europe any greater leverage to limit U.S. access to that data, and what impact it\xe2\x80\x99s really been having on U.S. intelligence capabilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, I\xe2\x80\x99m routinely reluctant to discuss in much detail U.S. intelligence matters from here. \xc2\xa0But there is a legal matter that I would direct you to, which is that the U.S. legal framework for intelligence collection includes robust protection for privacy under multiple layers of oversight and a remarkable degree of transparency.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of those are reforms that have been put in place in just the last few years, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated commitment to greater transparency. \xc2\xa0And the concern that we have about this ruling is -- we have a variety of concerns about this specific ruling. \xc2\xa0One of them is that we believe that this decision was based on incorrect assumptions about data privacy protections in the United States. \xc2\xa0And the ruling fails to properly credit the benefits to privacy and growth that have been afforded by this framework over the last 15 years. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our concerns -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a variety of concerns with the ruling, but we certainly have been working with our European counterparts in recent months to release an updated safe harbor framework. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue working on that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Looking back on one of Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s questions. \xc2\xa0One of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s sort of gun control proposals was revoking a law that gives protection to both gun manufacturers and dealers if their guns are used in a crime. \xc2\xa0This is kind of special exemption in the past, I think a couple decades ago and maybe 10 years ago. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President also supports that as a sort of legislative proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not looked in detail at the proposal that she has put forward so let me reserve judgment on that. \xc2\xa0But we can have somebody follow up with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And my last one is on TPP. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching your guys sort of campaign online for TPP.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thanks for watching. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Well, I noticed yesterday that a number of White House officials retweeted Kevin Johnson, the Mayor of Sacramento, who, just a couple of weeks ago Deadspin reported a woman who received a six-figure settlement from Johnson reportedly because -- allegedly because she was abused by him when she was 15 years old. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s also been accused of sexual assault by a number of students at the school that he used to be a principal at. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is really the type of figurehead that you guys want to put in front of your TPP campaign. \xc2\xa0And if he\xe2\x80\x99s been somebody that the President has kind of worked with a lot on a local level, if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be part of your guys\xe2\x80\x99 efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports related to the matters that you cited. \xc2\xa0And I think there are a variety of investigations that are underway there. \xc2\xa0So I at this point wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on those specific matters. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President -- knowing that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on the specific matters related to the Mayor, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on sexual assault and his commitment to stopping sexual assault, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on campus or in the military or anywhere else, I think is quite well known. \xc2\xa0Since he\xe2\x80\x99s had the opportunity to speak out on this issue on a number of occasions. So I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubting his commitment to fighting sexual assault.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the argument that we want to make about TPP and the economic benefits associated with opening up overseas markets for American goods is an argument that many people are making. \xc2\xa0There are a wide variety of Democrats and Republicans in a variety of positions across the country, including a number of mayors who are making this argument. \xc2\xa0And we have been engaged in an effort to lift up those arguments because we believe that -- obviously the President believes with a lot of conviction that reaching an agreement like this to open up access to overseas markets for American goods, cutting 18,000 import taxes in 11 of the most economically dynamic countries in the world is a clear benefit to the United States and our economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to drive that message quite aggressively and use it as we try to persuade Democrats and Republicans to take the important but necessary step of ratifying this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give us an indication of what we can expect from the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Oregon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is planning to travel to Oregon on Friday morning. \xc2\xa0As you know, Ron, the President had a previously scheduled trip to the West Coast, so it does not require a significant change in his travel plans for him to travel to Oregon and spend some time with the families of those who were either injured or killed in the tragic shooting that occurred there last week. \xc2\xa0I would not anticipate much of a public appearance from the President. \xc2\xa0The stated purpose of his trip is to spend some time with the families that have been affected by this outrageous act of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any question whether there would be a public event of some sort?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I do not anticipate that there will be a public event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And whether -- given the work of the Domestic Policy Council and others on trying to come up with other executive actions, when do you think we might anticipate something new -- some new proposal on that front, given I would think that the President wants to keep the momentum going on this issue now given what\xe2\x80\x99s happened out there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a timeframe for if or when any additional executive actions might be taken. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President\xe2\x80\x99s team is hard at work on them and has been for some time considering what other options may be available to the President to try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. \xc2\xa0There are some common-sense things that Congress could do to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and others who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them in a way that doesn\'t undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything imminently?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I just don\'t have any guidance for you on the timing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, on the MSF incident in Afghanistan, you said that there\xe2\x80\x99s still -- still more needs to be learned before an apology. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to apologize or not accept responsibility, but MSF is a very -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of a more credible organization, given the kind of work that they do. \xc2\xa0This was an established facility. \xc2\xa0The coordinates for it were exchanged with coalition forces. \xc2\xa0They say that the planes were circling for a half hour or so. \xc2\xa0There was one specific building out of several that was targeted, an intensive care center, an emergency room. \xc2\xa0The point is there seems to be a lot of detail that\'s already available to the administration. \xc2\xa0And, yes, I understand the need for investigations, but does the United States accept responsibility for this, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t apologize for this at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d do is I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to what General Campbell has said. \xc2\xa0And he said very clearly that the strike on the hospital was a mistake. \xc2\xa0He noted, as I have in the past, that the Department of Defense goes to greater lengths than any other military organization in the world to prevent civilian casualties.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that what has transpired here is a profound tragedy for many of the reasons that you have cited. \xc2\xa0But before I go further than that, I do want these investigators to collect all the available information to try to learn exactly what happened and provide the full accounting that the President has asked for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said that there were some administration contact with MSF --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct -- that there have been senior administration officials who have been in touch with leaders at Doctors Without Borders, MSF. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As part of the investigation or to express -- can you describe or characterize those -- that? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have details of those conversations to share at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Again, I asked because it just -- based on what they are saying and the credibility of this organization, this is a -- in many ways, just a very profound event.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I think the criticism or the concern is that the administration is not responding in a way that they would like.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly understand the sense that a lot of people have to understand exactly what happened and for there to be reforms or changes in the rules of engagement, or other procedures that are in place in the military to make it less likely that events like this happen again.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere certainly is a desire on the part of the President to have a clear understanding of what exactly transpired. \xc2\xa0But we also run the risk of not getting the kind of full accounting that the President would like if we rush the investigation. \xc2\xa0And this is an investigation that\'s only been underway here for three days or so now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is a sense of urgency about this. \xc2\xa0And there is no denying the significance and scale of the tragedy that transpired at the MSF hospital in Kunduz. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned yesterday, these are physicians who are not collecting a large salary. \xc2\xa0In most cases -- I think maybe even all cases -- these are individuals who are volunteering their time who have left the safety and security of their homes to go and try to provide for the medical needs of people that they would otherwise never meet. \xc2\xa0In fact, they\'re going to a place like Kunduz because this is a part of the world that people have either forgotten or they\'re, understandably, scared to travel to. \xc2\xa0But these doctors use the training that they have. \xc2\xa0They display tremendous courage to go there in the first place. \xc2\xa0And the fact that they were killed even as they were providing that medical treatment is a terrible tragedy. \xc2\xa0And there is no diminishing the sense of loss that is being felt by that organization and by the families of those who were lost.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is necessary is a full accounting of what exactly transpired. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what the Department of Defense is working on. \xc2\xa0I would -- I think I would reiterate that the expectation is that this is the kind of investigation that would move quickly, but at the same time, an accurate accounting of what transpired so that accountability can be enforced if necessary. \xc2\xa0And certainly changes to the rules of engagement or other standard operating procedures can be implemented to make it less likely that something like this would ever happen again.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Coming back to the trip to Oregon. \xc2\xa0The President at least twice explicitly said that it was his intent to politicize what happened out there. \xc2\xa0So in what ways does he intend to politicize this trip if he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do a public appearance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think in this instance, Jon, on Friday morning the trip would not be about politics, but that trip would be about merely consoling the families of those who were so profoundly affected by that tragedy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the President, in his public statements both on Thursday in the immediate aftermath of the event, and on Friday, made quite clear that what essentially the NRA and other advocates for gun manufacturers have done is effectively politicized this issue to prevent congressional action. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that if we\'re going to win a -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important for the American people who share his view that there are some common-sense things we can do to reduce gun violence -- that they\'re going to have to mobilize politically to counter that political effort on the part of the NRA and other organizations like them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you said just a few minutes ago that it would be helpful on the gun issue to have Hillary Clinton out there making the case for measures to combat gun violence. \xc2\xa0I assume it would also be helpful to have Hillary Clinton out there making the case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0Given her work as Secretary of State in the development of that agreement, and her strong support for the development of that agreement as Secretary of State, would you expect that she would be out there supportive of this agreement? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would expect that she would make up her own mind about whether or not --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0She would? \xc2\xa0Because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from her yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, she\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample time to make a decision about whether or not she supports the agreement. \xc2\xa0The full text of the agreement has not been released yet, so I certainly would be sympathetic to her desire to want to review the agreement in detail before offering up a position on it. \xc2\xa0That\'s the expectation I would have for every member of Congress. And given the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency, that\'s something that we are hoping we can do relatively soon. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s a long document, and there are a variety of issues to finalize before that text is made public. \xc2\xa0But the President has committed to making that text public prior to his signature and prior, of course, of Congress having to take it up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But would you expect that she would support this agreement given her past support for the development of this agreement? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would expect that she will take a look at the details of the agreement and arrive at her own conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would the President be disappointed if she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in support of this agreement?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Certainly the administration would welcome her support, as well as the support of any other presidential candidates that wanted to come out in favor of the deal and urge Congress to support it. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, this will be a decision for her to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess the one other thing that I do want to mention is that we have heard other presidential candidates sort of indicate what they claim to be is an openness to working with the administration to try to prevent other acts of gun violence. \xc2\xa0Many of them talk about the need for better mental health treatment and better mental health care for those individuals who need it. \xc2\xa0One way that -- one particular program that has been particularly effective in expanding access to mental health care across the country is the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0So voting more than 50 times to repeal a piece of legislation that has done more to expand mental health care across the country is certainly not in keeping with their commitment to want to actually address this significant problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the biggest providers of mental health care, particularly in disadvantaged communities, is Medicaid. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of Republicans, including Republican governors and Republican state legislators, resist the effort to expand Medicaid, which would actually expand substantially mental health care coverage to millions of Americans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for those who say that they want to work with the administration, at least one area when it comes to limiting acts of gun violence, we would welcome their contribution and their support for implementing the Affordable Care Act and expanding Medicaid.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you would welcome the support of Republican presidential candidates -- you would welcome their support of Obamacare?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But if they say that they want to work with the administration on mental health care, and if that\'s the real way that we\'re going to stop these acts of -- these heinous acts of gun violence, then I\'ve got some good ideas about how they can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t hold your breath.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I won\'t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last quick one. \xc2\xa0Edward Snowden, in an interview with BBC, said he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to come back to the United States to serve jail time. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering, where are we on that? \xc2\xa0Do you take that offer seriously? \xc2\xa0Are there ongoing efforts to bring him back still?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have made clear what our position is, which is that he is an American citizen who has been charged with serious crimes and we believe that he should be returned to the United States so that he can be afforded all the due process rights that are afforded to every other citizen, but at the same time, he should face those charges. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have an update in terms of our efforts to try to bring about his return to the United States. \xc2\xa0But for any possible discussions or even negotiations between the U.S. government and Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers, I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I\'m going to ask you about a report in the Journal that is suggesting that the Russians are actually targeting U.S.-backed rebels in Syria. \xc2\xa0Does the administration believe that is the case? \xc2\xa0And if so, how does this country avoid getting roped into sort of a proxy war with Russia, if that\'s the case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, the President made a firm commitment in his news conference on Friday that the situation in Syria is not going to turn into a proxy war between the United States and Russia. \xc2\xa0The fact is we see Russia doubling down on their support for Bashar al-Assad that only draws them further and further into a civil war inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And it risks a variety of things. \xc2\xa0It risks Russia\xe2\x80\x99s further isolation from the international community. \xc2\xa0It certainly risks the successful completion of a political transition. \xc2\xa0In fact, we believe it would delay the successful completion of a political transition. And that\'s significant because the Russians themselves acknowledge that a politics transition is what\xe2\x80\x99s required inside of Syria to address many of the concerns that they\xe2\x80\x99ve raised.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other concern for the Russians is obviously involving themselves even more deeply in a sectarian conflict inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports that the Iranians are prepared to get more involved in support of the Russian efforts. \xc2\xa0And that is a dangerous proposition for the Russians, both as they consider the possible reaction of the millions of Sunni Muslims who live inside of Syria and will be alienated by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s support for a regime that has carried out wanton acts of violence against the population, but it also poses some risk to Russia given the substantial Muslim population within Russian borders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the first part of the question -- does the White House believe that the Russians are intentionally targeting U.S.-backed rebels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, what we see is the Russians fail to distinguish between the variety of opposition groups inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And while they claim to be carrying out a military campaign against ISIL, we see that they are most frequently carrying out military operations in areas where there are few, if any, ISIL forces. \xc2\xa0And it certainly calls into question both the wisdom and likelihood of success of their strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also raises legitimate questions about whether Russia is carrying out military actions that are contrary to the goals of our broader international campaign -- coalition campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0One element of that strategy is offering some support to moderate opposition groups inside of Syria, and we have raised concerns in the past and continue to have them today that Russia is failing to distinguish between moderate Syrian opposition groups inside of Syria and extremist groups operating inside of Syria, including ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two parts of one question about TPP. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that this administration believes that this is a way to sort of keep China in check, at least strategically, economically speaking? \xc2\xa0And what do you say to tobacco growers who have expressed a great deal of concern about TPP?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me take your first question first. \xc2\xa0The President has made a quite overt case that if the United States were to scale back our engagement in the Asia Pacific, we risk a scenario where China comes in, lowers standards and writes the rules of the road economically inside of Southeast Asia to put the United States, U.S. businesses and U.S. workers, principally, at a significant disadvantage. \xc2\xa0And the President has chosen the opposite tack, which is to go and engage throughout the Asia Pacific and to raise standards and write the rules of the road of the economy that levels the playing field for American businesses and American workers. \xc2\xa0That will have a positive impact on our economy. \xc2\xa0It will create jobs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is at the Department of Agriculture today -- I believe he just returned -- and he spent some time talking there about how important an agreement like this is for American farmers and ranchers that it opens up a variety of overseas markets for American agricultural products. \xc2\xa0That certainly is a boon to our economy, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that this does put pressure on China to raise environmental standards, to raise labor standards, and to incorporate the kind of intellectual property protections that are included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \xc2\xa0And this does put a lot of pressure on China that typically likes to see their own influence inside of Asia, and by raising economic standards in the Asia Pacific, the economic interests of the United States are well represented. \xc2\xa0But it certainly is a way for the United States to make clear to China that we welcome a rising and growing China, but that there are some expectations that the international community places on countries like China that are seeking to be a genuine international presence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And tobacco growers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And on tobacco growers, the agreement that is included in the TPP gives the health authorities in individual countries the rights and responsibilities to essentially establish their own public health policies. \xc2\xa0And when you\'re entering into trade agreements like this, you\'re always thinking about how these policies will be applied in your own country. \xc2\xa0And certainly the President would be an aggressive advocate of making sure that public health authorities inside the United States have all the authority that they need to protect the health and well-being of the American people. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why those rules are written the way they are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0I just want to follow up very quickly on the question about Snowden. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to ask you while I was up in New York -- did Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s name come up during the protracted meeting between the Presidents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It did not.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of China, Josh, now that the visit of the Chinese President has come and gone, are you any closer to announcing who\xe2\x80\x99s behind the OPM hack? \xc2\xa0And if not, why not? \xc2\xa0Because it seemed like you tied the Sony hack to North Korea pretty quickly. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And that decision to publicly name North Korea as the actor behind the Sony attack was a decision that was made by investigators. \xc2\xa0And the calculation that they made is that by naming the North Koreans it would not inhibit their ability to carry out that full investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe investigators who are looking into the significant breach at the Office of Personnel Management have not arrived at the same conclusion that naming the actor, or at least revealing more information about what we know about the possible actor, would benefit the ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we have said as we\'ve acknowledged the severity of the breach, we have continued to carry out the kind of investigation that will help us learn exactly what transpired and try to gather some more information about what we can do to prevent those kinds of breaches from occurring in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Anything more on the fallout in terms of the information that got out and how it might affect employees --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\'t have additional information to share in terms of what we know about how or even whether that information that was exfiltrated has been used. \xc2\xa0But the Office of Personnel Management has made a commitment to all those individuals who were affected by the breach to try to offer them some protection. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of contacting those individuals and letting them know what sort of tools they can use to protect themselves in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry, I\'m just looking at the pool report, but I\'m wondering if you have -- if you can tell us what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to business leaders and agriculture was, whether there\xe2\x80\x99s -- on agriculture, to go to first -- whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a particular concern, like dairy or something, that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to address. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Cheryl, the reason the President went to the Department of Agriculture is that the U.S. agriculture industry is one of the big winners in this agreement. \xc2\xa0The fact is this will open up a variety of overseas markets for American agricultural products that will create jobs and expand economic growth right here in the United States. \xc2\xa0And that is only one area that we\'ve chosen to highlight of the benefits to the U.S. economy from this agreement going into force. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would just point out that there are a variety of corporate interests who were represented at the meeting, including a senior official at the United States Chamber of Commerce. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that\'s an organization that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often agree with the President and his policy priorities. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to the TPP agreement that\'s been reached, even an organization like the Chamber of Commerce, with whom the President has significant political disagreements, even they agree that this kind of agreement would be in the best interests of American businesses, American workers, and the broader American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this was an opportunity for the President to sit down with business leaders to talk about the benefits of the proposal, to make clear what some of the details are when it comes to expanding access for American goods in overseas markets and how this agreement would cut import taxes -- about 18,000 different import taxes all around the world, including in some of the most economically dynamic countries in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of benefits to discuss and that was part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there one particular or a couple particular concerns that have come about since yesterday that are emerging as sort of top concerns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no. \xc2\xa0I mean, I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a pretty -- I know there has been some frustration expressed by some about the tobacco rules that are written into this thing, or at least the rules that could have an impact on tobacco. \xc2\xa0But as I mentioned yesterday, I believe, the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to go into negotiations with 11 other countries with a goal of just seeking an agreement that would pass Congress. \xc2\xa0The President went in with the goal of actually trying to do the right thing for the country and for our economy. \xc2\xa0And that meant cutting these taxes and opening up access to these markets, reducing non-tariff barriers to U.S. services, and making sure that goods that are stamped \xe2\x80\x9cMade in America\xe2\x80\x9d have the opportunity to compete in economies around the world. \xc2\xa0And that was the goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to put forward a bad agreement just because he thought it was more likely to get passed. \xc2\xa0The President was going to go and negotiate the best possible agreement and then make the case to Congress that this is exactly the right thing for the country. \xc2\xa0That\'s how we\'re moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, three subjects. \xc2\xa0Starting off with Afghanistan, could you give us the initial conversation that DOD gave the White House as to the mistake in Afghanistan, especially as it said that the AC-130s fly very low and can literally fly so low that they can see what they\xe2\x80\x99re flying over and see into what they\xe2\x80\x99re flying over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, April, at this point, I don\'t have the kinds of details that you\'re asking for in terms of where that particular aircraft may have been flying or at what altitude it may have been flying. \xc2\xa0Presumably this will be part of the ongoing investigations into this matter. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you would expect, has received a briefing from the Department of Defense on this, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that still can be learned about what transpired and how it transpired. And that\'s important because the President is very interested in putting in whatever changes are necessary to make it less likely that something like this would happen again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when you were -- when this White House was advised what happened, the White House was apprised of the fact that it is a low-flying plane, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not able to give you much detail about the contents of the briefing that the President received.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0On the next subject, what are the lessons learned a year after Ebola hit the western African countries and the United States? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the lessons learned? \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there were a lot of lessons that were learned from that matter. \xc2\xa0I think the first is that -- the President has had the opportunity to talk about this a little bit -- that the remarkable capacity of the United States armed forces is something that regularly impresses given the way that their involvement in this response galvanized the international community and made a material difference in choking off this outbreak in West Africa. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing that we learned is that investments in medical infrastructure are critically important and that the kinds of investments that we\'ve seen in other countries in Africa that were initially put in place to fight other diseases actually did make a material difference in preventing the spread of this disease across the continent, and it highlights how other countries in Africa could benefit from a similar investment in their health care infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President and his team are serious about following through on some of the work that\'s already been done to build up that infrastructure. \xc2\xa0And I think it was a real tangible example for the American people to understand how the interests of the United States are advanced when we make investments in the health care infrastructure of countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'m sure there are more lessons to be learned than that, but that\'s just two.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One lesson I want to ask if you learned is or that you felt that you did the right thing on not shutting down some of the borders in other countries that could have really defaulted economically if you shut down the borders a year ago to those coming from that country to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that was one controversial decision, or at least a decision that was questioned publicly. \xc2\xa0And the reason for not shutting down transportation, for example, between the United States and the outer world and those countries where the outbreak occurred was the concern that those individuals seeking to leave those countries would find a way to get out of them, and if there was a clear incentive for them to not be truthful about their travel history or to seek ways to evade the detection systems that had been put up by the international community, that that would have been a bad policy decision. \xc2\xa0And I think the wisdom of that decision, while controversial at the time, I think has been borne out by the results.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, since you won\'t give us too much about this friendship meeting today that happens weekly when they can, can you give us just a little bit of color that we don\'t normally know about that meeting, when they meet and some of the things that -- how it\'s done, does the Vice President walk in, shake hands -- (laughter.) \xc2\xa0Can you give us more of the color? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Cloth napkins, candlelight, maybe. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Champagne. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, exactly. \xc2\xa0Maybe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it more formal? \xc2\xa0Is it more casual? \xc2\xa0Are the sleeves rolled up? \xc2\xa0What? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what -- I\'ll try. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Okay? What I would say is that the -- I think it\'s typically pretty casual. \xc2\xa0Obviously the two of them have been having lunch about once a week for almost seven years now, so they can dispense with the formalities. \xc2\xa0It typically will take place in the President\xe2\x80\x99s private dining room, right off the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0I believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s one occasion where you all have been given the opportunity to photograph that lunch. \xc2\xa0But the lunch does not always take place there. \xc2\xa0I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve, on occasion, even had lunch outside on nicer days. \xc2\xa0Today seems like it might fit that description, but I don\'t know whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll eat outside today. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know whether they\xe2\x80\x99ll dine al fresco. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But we\'ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing, as I alluded to answering Josh\xe2\x80\x99s question, is that they obviously have a personal friendship and they know one another quite well and quite personally, and so there is an opportunity for them to talk about their families and some of the other personal aspects of their lives. \xc2\xa0But they also do some important business there, too, and there are -- whether it\'s discussing politics, or upcoming policy decisions that the President has, the President has long relied on the wisdom and insight that the Vice President has to share. \xc2\xa0And that does not just take the form of the Vice President sending memos or attending meetings, but it also includes private and, in some cases, even rather informal consultation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a time limit on it, like 45 minutes, an hour, or what?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it\'s typically scheduled for about 45 minutes, but I think sometimes it runs longer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you so much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I tried. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess on that subject, I have a follow-up. \xc2\xa0Does the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I fired all my ammo now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, exactly. \xc2\xa0I won\'t get into who breaks the bread. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You should. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President have an opinion on how long this decision-making process should take the Vice President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0His opinion is that the Vice President should take all the time that he feels is necessary to make what the President firsthand knows is an intensely personal decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And getting back to a more serious subject, in Oregon, the mother of the Oregon college shooter apparently posted some comments online about her own private weapon collection, and in addition to that, it was well known that she had made comments about her son having issues, having perhaps some mental deficiencies. \xc2\xa0And I\'m just curious, does the White House, does the administration, does the President have an opinion about the wisdom -- and I think this was also the case with Adam Lanza -- there was what was described as an arsenal in the home -- about the idea of people who have children who may have special needs and, at the same time, a gun collection in the house?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that there are some common-sense things that can be done to keep guns away from those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them. \xc2\xa0And there are obviously responsible things that millions -- there are obviously things that millions of responsible gun owners across the country do to keep their homes and their families safe. \xc2\xa0And there are basic responsibilities that relate to locking up your guns when you\'re not using them, and making sure that they are safely stored. \xc2\xa0And I know there are a bunch of proposals that have been put forward in the form of legislation related to trigger locks and other technological improvements that could be made that could contribute to gun safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know there are a variety of views on this, and this is obviously something that the President believes is worthy of additional study. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to this particular family, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the individual positing so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on it other than to say that there is an expectation that gun owners do have a responsibility to store their firearms safely. \xc2\xa0But it\'s hard for me to relate those kinds of policies and those kinds of recommendations to this particular case because I\'m just not aware of all the details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And getting back to the hospital in Afghanistan, I\'m just curious why you\'re stopping short of issuing an official apology in that circumstance. \xc2\xa0A hospital was bombed. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no disputing that. \xc2\xa0The general today said it was a mistake. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no disputing that. \xc2\xa0So why is there not an apology?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, the fact of the matter is there is an ongoing investigation and there is more that must be learned about this particular incident so that the President can get the full accounting that he would like to see. \xc2\xa0If there are individuals that need to be held accountable, the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that they will be. \xc2\xa0And if there are things that the Department of Defense can do to change their procedures, change the rules of engagement to make these kinds of incidents less likely to happen, then the President expects that those will be implemented and implemented promptly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut those are all legitimate questions. \xc2\xa0And the President is at least as eager as everyone else to get answers to those questions. \xc2\xa0As the Commander-in-Chief, he certainly feels a responsibility to get the facts, to get this full accounting, and to make sure that whatever changes are necessary are properly implemented. \xc2\xa0But at this point I would defer additional comment until we see more results of that investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Russia and Syria, you have -- the U.S. believes that the Russians are bombing U.S.-backed Syrian rebels. \xc2\xa0The folks at NATO believe that Russia has now crossed into Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s airspace twice. \xc2\xa0At what point does the President say to Vladimir Putin, cut it out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President has made quite clear that Russia should not be interfering with the 65-member international coalition that is seeking to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve made that quite clear. \xc2\xa0And there has been at least one preliminary conversation between the United States and Russian military officials to try to de-conflict those military activities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It doesn\'t seem like they\'re getting the message, though. \xc2\xa0Just about anybody -- if you give a fair reading and just determine that Russia just is going and doing willy-nilly whatever they feel like doing in Syria. \xc2\xa0And at what point does the President have a problem with that, I guess is my question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised significant concerns about the likelihood of Russia achieving their stated goals. \xc2\xa0For example, many of their military airstrikes have been carried out in areas where there are fewer or any -- if any ISIL forces, and they\'re carrying out those military activities despite the fact that they say that they\'re focused on ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey say that they would like to -- or the Russians acknowledge that the situation will only be resolved when there\xe2\x80\x99s a political transition inside of Syria, and yet, their actions are geared specifically at propping up a leader that has lost legitimacy to lead that country for a variety of reasons. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s lost both the moral authority to lead that country, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also lost the practical support of 80 percent of the population because he\xe2\x80\x99s targeted many of their communities with indiscriminate violence. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a number of reasons to call into question both Russia\xe2\x80\x99s tactics and their strategy. \xc2\xa0And I do think that those actions --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- you can do it about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think those actions are likely to result in Russia becoming more isolated and Russia not accomplishing their stated goals, and antagonizing if not outright angering a significant Muslim population inside of Syria and a significant Muslim population inside of Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as I mentioned in a previous exchange on this, the significant negative consequences that Russia is facing right now as a result of their actions far outweighs any sort of diplomatic demarche that Russia could receive from the rest of the international community.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it seems that\'s as far as you can go, is pointing out the negative consequences. \xc2\xa0That\'s as much as the U.S. can do at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what the U.S. can do is we can continue to stay focused on our strategy, which is to lead a 65-member coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0We are implementing that strategy. \xc2\xa0And in recent weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress in terms of taking some ISIL leaders off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue to implement that strategy in a way that we think serves our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that what Russia is doing is further immersing themselves in a sectarian conflict that could, as the President described on Friday, ultimately lead to them being sucked into a quagmire in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0New topic, Josh. \xc2\xa0The Washington Post today took note of the imminent release of about 6,000 federal prisoners that comes as a result of sentencing guideline changes over the past year. \xc2\xa0I assume given the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest in criminal justice reform that he\xe2\x80\x99s heartened by -- that this process is about to begin I guess at the end of the month. \xc2\xa0But is there any concern inside the White House by the President and others to try to make sure that the release of these prisoners as it begins doesn\'t get sort of caught up in the sort of election year politics that\'s about to come next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mike, I didn\'t have an opportunity to read the story that you\'re referring to. \xc2\xa0But I can say that when it comes to criminal justice reform more broadly, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified this area as one of the very few areas inside of Washington, D.C. where there seems to be some genuine bipartisan agreement. \xc2\xa0That\'s one of the reasons that the administration has been so committed to working to try to advance this particular initiative.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President does believe there is a lot more that we could do to make our criminal justice system more fair and essentially more effective at keeping our communities safe. \xc2\xa0We know that our law enforcement officials do heroic work in so many places to keep our communities safe. \xc2\xa0But there is more that can be done from a policy perspective to make them more effective and to make the results more consistent with our stated goals, which is trying to protect communities across the country, but also making sure that justice is admitted fairly -- administered fairly. \xc2\xa0That\'s a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are some economic reasons for us to consider those kinds of reforms. \xc2\xa0And so certainly the President considers this a priority, and we\'re pleased to see that many Republicans consider this to be a priority too. \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant level of concern that any rhetoric on the campaign trail could sabotage the important bipartisan work that\'s currently ongoing on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m right about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two questions on TPP. \xc2\xa0You said to Justin the President would campaign aggressively for it. \xc2\xa0Can you elaborate on some of the ways he\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing that? \xc2\xa0And secondly, does he feel an obligation to deliver a significant number of Democrats so the entire burden isn\xe2\x80\x99t on the Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple things about that, George.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is that obviously the President went and did a public event at the Department of Agriculture, at least an event where the press corps was allowed to see the President conduct the meeting and to deliver some remarks to the press pool there to advocate for the agreement. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to see the President making public appearances advocating for this agreement. \xc2\xa0There obviously are a lot of reasons for Democrats and Republicans to support it, and the President will take advantage of many opportunities to make that argument.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to our efforts to build support for this in Congress, I think we saw in the protracted fight over the summer about -- over trade promotion authority that this is an agreement that is likely to be ratified only if enough Democrats and Republicans support it. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to need members from both parties. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be possible to ratify this trade agreement strictly along party lines. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s why the arguments that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see from the administration will be arguments that appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what that argument -- or that debate over the summer also revealed is that more Republicans in Congress are receptive to the arguments about the benefits of a trade agreement like this than Democrats. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of reasons for that. \xc2\xa0But the President took a rather practical approach to building bipartisan support for trade promotion authority, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take a similarly practical approach in building bipartisan support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Mara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\'re not -- you don\'t have any goal in mind for the numbers of Democrats?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that our legislative team --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not that you\'re going to share with us.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s correct. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thanks for letting me off the hook that easily. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one quick thing. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no DOJ investigation, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a DOD investigation, is that correct? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said DOJ earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Of the hospital.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I apologize. \xc2\xa0I misspoke. \xc2\xa0So there are three investigations. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s DOD, NATO, and then a joint U.S.-Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0I apologize for misspeaking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Afghanistan, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can characterize for us if these tragic events, this mistake in Afghanistan at a Doctors Without Borders facility, if that is affecting the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking at all -- factoring the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking at all about a U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and the long-term risks associated with being there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision about our forward-looking presence in Afghanistan is one that will be influenced by factors on the ground. \xc2\xa0And so that certainly would include the relative strength or weakness of the Afghan security forces and the risks that U.S. military personnel are facing in Afghanistan now while they carry out both their train-advise-and-assist mission and their counterterrorism mission inside of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0So the President will certainly factor all of those things into the equation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President has urged his team regularly to resist the temptation to make snap decisions based on one or two incidents; that what the President wants is a much more strategic look. \xc2\xa0And what the President ultimately is making is a more strategic decision about the long-term trajectory of our interests in Afghanistan and in the region. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what will drive the decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess to try to answer your question as directly as possible, of course incidents on the ground -- including high-profile incidents -- and what they say about the relative strength or weakness of the Afghan security forces will have an impact on the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision. \xc2\xa0But it is not the only thing that is driving the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision. \xc2\xa0In fact, the most important calculation in the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision is determining what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best long-term interest of the United States in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President had a chance to review what General Campbell put forward, what he referenced today in terms of changing needs on ground and changing U.S. military presence to match that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I acknowledge that General Campbell did discuss at some length the recommendations that he had made to the President. \xc2\xa0I suspect he did that because he was facing direct questioning under oath from members of Congress, and so he\xe2\x80\x99s in a little different position than I am. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss the advice that the President receives from his commanders on the ground. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We can put you under oath. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That won\xe2\x80\x99t be necessary. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to protect the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to communicate confidentially not just with his military commanders on the ground, but by others who will be a part of this decision, including leaders in the intelligence community, leaders in the diplomatic community, our NATO allies, and, of course, the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team here in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Syria and Russia, question for you. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry said -- comments made over the weekend by Bashar al Assad about a political transition in Syria not taking place until the terrorists, as he defined them, are defeated. \xc2\xa0Kerry said that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdirectly contrary to an agreement that President Putin made with President Obama.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Those are his words, \xe2\x80\x9can agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of what that agreement was? \xc2\xa0And has Putin violated it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think this is what the -- this was the readout of the meeting between the two presidents that U.S. officials shared with all of you, which is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It sounded like they spoke past each other at the time. \xc2\xa0This makes it sound like they actually came to a common understanding on something.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me try to explain to you what transpired. \xc2\xa0Both President Putin and President Obama agreed on the need for a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0There was unanimity of opinion on both sides of that table that there\xe2\x80\x99s no military solution that could be imposed on Syria; that at the root of all of its problems was a significant political problem inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And that is something that the two leaders agreed on.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, where they parted ways was on the most effective way to resolve that political problem. \xc2\xa0President Putin has obviously cast his lot with Bashar al Assad. \xc2\xa0We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s a losing bet. \xc2\xa0And, unfortunately, the Russians have made a decision to carry out the kind of military action that makes clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to double down on that bet. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has long made the case -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty persuasive case when you consider the facts on the ground -- that Bashar al Assad has lost legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0And I say that not just because he\xe2\x80\x99s offended our moral sensibilities by carrying out acts of violence against innocent Syrian civilians, but also because there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to expect the innocent Syrian civilians who have been on the receiving end of those violent attacks are going to tolerate him continuing to lead the country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just an unreasonable proposition, and it certainly calls into question the success of any political transition if Bashar al Assad is going to remain in power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But some of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying makes it sounds like there is a luxury of time in waiting to see how this plays out on the ground. \xc2\xa0But at the same time, while the White House says that the preferred approach has to be diplomacy -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s military-to-military talks or if it\xe2\x80\x99s a political transition -- that is, diplomacy is the foot forward. \xc2\xa0All of that has stalled. \xc2\xa0There are no talks on the calendar, military-to-military or diplomatically at this point. \xc2\xa0One could look at that and say the Russians just appear to be playing for time, tilting the chessboard towards their guy. \xc2\xa0Does the White House walk away thinking that right now? \xc2\xa0Or is the jury still out on whether Putin is following through on this agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, on the military-to-military talks, I would not rule out that there are follow-ups relatively soon to those initial conversations that took place last week. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think there is one premise of your question that I would disagree with -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think President Putin is playing chess, he\xe2\x80\x99s playing checkers. \xc2\xa0And I say that because he\xe2\x80\x99s making a series of tactical decisions that are leading to a starkly negative strategic conclusion, which is that by making the tactical decision to ramp up their support for the Assad regime, Russia is being sucked into a sectarian civil war, essentially a quagmire that poses a whole set of risks to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests not just in the region but back at home. \xc2\xa0And whether that is being further isolated in the international community, pushing off a political solution that even the Russians themselves acknowledge is necessary, and certainly making Russia the target of Sunni Muslims in Syria and in Russia that are quite angry that the Russians have backed up the murderous regime of Bashar al Assad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not ready to close the door on diplomacy at this point in talking to the Russians?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I -- maybe I misunderstood your question. \xc2\xa0Because there was a commitment out of the meeting between the two presidents that there would continue to be these military-to-military talks. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s only been one that\xe2\x80\x99s taken place in the last eight days, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional military-to-military consultations purely at a tactical, practical level. \xc2\xa0And both leaders agreed that Foreign Minister Lavrov and Secretary of State John Kerry would continue to consult on this matter, particularly as it relates to trying to find a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, those kinds of consultations I\xe2\x80\x99m confident will continue. \xc2\xa0I thought the point that you were making -- and the point I think that I was ready to agree with -- is that the broader diplomatic discussions about how to bring about the political transition inside of Syria haven\xe2\x80\x99t made much progress. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not immediately obvious exactly how that political transition will take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe short-term picture at least for those kinds of talks is rather bleak. \xc2\xa0I would acknowledge that. \xc2\xa0But the reason for that, or at least one major contributing factor to that, is that the Russians are propping up the Assad regime and using their military force to do it. \xc2\xa0That is making a political transition much harder to discuss, let alone achieve. \xc2\xa0And again, the reason I point that out is because it\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians themselves who have said that that\xe2\x80\x99s a priority. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for anybody to make the case here that President Putin is in any way marching confidently in the direction of his strategic objectives. \xc2\xa0If anything, he\xe2\x80\x99s marching his army in the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that -- all of this is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria. \xc2\xa0If you sort of take a step back and look at the challenges that are confronting Russia more broadly, their international isolation has led to significant weakness in their economy. \xc2\xa0The international experts project that they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to lose 3 or 4 percent in terms of contracting the size of their economy this year, and that stands in stark contrast to other energy exporters that are projected to grow this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe saw that there was a preliminary agreement between the Russians and the Chinese to build a pipeline that would have been lucrative for the Russians. \xc2\xa0The Chinese have backed away from that project. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of other ways to measure this. \xc2\xa0Capital investment in Russia has fled. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen prominent, or at least well-educated members of the Russian population fleeing Russia and emigrating to other countries because they are concerned about the longer-term trajectory of that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why I would call into question the suggestion that somehow President Putin is advancing the interests of his country by entering into this civil war inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, over the weekend, both Hillary Clinton and Vice President Biden expressed support for the Equality Act, which would allow -- which would amend all areas of federal civil rights law to include LGBT people. \xc2\xa0When the bill was introduced, you said the President shares the goal of the bill but it was still under review here at the White House. \xc2\xa0Are you prepared to say today that President Obama will endorse legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to say that yet. \xc2\xa0This is a piece of legislation that the White House does continue to review. \xc2\xa0There are significant consequences for this bill going into effect. \xc2\xa0It has an impact on housing law and a variety of other policies in the federal government, so it\xe2\x80\x99s something that is still being carefully reviewed by the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I will say, Chris, that the President believes that we must ensure all Americans are treated equally under federal law. \xc2\xa0And the President believes that passage of comprehensive legislation that protects LGBT Americans from discrimination would mark an important step toward that outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we would applaud the efforts of members of Congress to try to advance that goal. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to this specific piece of legislation, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s still under review by the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was the President out of -- was the Vice President out of line with the administration when he said Congress must pass the Equality Act during the Human Rights Campaign dinner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the Vice President was certainly expressing a set of values and views that are consistent with the policies of the administration. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s review of this particular piece of legislation, that\xe2\x80\x99s still ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why is -- review is still ongoing? \xc2\xa0Is it -- what reasons are not to endorse legislation right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s just simply that this particular piece of legislation, the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s written, would have a significant impact across a broad set of policies. \xc2\xa0And so the administration wants to take a careful look to make sure that we understand the broad impact that this particular piece of legislation would have. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is a review that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take two just because --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You can have the last two then. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold off on things like an apology for the hospital attack until the investigation is over. \xc2\xa0There are three ongoing. \xc2\xa0Do you mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to wait until the United States, NATO and the Afghans have finished all three investigations? \xc2\xa0Or is the United States, is the DOD investigation sufficient?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say that at least until more progress has been made in the DOD investigation will be necessary before we take that -- before I have a lot more to say about this. \xc2\xa0But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say that we won\xe2\x80\x99t say anything more until all three investigations are concluded. \xc2\xa0But I have a feeling you guys will keep asking, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely legitimate line of questioning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good instinct. \xc2\xa0And then, wildly unrelated, 36 House members have signed a letter to the Nobel Peace Prize committee urging them to consider Pope Francis as a candidate this year. \xc2\xa0Was wondering, the President, as a past Laureate, whether he supports this campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that you had the opportunity on Friday to hear the President say some very warm things about Pope Francis and the impact that he had on this country when he visited here for the first time. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President is doling out endorsements in the Nobel Peace Prize competition. \xc2\xa0In some ways I think that might even violate the spirit of the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as a Nobel Laureate, he certainly is committed to upholding that spirit. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if the Nobel committee were to choose Pope Francis, that the President would believe that he would be a worthy recipient.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:12 P.M.
