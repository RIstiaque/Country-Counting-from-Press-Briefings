EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for getting on.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been a busy week for all of you and for us, and we appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to your dear friends at the Associated Press, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing this call on the record.\xc2\xa0 So let me give you a quick run of show here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0You have Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor for strategic communications, Liz Sherwood-Randall, special assistant to the President and senior director for European affairs, and Mike Froman, deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs.\xc2\xa0 If I said that too fast, e-mail me and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it to you in a note.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so we will do this call on the record, we will take some Q&amp;A, and then with that I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it over to Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Tommy.\xc2\xa0 I will -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go through the schedule and some of the principal objectives of the trip, and then Liz will be able to speak about our broader approach to Europe, and then Mike can run through the G8 portion of the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a very important trip for the President to reaffirm our core alliances in the world, our European allies.\xc2\xa0 When he came into office, as you know, a principal goal was strengthening those alliances and restoring America\xe2\x80\x99s standing.\xc2\xa0 And we traveled quite a bit to Europe in the first year that we were in office and now this is the first multi-stop trip that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to Europe in some time, since early in his first year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to coordinate and align our approaches on a number of issues.\xc2\xa0 Just about everything that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in the world we\xe2\x80\x99re collaborating closely with our European allies.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also of course an important opportunity to underscore the ties between the United States and Europe that are grounded in interests and values but also large populations that live in the United States that have heritage back in a number of the countries that the President is visiting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our first stop on the trip is Ireland, and one of the people who has heritage in Ireland in the United States is, of course, the President.\xc2\xa0 We arrive in Dublin on Monday morning, and the first event will be a meeting between the President and the First Lady, with President McAleese and her husband as well, an important opportunity to discuss both bilateral issues with President McAleese and also to honor her extraordinary legacy of serving the people of Ireland and advancing peace in Northern Ireland as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After that, the President will meet with the Taoiseach -- again, this will be with the First Lady -- to discuss a range of bilateral issues.\xc2\xa0 Then the President will travel to Moneygall, Ireland, which is the town in Ireland from which the President\xe2\x80\x99s ancestors came.\xc2\xa0 So this is a homecoming of sorts for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very excited to see this small town in Ireland from which he has roots, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very much looking forward to seeing some of the people of Moneygall and making a stop there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll return to Dublin, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to deliver remarks at a public event about the ties between the United States and Ireland.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We spend the night in Dublin that night, and the next day, Tuesday, the 24th, travel to London.\xc2\xa0 The United States and the United Kingdom, of course, enjoy a special relationship.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no closer ally for the United States in the world than the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 And we are coordinating with them and closely aligned with them on issues ranging from our efforts in Afghanistan, our counterterrorism efforts, our ongoing efforts in Libya, our G20 -- broader G20 agenda, and our nonproliferation activities, just to name a few.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we are in absolute alignment with the British on a range of core national security interests and of course deeply share a set of values that have tied us together for many decades.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a state visit for the President so he will begin by arriving at Buckingham Palace, where he is very much looking forward to seeing the Queen and the Duke, who will be hosting him for this visit.\xc2\xa0 After a range of arrival activities, he will have lunch with the Queen and the two U.S. and U.K. delegations.\xc2\xa0 Then he will go to Westminster Abbey for a range of events associated with the state visit, including a wreath-laying ceremony there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After that, we expect that he\'ll be able to see briefly Prime Minister Cameron -- the full bilateral program is the next day, though -- and pay a call on the opposition leader, the Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then that night there is a dinner for the President and the First Lady that is being hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next day, Wednesday, the 25th, the President will have a full bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 There they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss the agenda that I referenced -- I expect Afghanistan, counterterrorism, Iran, Libya, the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arab -- events in the Middle East and the Arab -- Middle East and North Africa will certainly be on the agenda, and so it will be an opportunity for the President to discuss some of the ideas he put forward in his speech yesterday, because we\'ve been closely coordinating with the United Kingdom throughout the last several months, obviously with regard to Libya, but also with our broader support for democratic movements in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 So this will be an important opportunity to discuss that set of issues as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following that bilateral meeting, the President and the Prime Minister will be able to drop by an event that\xe2\x80\x99s being hosted by Mrs. Cameron and the First Lady to honor both military families, U.S. and U.K. service members and veterans.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- of course, the U.S. and the U.K. have served together in many conflicts.\xc2\xa0 Over the last several years, the United Kingdom has served alongside the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has made enormous sacrifices in those conflicts alongside us.\xc2\xa0 So we felt it is important to honor that sacrifice and to discuss some of the ways that both of our countries can support our troops and military families.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After that, the two leaders will hold a press conference.\xc2\xa0 Following that press conference, the President will deliver a speech to the U.K. Parliament.\xc2\xa0 This will be the kind of anchor speech of this trip to Europe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great honor for the President to be able to address the Parliament.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss both the alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom and the interests and values that that alliance is rooted in, as well as the broader trans-Atlantic alliance and an imperative of the United States and Europe retaining and strengthening our cooperation around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the speech to Parliament, the President will reciprocate the hospitality of the Queen and he will hold a dinner in her honor at Winfield House, which is the residence of the American ambassador in London.\xc2\xa0 So, a busy day on day two.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then on Thursday, May 26, the President will travel from London to Deauville, France for the G8 meetings.\xc2\xa0 Mike will speak at greater length about the G8 agenda.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add a few additional meetings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We expect that the President will hold a bilateral meeting with President Medvedev of Russia.\xc2\xa0 As you know, one of the core foreign policy objectives when we came into office was the Russia reset.\xc2\xa0 It has been one of the most productive relationships for the United States in terms of the signing and ratification of the New START treaty, cooperation on nuclear security, cooperation with regard to Iran sanctions, and nonproliferation generally, the northern distribution network into Afghanistan that supports our effort there, and our discussions with Russia about expanding trade ties and their interest in joining the WTO, as well as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s increased cooperation with NATO that was manifested by the NATO-Russia meetings in Lisbon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we have a broad agenda with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 The President has a very close working relationship with President Medvedev, so we see this as an important meeting to advance the agenda between our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the bilateral meeting with Russia, he will enter into the G8 meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to Mike to work through that set of meetings on the first day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second day in Deauville, on the 27th -- Friday, May 27th -- we expect the President to have a bilateral meeting with President Sarkozy of France.\xc2\xa0 We obviously coordinate very closely with France on the full range of issues that are before us, including, of course, our efforts in Afghanistan and Libya.\xc2\xa0 And similarly, there\xe2\x80\x99s great interest in coordination with regard to the events in the Middle East and North Africa more generally.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To that end I\xe2\x80\x99ll also note -- and Mike can speak at greater length -- that we expect the G8 to continue to discuss the ideas that the President laid out in his speech surrounding international support for Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the support of international institutions for democratic transitions, and the G8 more generally.\xc2\xa0 So we expect that those will be topics in the bilateral meeting with President Sarkozy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then there are G8 meetings -- one additional bilateral meeting that we currently have scheduled is one with Prime Minister Kan of Japan.\xc2\xa0 Japan has come through a very difficult period.\xc2\xa0 The United States has provided substantial support for our Japanese ally, both in terms of the provision of certain types of assistance.\xc2\xa0 Our military has helped get assistance to the people of Japan when they were in need following the tsunami.\xc2\xa0 And of course we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided advice and technical cooperation surrounding the nuclear challenges that they face.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So this will be an opportunity to reaffirm the strength of our Japanese alliance and to hear from Prime Minister Kan about the situation in Japan, but also to discuss Japan\xe2\x80\x99s global interests and responsibilities, as well, as they have been a key partner, for instance, in providing assistance in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 They, too, have a strong role to play in supporting the type of democratic values that we stand for around the world, as well as coordination around the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the three meetings that we currently have scheduled on the margins of the G8 are President Medvedev, President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Kan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll, of course, let you know if additional meetings are scheduled.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I mentioned, Mike will go through the G8 schedule, but we leave that evening to go to Poland.\xc2\xa0 Poland is a very important stop for the President for a number of reasons.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Poland is one of our key allies in Eastern and Central Europe, which has been a focal point of the President to strengthen European security during his term in office.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Liz will speak to that.\xc2\xa0 We have deep and longstanding ties with the Polish people, rooted in their democracy, rooted in the large Polish American population, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that night in Poland -- and Liz will probably speak to this -- but we also expect that the two Presidents will host a dinner for the heads of state of Central and Eastern Europe who will be in Poland for a summit at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So just as the President was able to have a dinner with a number of Central and Eastern European leaders when he was in Prague to sign the START treaty, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to consult broadly with our Central and Eastern European partners at this dinner.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an important opportunity to get a lot of business done associated with European security and global issues that we cooperate with our Eastern and Central European allies on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then on Saturday, May 28th, the President will have a bilateral meeting in the morning with the President of Poland.\xc2\xa0 This will be an opportunity to discuss the bilateral agenda with the Poles that, again, includes issues related to NATO, European security, economic cooperation, and a host of other issues that we can get into.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re also going to discuss democracy and, again, the events in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 There is a Polish delegation that recently traveled in the region, traveled to Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 And Lech Walesa, for instance, is one of the members of that delegation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to read out that travel to the two Presidents and -- as well as efforts to support democracy in Belarus, which of course has had a very troubling series of events in the course of the last several months since their election.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two Presidents will then I think deliver remarks at the conclusion of that event.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then the President will go into a working lunch and bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Poland.\xc2\xa0 Again, expect a very wide-ranging discussion on issues that we work with the Poles on.\xc2\xa0 And then the two leaders will hold a joint press conference at the conclusion of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Then we anticipate the President will make a number of cultural stops in -- while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Warsaw.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working out the precise details of those stops, but we expect him to be able to go to several places in Warsaw that are resonant to Polish history and to the extraordinary sacrifices of the Polish people in terms of -- in pursuit of their own freedom.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information as we nail down those stops, but I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate the President making up to two or three cultural stops while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Warsaw.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that element of the schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Liz.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MS. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:\xc2\xa0 So thorough I don\'t have a lot to add, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hello to all out there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add a little bit thematically about the arc of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to\xc2\xa0 Europe since the beginning of the administration and, indeed, before he became President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He as a candidate made a strong commitment to revitalizing our alliances, as Ben said, and to repairing America\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and moral standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 And this trip very much underscores the extent to which he has achieved that with our closest allies and partners in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we look at the themes of the trip there are essentially three.\xc2\xa0 One is to highlight our enduring commitment to Europe because European security and prosperity benefit the United States as much as they do Europe.\xc2\xa0 Europe is our essential partner based on the values we share, and we see that every day as we look at the developments across the broader Middle East; that these values that have undergirded our partnership with Europe and which, indeed, were the values that led to the development of the special relationship as we and the United Kingdom defended democracy against tyranny at the -- in the middle of the 20th century and earlier in the 20th century, are very much the values that others aspire to today.\xc2\xa0 And so it only strengthens and reinforces that bond that we have with Europe as we confront the challenges of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second theme of this trip is to highlight the vitality of the transatlantic link through the institutions of Europe with which we work every day.\xc2\xa0 The President has invested a great deal in ensuring that NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is modernized and relevant to the challenges of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As you know from the Lisbon Summit commitments last year, there is a whole program in place to ensure that NATO has the capabilities that we need to make Article 5 of the treaty relevant to the threats and to ensure that we are prepared to defend all allies, as he has committed to doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that\'s part of the message that we take to Central and Eastern Europe, the reassurance message, to those who were once new allies, but as the President has said repeatedly, there are no old or new allies, there are only allies, and each ally needs to be absolutely confident of the commitment that we\'ve made to their defense.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Also in institutional relationships, we have a strong and vital relationship with the European Union.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve never done more business with the European Union than we do today.\xc2\xa0 Across the board we\'re engaged with them.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve just announced, for example, significant new sanctions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 This is something we\'ve been working on very closely with them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true with regard to Syria; it\xe2\x80\x99s true with regard to counterterrorism cooperation; it\xe2\x80\x99s true with regard to democracy issues in Eastern European; as Ben noted, with respect to Belarus.\xc2\xa0 And just every day the work together with the EU is practical and relevant to the advancement of American interests.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll be highlighting that on the trip as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And third, and perhaps most important, is the growing cooperation that we have with Europe as a catalyst for global action.\xc2\xa0 There, rooted in the shared values and interests with Europe, we see across the board -- in Afghanistan, on Libya, in response to the transformational events in the Middle East and North Africa -- every day we work together with Europe.\xc2\xa0 And there is no other grouping of countries with which we work as closely to advance the President\xe2\x80\x99s global agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So as Ben noted in each of the bilateral meetings, as well as in the G8 meetings that Mike is going to describe, our agenda with Europe is broad and looking outward together in the same direction.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Liz.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Mike now for the G8.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Well, this year the G8 meeting, which is hosted by President Sarkozy, will take place in Deauville, in Normandy, on Thursday and Friday of next week.\xc2\xa0 And obviously in addition to France and the U.S., participants will include the U.K., Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada, Russian and the European Union.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The G process started in Rambouillet, France actually in 1975.\xc2\xa0 And as it has evolved, the G8 has been a leading forum for international cooperation across a wide of issues:\xc2\xa0 economic, political, security and development.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this year will be very much building on that legacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first day of the G8 there will be a discussion.\xc2\xa0 It will start with a discussion of the situation in Japan, expressing solidarity with the people of Japan, and a discussion of nuclear safety, nuclear power safety more generally.\xc2\xa0 There will be a discussion of the global economy and the situation of the global recovery, of risks to that global recovery, as well as a dialogue around trade and climate change and advancing those agendas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0President Sarkozy has organized a discussion of the various drivers of the economy, including the Internet, green growth innovation, and there will be an opportunity for the leaders to have dialogue with representatives of a conference that will be going on in Paris the day before the G8 of business leaders and others involved in Internet-related issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The G8 leaders will talk about a range of political and security issues.\xc2\xa0 Traditionally this has included everything from nonproliferation, North Korea, Iran, terrorism, drug trafficking, piracy.\xc2\xa0 This year there will also be, in a sense, a discussion of the developments in the Middle East and North Africa as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And that will lead to the second day, where the leaders will be joined in one session by the prime ministers of Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the head of the World Bank, the U.N. Secretary General, and representatives from the IMF to discuss the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And this perhaps will be the -- one of the most important outcomes of the G8, which is that we expect there to be a broad embrace of an approach to the Middle East and North Africa that includes many of the elements that the President laid out in his speech yesterday about supporting financial stabilization; modernization and reform of the economies in the region to support private sector growth, entrepreneurship and job creation; and further integration both regionally and with the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And finally, the G8 summit will end with two sessions in which the G8 leaders will meet with nine leaders from African countries -- Algeria, C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea-Conakry, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa.\xc2\xa0 And this is continuing a tradition that the G8 has had of having a dialogue with Africa about development issues but also about political and security issues.\xc2\xa0 And that will conclude the G8 after that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 One quick housekeeping thing.\xc2\xa0 By popular demand, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just repeat these titles.\xc2\xa0 First speaker is Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor for strategic communications.\xc2\xa0 Our second speaker was Liz Sherwood-Randall, senior director for European affairs and special assistant to the President.\xc2\xa0 And third was Mike Froman, deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs.\xc2\xa0 And with that we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for taking the time to do the call, and thank you for your service.\xc2\xa0 My question is about Poland.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the number one agenda item on the Polish side is their request to join the State Department visa waiver program.\xc2\xa0 During the Polish President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Washington in December, President Obama promised to make this a priority and solve this issue \xe2\x80\x9cbefore very long.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell us what progress can the President report on the drive to admit Poland to the visa waiver program, and what has the administration done since December to achieve this goal?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, Josh, for that question.\xc2\xa0 I do think that this is a lead agenda item between the two countries.\xc2\xa0 As you said, the President had this discussion several months ago with his Polish counterpart, committed to do more work on this.\xc2\xa0 Since then, we have been working this very hard and have made progress on a number of fronts as it relates to the core issue, the visa waiver program, and additional issues associated with the Polish people and their ability to work and study and visit here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in conversations within the administration about this for some time.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, we believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say, I think about this, when we\xe2\x80\x99re in Poland.\xc2\xa0 The President will be able to specifically -- the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken and the roadmap that we see.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re following through on our commitment to be responsive to Polish concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have particular announcements today, but we have been working and we do feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved the ball forward, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss this further while we\xe2\x80\x99re in Poland.\xc2\xa0 There are, of course, very important issues associated with the visa waiver program that have to be looked at carefully.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a simple matter.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly expect it to be an agenda item in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings in Warsaw and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to update the Poles on the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to date around this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy expectation is that this problem will be solved during my presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did he mean by the end of 2012 or the end of 2016?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this again.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s working to follow through on that precise commitment that you referenced, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing this in Warsaw and have more to say there.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we -- the President does intend to follow through on his commitment to work this issue to a resolution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 A question on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Can I check the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973?\xc2\xa0 The part about -- the wording of \xe2\x80\x9call necessary measures,\xe2\x80\x9d do you think that that allows the arming of the Libyan rebels?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how and when should that happen?\xc2\xa0 And if not, then generally how can the goal of removing Qaddafi from power be speeded up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the United States pushed very hard for a resolution that framed the effort of civilian protection in Libya around \xe2\x80\x9call necessary measures\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, we believe that the force sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution is focused on the civilian protection mission, and that ranges from a number of steps to include the no-fly zone, but also, of course, to include striking targets on the ground that endanger Libyan civilians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And NATO and our coalition partners have carried out that mission very effectively over the course of the last several weeks and have stopped the advances of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces, and in some instances they\xe2\x80\x99ve been reversed through NATO and coalition actions and through the actions of the Libyan opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With regard to your -- the second part of your question about arming the opposition, we believe that different nations are going to make different judgments about their own relationship with the Libyan opposition, separate and apart from the United Nations Security Council resolution.\xc2\xa0 The United States, for instance, has provided non-lethal assistance to the Libyan opposition.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve deepened our ties with the Transitional National Council, including through meetings here at the White House with National Security Advisor Tom Donilon several days ago, several meetings that Hillary Clinton has had with the Council, and having an envoy, Chris Stevens, who\xe2\x80\x99s in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other nations will make other decisions about the type of assistance that they will provide.\xc2\xa0 Some could go further than the United States in terms of arms.\xc2\xa0 But again, we believe that these are national decisions to be made within the context of our efforts to protect Libyan civilians and support the opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, with regard to Qaddafi, I think the President spoke to this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We believe that time is now working against Qaddafi.\xc2\xa0 His advance was stopped.\xc2\xa0 His forces have been significantly degraded.\xc2\xa0 He is cut off from access to arms and cash from the first U.N. Security Council Resolution 1970, as well as 1973.\xc2\xa0 And you see a number of Libyan regime officials, for instance, looking for a way out as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So at the same time that Qaddafi is being pressured and squeezed by the international community, the Libyan opposition has time and space to organize itself, to obtain more resources, and to become a more effective body.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s been borne out in events on the ground in recent days as, again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Qaddafi under greater pressure, having lost control of different portions of his country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So as the President said yesterday, we believe that he has -- he will not benefit from the passage of time but rather, the day in which he inevitably leaves will become more likely as time goes on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that\'s our broad position, and Libya, we expect, will be an important topic of discussion throughout our stops in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to hear demands or requests, rather, from Sarkozy and from David Cameron for the U.S. to do more, either in a background role or in a frontline role?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Liz.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MS. SHERWOOD-RANDALL:\xc2\xa0 The President and David Cameron have an ongoing conversation about ensuring enforcement of the U.N. Security Council resolution, and we work together both bilaterally and in NATO to make the most of the capabilities that have been committed to the operation.\xc2\xa0 And they have a very, very effective relationship.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it in their meeting, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do, as Ben said, to make the most of this time to show Qaddafi that time is not on his side.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 My question is about the IMF.\xc2\xa0 To what extent do you think the discussion about a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be brought up at the G8 and in the other meetings that the President will be having?\xc2\xa0 And can you articulate what criteria the United States would like to see used in choosing that successor?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll pass this to Mike.\xc2\xa0 I will just note, for the benefit of the group, that I myself was deeply impressed by the knowledge that Mike dropped on the origin of the G grouping.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s a G buff himself, but I think he can talk to the IMF as well.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jeff, from Reuters.\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the IMF may very well come up in conversations during the trip.\xc2\xa0 And as Secretary Geithner expressed yesterday, our view is that the IMF has an experienced leadership team in place right now during this critical time for the global economy to help manage the smooth transition.\xc2\xa0 And with regard to a new head, we want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession for the fund\xe2\x80\x99s new managing director.\xc2\xa0 And that -- I imagine that will be a subject of discussion among some of the leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 My question is about Ireland.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- does he still have -- you said he has family there?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to meet cousins or family?\xc2\xa0 And the other point of the G8 agenda, it sounds like a mini-G20.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s eventually useful to have that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hey, thanks for the question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first part, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it over to Mike, I think, on the G8.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President, researching his background, was able to trace his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side of the family back to Ireland, and specifically to Moneygall.\xc2\xa0 I believe that it is -- we could confirm this -- but I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a great-great-grandfather -- three greats.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So he has roots in Ireland and in Moneygall.\xc2\xa0 Moneygall is a town of under 300 people in Ireland.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports about the bloodlines that extend across the town and people who may be related to the President.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly quite likely that in a town of that size that is so deeply rooted in that part of Ireland that there are people who share those ties.\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say with certainty who -- the nature of those relations, but we certainly expect it to be a robust topic of discussion with the residents of Moneygall when the President is able to stop by and pay a visit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it to Mike on the G8 question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 On the G question, I think the G8 and the G20 play distinct roles.\xc2\xa0 The G20, obviously, with the larger membership and the presence of the major emerging economies, is the premier forum for international economic cooperation and is the forum through which we deal with a number of the key issues around rebalancing financial regulation, et cetera.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The G8 will focus largely on political security and development issues.\xc2\xa0 And to the degree that it talks about the global economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the context of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Europe currently and the United States currently, as well as Japan, and it\xe2\x80\x99s just an opportunity for those leaders to share views on the current state of the global recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I may follow up on this, do you consider you have the same vision as Europe towards rebalancing towards China?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad consensus within the G20 on the importance of global rebalancing, including encouraging more domestic demand in the major surplus countries of -- in the major surplus countries and increasing savings in the major deficit countries.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all on the same page on that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 My question is about the intensity or the depth of discussions between the President and Prime Minister Cameron regarding the pre-\xe2\x80\x9967 borders and the land swap.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We consult on a very regular basis with Prime Minister Cameron on issues associated with Middle East peace.\xc2\xa0 Most of the conversations they have I think it comes up.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ve been coordinating with them through the Quartet and on a bilateral basis over the course of the last several months.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly expect that President Obama will have an opportunity to discuss Middle East peace, to discuss his statements yesterday that the basis and foundation for successful negotiations should begin with territorial security to include the 1967 borders plus swaps as a basis on territory, and to include affirmation and assurances related to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, having stated that as a U.S. position yesterday, we do believe that he will discuss the issue.\xc2\xa0 However, he\'ll do it in a broader context of a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 I know they want to discuss the democratic movement in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 They want to discuss Syria, Libya, Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So I think, as it was in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, I think it will be one of many issues that comes up in their discussions on the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the international community, through the Quartet and through the U.S.-U.K. relationship, does what it can to advance progress in pursuit of peace, and so we believe that alignment between the U.S. and the U.K., and the U.S. and our Quartet partners, continues to be important going forward.\xc2\xa0 So the President will have an opportunity to pursue that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Ben, you talked about the London speech being sort of the anchor of the trip, so can you say a little bit more about the Dublin public speech?\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be sort of more -- maybe more personal, or is it very Irish -- Irish-centric?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Scott, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 The Dublin remarks I think will be very Irish-focused.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance to talk about the relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a chance to talk about the enormous affinity, frankly, that the American people have for Ireland that\xe2\x80\x99s rooted in part in the huge population of Irish-Americans here.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for the President to really celebrate the ties between our countries and the kind of unique feelings that the American people have for Ireland, and hopefully that the Irish people have had with the United States for many years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, again, I think that is a very -- a speech very much focused on Ireland and the United States and Ireland and the ties between our peoples, rather than, for instance, a statement of -- extended statement on policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Then, in the U.K., I think that there the President is going to take on a broader set of themes.\xc2\xa0 That will include the U.S./U.K. special relationship.\xc2\xa0 It will also include the importance of the transatlantic alliance in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the President to underscore that the alliance between the United States and the U.K. and the alliance between the U.S. and Europe is as important as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been.\xc2\xa0 We see that because of the breadth of issues that we cooperate on, whether, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan or Libya or the G20 or nuclear issues, for instance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we also see it in the fact that we are bound by a set of values.\xc2\xa0 And the President spoke at length about those values yesterday -- democracy, individual rights, self-determination -- so that at a time when we see people reaching for those values around the world, it reaffirms the importance of having the U.S. and Europe consistently speaking up for those rights, taking policy steps to support the advancement of those rights and, again, leading not just based upon a set of narrow interests of nations but leading on behalf of a set of rights that we believe should be claimed by all people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to hit on those themes in his speech, just as he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss the substantive issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re working on with the United Kingdom and our European allies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for joining the call and we look forward to speaking more on the trip.\xc2\xa0 I know, as I said, there will be at least, in addition to the couple of sets of public remarks, a couple of press conferences, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on any additions to the schedule, as well as the three bilateral meetings in the G8 printout.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So thanks, everyone, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 10:20 A.M.
