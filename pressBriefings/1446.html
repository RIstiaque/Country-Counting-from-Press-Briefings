GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before we -- well, let\'s just get started.\xc2\xa0 I want to go through just a little bit of what the President -- feedback I got from the President on this afternoon\'s -- or this morning\'s meeting with bank executives.</p>\n<p>The President believed that the meeting was positive and constructive.\xc2\xa0 The President opened the meeting by wanting to talk about four specific areas:\xc2\xa0 credit and lending was one, second was housing, the third was executive comp, and the fourth was financial reform.</p>\n<p>The bankers all acknowledged that they could do more in these efforts.\xc2\xa0 And one banker said, "You caused us to look more broadly" at our lending.\xc2\xa0 All of the bankers -- (laughter) -- all of the bankers discussed the notion of instituting second looks at loans that had been turned down.\xc2\xa0 And as I think you all have seen Bank of America discussing their desire to see $5 billion more in lending in 2010.</p>\n<p>The bankers had good suggestions for streamlining the SBA loan process and paperwork requirements that come with those.\xc2\xa0 The bankers acknowledged the compensation -- they had problems with compensation, that they were taking steps on say-on-pay and on long-term equity versus short-term cash.\xc2\xa0 The President said that it is in this environment it wasn\'t just -- it wasn\'t simply the structure, but also the amount that strongly mattered to the American people.</p>\n<p>Lastly, on financial reform, all of the executives discussed their support for the concept of financial reform.\xc2\xa0 The President said clearly that he and the administration were hearing something markedly different from their lobbyists and from organizations that they funded to lobby on their behalf.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that financial reform was a big priority to him and to the American people, to ensure that the crisis we saw never happens again, and he suggested that they find ways to be more vocal about the support that they discussed on financial reform.</p>\n<p>So that is a quick rundown of notes from that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll start with Mr. Hurst.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, moving off that topic to Afghanistan, General Rodriguez said today that it\'s now going to take nine to 11 months to move the 30,000 troops pulling into Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the impression I think left after the President\'s speech at West Point said this was something that was going to be happening within six months.\xc2\xa0 What\'s happened there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to the remarks that Secretary Gates and others made in testifying in front of Congress, that the bulk of our forces would be in by the beginning of the summer, and that the remainder would be in by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning almost the end of September, then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the end of August I think was the date that we had originally talked about.\xc2\xa0 So I would point you to what Secretary Gates said, and if there are some internal discrepancies about that then best directed toward people in the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>I think the President strongly believes and all those that participated in the meetings agreed that the President\'s proposal got more troops into Afghanistan faster than any other force option that he was presented with.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the policy he chose.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it should extend to 11 months -- that was the end point General Rodriguez put on it -- would that still be the fastest --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would go back and ask Secretary Gates -- I don\'t want to contradict testimony he gave in front of the Senate and the House, which obviously put that on a different timeline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this disturbing to the President then, this possible extension?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes we should get our troops in there by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting with the bankers, did it become clear why they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been lending as much as you would like them to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'ll let them discuss their business practices.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes, as you heard him say after the meeting and as you heard him say throughout the weekend, and others in the administration -- that bankers have to play a constructive role in getting our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 I think the President took some heart that the bankers themselves said that this meeting and past meetings have caused them to look more closely at things like lending.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly take them at their word on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you feel like you have a firm commitment from them to help spur more lending to small businesses?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have a firm commitment from them -- they all mentioned, again, ensuring that second looks would be given to loans that had been turned down.\xc2\xa0 You saw again a specific announcement by Bank of America on an increased amount of lending in 2010 to small and medium-sized business.</p>\n<p>I think the President certainly believes that one of the important areas to get our economy moving again is to ensure that small and medium-sized businesses that are creditworthy -- you heard the President say nobody wants to go back to an era where people are making loans to individuals that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them\xc2\xa0 -- but the President\'s feeling, and I think it sounded like the bankers as well, was that there are certainly people that are creditworthy and need help in getting our economy unstuck through more credit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned the CitiGroup payback.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect -- you said you expect more institutions to follow up.\xc2\xa0 How soon should we expect that?\xc2\xa0 Is something imminent from some other banks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of their discussions with their different regulators.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is -- continues to be pleased not simply that we\'re getting that money back from institutions, but more importantly, that the taxpayers are seeing that come back with interest.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why you saw announcements last week that the amount that the administration believes is likely necessary from TARP shrank by $200 billion from last week to where the Midsession Review was at the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Jake.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A year ago the President said that he thought Wall Street bankers should forego Christmas bonuses.\xc2\xa0 Largely it did not.\xc2\xa0 In January he called those bonuses shameful.\xc2\xa0 In March he met with a bunch of bankers, some of the same ones.\xc2\xa0 And they came out and said some of the same things:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got to have this discussion; we\'re going to look at some of the things the President said.\xc2\xa0 Since then the President has made it very clear that he\'s not happy with the way things are going, that the loans are not happening.\xc2\xa0 You just said we\'re going to take the bankers at their word.\xc2\xa0 Why would you take them at their word?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can only take at what they said, Jake.\xc2\xa0 What the President is going to do is continue to ensure that we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 I think the President would say, if you look at what is happening with -- again, I don\'t want to speak broadly for every banker, but I think if you look at -- I think the President would say that when an institution decides to forego a cash bonus in lieu of increased long-term equity in the company that does invest for a four-year period of time, that that was precisely the type of solution that he was talking about earlier this year -- that if we take the short-term cash out of this system that can be much more closely rigged toward risk and instead say your compensation should be termed -- should be attached to the long-term health and growth of your company, which is good for you and taxpayers, that represents the type of progress that the President would like to see.</p>\n<p>Again, I think the bankers all acknowledged that they have work to do on this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated that, and discussed again that it wasn\'t, as I said earlier, it wasn\'t just the -- it\'s not just the structure; it is also the amount.\xc2\xa0 I think they all should be cognizant of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point should the American people hold the President responsible for the fact that the banks are not doing what the President keeps telling them to do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jake, I want to be clear that the President doesn\'t want to run a bank.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the American people took some extraordinary steps to ensure their financial stability, and ultimately the larger economy\'s financial stability.</p>\n<p>The President will simply -- will hear what he -- will listen to what he hears in these meetings -- and he said at the beginning he wanted to listen more than he wanted to talk, and I think that was largely the case.\xc2\xa0 He opened the meeting up with about 15 minutes that I walked you through.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ll continue to evaluate the progress that we make, whether it is taking a second look at these loans, whether it\'s making a specific recommendation to increase, by $5 billion, loans to small and medium-sized business, to take compensation issues seriously; and quite frankly, maybe most importantly, the House passed on Friday a very important financial reform bill out of the House, which now goes to the Senate.</p>\n<p>The President and his team strongly believe that there are aspects that are crucial to ensuring the type of fiasco that we had happen in September of 2008 never happens again.\xc2\xa0 If as the President heard around that table today, they\'re broadly supportive of financial reform, I think the President was pretty clear with them that that needs to be communicated from their lobbyists to the broader Senate, so that we can get something done and to ensure that that never happens again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\'s take that housing program that the President unveiled in Mesa, Arizona in February.\xc2\xa0 He said it was going to help -- one specific section of it, not the Fannie/Freddie part of it -- was going to help 3 to 4 million homes, help these mortgage holders renegotiate or refinance.\xc2\xa0 About 760,000 Americans have applied, and the banks have given, like, 31,000 roughly Americans are enrolled in that -- 31,000 and the President had as a goal 3 to 4 million.\xc2\xa0 Now, we talked to some of the bankers out there, and they --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me get some updated statistics.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not entirely --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are updated.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- not entirely sure that those are -- that\'s the number of people taking place in modifications.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) So in any case, moving on, the bankers -- I got them from Psaki, so --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bankers said that the problem with the program is the paperwork, there\'s too much paperwork.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I -- look, that came up in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I said that there was an acknowledgment that we would -- that the President and his team would look at the paperwork requirements in streamlining these type of things.\xc2\xa0 They mentioned specifically both housing modifications and SBA loans.\xc2\xa0 The President -- look, the President took notes throughout the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that he\'ll discuss with his team -- in the event that the housing modification program is being held back because of onerous paperwork requirements, that we\'ll streamline those paperwork requirements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s what it is, and not the fact that the banks don\'t want to loan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to speak broadly for all the banks.\xc2\xa0 I know the President\'s position is it is far more preferable to keep somebody in a house and to figure out the best way for them to ultimately meet, through a modification, their mortgage and their loan requirements; that that is far preferable in any economic situation.\xc2\xa0 Quite frankly, it\'s more beneficial for banks to have somebody paying that loan than to have a house that they can\'t put anybody in.</p>\n<p>Again, we will work with anybody in terms of streamlining the number -- the paperwork requirements if there are those that believe that\'s the onerous part of this program.</p>\n<p>Again, the President was very clear in that, again, housing was one of the main things that he wanted to discuss.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are some banks in there that don\'t do mortgages, but certainly there were some in there that do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I just wonder if there are citizens watching this and they see the President for the last year say he\'s going to give stern talk, going to give tough talk to bankers; meanwhile, taxpayers are giving them hundreds of billions of dollars, and nothing changes.\xc2\xa0 The housing modification program is only helping 31,000 Americans, not the 3 to 4 million.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to Americans who say this just seems like kabuki theater, this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the President didn\'t have this meeting on accident.\xc2\xa0 The President is as frustrated as the American people are.\xc2\xa0 I think you heard -- I don\'t know if you guys use video from other networks -- I think the tone and the tenor of his remarks in the interview that we taped last week and that was broadcast yesterday night -- last evening -- was pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President minced words.</p>\n<p>I think the President is serious and frustrated, on behalf of the American people, that, as we have all said, the taxpayers ensured the financial stability of many of the people that were in that room and that we should expect that those banks do the same in being part of a positive economic recovery that helps people stay in their homes, which loosens credit for medium and small businesses, which addresses egregious executive comp issues -- and again, maybe the most pressing legislative issue doesn\'t stand in the way of very important financial regulatory reform.</p>\n<p>Again, they all said that.\xc2\xa0 The President was clear.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s what you believe, it should be communicated from those that represent your interests on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the tone and tenor of the comments of "60 Minutes" where he called the bankers "fat cats," he said they don\'t get it -- then you come out today and say the President feels the meeting was constructive, it was positive.\xc2\xa0 Were those comments on "60 Minutes" more about beating his chest and kind of tapping a populist rage, or does he want to hold the bankers accountable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President -- the President was clear.\xc2\xa0 Ed, we could -- I don\'t think that begins to enumerate the President\'s frustration.\xc2\xa0 And I think you could be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then where\'s his frustration today?\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying it was positive, constructive; bankers came out, positive, constructive.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the meeting was positive.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- positive in the sense that the President laid out and enumerated quite specifically the concerns that he directly had on four areas.\xc2\xa0 I think the President said the meeting was also quite frank.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t hand out awards.</p>\n<p>The President talked directly to each and every one of those members about the need to increase lending to small and medium-sized businesses.\xc2\xa0 The President talked directly about increasing the volume of loan modifications to keep people in their homes.\xc2\xa0 The President discussed quite clearly the very real concerns that he has and he enumerated last evening, and has for quite some time, about executive compensation -- which is why a say-on-pay is in the financial reform legislation that passed the House last Friday, which the President believes in very important.</p>\n<p>And finally, again largely -- the larger issue of financial regulatory reform, ensuring that steps are in place that make sure what we dealt with which required this extraordinary response from taxpayers never happens again.\xc2\xa0 That is one of the single most important things that we can do going forward, again, to ensure that we\'re never in this position again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another financial issue -- the Senate just passed the $447 billion omnibus spending bill, and it\'s got thousands of earmarks, more than 5,000 earmarks; double-digit increases for various Cabinet departments.\xc2\xa0 Is the President contemplating vetoing this to send a signal to his fellow Democrats that it\'s time to cut the spending?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ve not talked specifically with the President about whether he\'s going to sign the bill or not.\xc2\xa0 I think the likelihood is that keeping the government running is an important thing.\xc2\xa0 I think you see within the legislation that there are -- the number of earmarks is down.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made progress on that.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no doubt we\'ve still got a long way to go, but I think one of the goals obviously is to keep the government functioning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When he signed the omnibus in March he called -- and you called it here last year\'s business that was left over, and he said it was a "departure point for more far-reaching change."</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said that there was a departure point, that omnibus, all of the spending that was left over from the Bush years, was a departure point for real change.\xc2\xa0 So where\'s the change?\xc2\xa0 I mean, now that Democrats have their chance to govern --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I just mentioned that we have seen a decrease by almost 15 percent in the number of earmarks.\xc2\xa0 Again -- and it\'s not perfect.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to make and try to make progress on those issues.\xc2\xa0 The President would like to see Congress get to the point where we\'re doing appropriations bills, not omnibus bills.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would a veto bring that kind of change?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can certainly talk to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I think right now that the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to sign it, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\'t talked to him specifically.\xc2\xa0 That\'s where I\'m led to believe, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\'s encouraged by the decrease in --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s glad we\'re not doing -- we don\'t have the same levels as we had in there before, yes.</p>\n<p>Helen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t the President get a firm commitment from the banks?\xc2\xa0 He got, I assume, smiles and, yes, we agree -- when he gave all this taxpayer money to them?\xc2\xa0 And why did he have to identify the problem on the small loans?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helen, again, the TARP plan, the piece of legislation, is something that -- the requirements of that legislation this President is bound by, passed in a different time.\xc2\xa0 The President believes -- I think clearly, and as I\'ve restated here -- that banks have an obligation to take responsibility for what was caused for their role in that, and to step up to the plate now and be part of positive economic reform and positive economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why aren\'t they giving these loans?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is their problem?\xc2\xa0 Paperwork -- that doesn\'t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\'s what the President wanted to push on.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President had them down, and I think that\'s why you see when they come out and talk about taking different -- taking more looks at these loans, some banks lending out -- and not just Bank of America, but others in previous weeks have talked about specific amounts that they see in the next year that can be lent to small and medium businesses.\xc2\xa0 I think the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'s convinced now that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that\'s a positive step.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President will continue to -- this is -- this wasn\'t the first meeting, this is at least the second meeting that has been had.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why does he have to tell the bankers what the problem was?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did he have to convince the bankers that they weren\'t giving loans?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I don\'t know why he had to do that, but the President was happy to let them know what their responsibilities are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sill doesn\'t sound like he got any kind of commitment for greater loans to small businesses.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I will let them make their own individual announcements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They all had media training, they get out there and babbled and said nothing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m supposed to respond to their media training?\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the opportunity to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking you whether they made a commitment to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They made a commitment to, again, take second looks, to hire more people to process loans -- which, in many cases, they\'ve done -- again, to take those second looks.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve already mentioned at least one today and others in the previous couple of weeks that have announced a greater commitment in the next year in their financial plan to small business loans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You made quite a point of one -- of the foregoing of cash for stock, but that\'s only one institution.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, Bill, did all the world\'s problems get solved today?\xc2\xa0 I can tell you guys, no.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, again, that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be solved overnight.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t get into the problem that caused a financial collapse in September of 2008 by something that happened earlier in September of 2008.\xc2\xa0 This was going on for quite sometime, making loans to people that should never have had loans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President has put in financial reform and called for a very strong consumer protection agency, the likes of which right now the responsibility is spread out over 10 to 12 different agencies to ensure that people aren\'t taken advantage of in terms of teaser loans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they say that they\'d call off the dogs lobbying against financial reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned to them on several occasions that he appreciated that all of them around the table were able to tell the President of the United States they supported financial reform.\xc2\xa0 What he expected them to do was now go tell their lobbyists, and to go tell the agencies and groups that they helped fund that they just told the President they\'re for financial reform.</p>\n<p>I can assure you this, Bill, the President is going to get financial reform.\xc2\xa0 It\'s through the House.\xc2\xa0 He will see it through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we will lay the framework for ensuring that the type of thing that the taxpayers had to make up for as a result of risk-taking that culminated in what happened in September of 2008, that that never happens again.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President will do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, given the President\'s displeasure with lobbyists, would he be willing to issue a moratorium on political contributions from the financial services industry for himself and encourage fellow Democrats to do the same?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t take contributions from lobbyists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about lobbyists, I\'m talking directly from the financial service companies, their executives --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I thought you said lobbyists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that was the predicate, but just from the companies.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to the President about that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President was -- has been pretty clear both in how he financed his campaign in 2008 -- we don\'t take money from political action committees.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\'t take money from registered federal lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 When he became the nominee, the DNC didn\'t do that either.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could he go even further and shun all contributions from Wall Street, and encourage his fellow Democrats --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- well, look, it\'s not -- I think the people that are taking contributions -- most of the people that seem to be taking contributions are the lobbyists that are standing in the way of financial reform.\xc2\xa0 I read -- what was it I read last week, that hundreds of lobbyists were called to Capitol Hill to put the quash by the Republicans on financial reform?\xc2\xa0 That\'s a great question.\xc2\xa0 The next time there\'s a "Today Show" exclusive with Michael Steele like this morning, it\'s a good question to pose to him.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President could set an example.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He did.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\'t take money from lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\'t take money from PACs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, the last thing.\xc2\xa0 Is there something inconsistent or incongruous at all about the fact that the President is encouraging more lending, banks are reluctant, not -- they\'re concerned about the creditworthiness of these small businesses or these individuals, considering the loose lending practices that led us to this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President I think was clear in the statement that he made after the meeting and he was clear in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not looking for -- the solution to this problem is not to give out loans to people that can\'t pay them back.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in many ways what got us into the problem that we\'re dealing with, certainly on the home side, and on credit cards as well.</p>\n<p>What the President gets in talking with people and in the letters that he reads each day are millions -- not millions -- dozens and dozens of letters that I assume represent millions of people -- small businesses that tell the President that they\'ve always been able to get a loan, that they\'re creditworthy and that they ought to be able to now get a loan even as the economy starts to make progress.</p>\n<p>I think what he wanted to do was to ensure that bankers heard that message on behalf of the small business owners throughout this country, some of whom used to be able to get loans and now can\'t.</p>\n<p>But, Savannah, there\'s no doubt that -- the President does not wish to meet the irresponsibility of what led us into that with future irresponsibility with giving loans to people either to pay credit card debt, to buy a house, or any other type of loan of which they don\'t have the wherewithal to pay back.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for the economy, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense, quite frankly, for anybody taking those loans, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for anybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\'s met for an hour except to jawbone them.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he can\'t force them to do anything when they\'re not under TARP, so all you can do is jawbone.\xc2\xa0 What does that get?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it gets specific amounts that banks say they\'re going to lend small businesses next year.\xc2\xa0 I think $5 billion is -- we will watch them to ensure that they come through in their commitment.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something I think the President would believe is important.\xc2\xa0 I think when somebody -- when one of the bankers says to the President that you caused us all to have to take a look at how we lend money and who we lend money to, the President thinks that\'s a positive thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does President Obama now believe that these banking executives get it, when he said on "60 Minutes" that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, again, believes that the meeting was positive, that it was constructive.\xc2\xa0 The important thing is not what somebody says in a meeting but the actions that follow, and that\'s what the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it remains to be seen whether they get it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will evaluate their actions going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on one other subject, how big an increase in the debt limit does the President want?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen what has been specifically called for.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly get from Legislative Affairs if there\'s more information on it.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to run banks, but did he in this meeting talk specifically about some increase in loans, whether by percentage or by a certain deadline?\xc2\xa0 Did he set any benchmarks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\'s important that the President -- the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t also want to be the loan officer either.\xc2\xa0 I think each of these institutions understands -- or should understand from the President what increased lending means.\xc2\xa0 But the President did not lay out a specific benchmark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any legal or regulatory remedies for the White House in case, down the road, you\'re just not satisfied with the improvement in loans?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d certainly have to talk to the lawyers and stuff about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know on the lending side.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are specific legal things that we think can be done on financial reform that the President is in the process of getting through Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a minor question about the President\'s -- the President in his meetings, you mentioned he took notes throughout.\xc2\xa0 What formal way -- are there not note-takers in the meetings who then maybe put these discussions in a memo that goes to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, no, there\'s -- there were at least four of us that were sitting -- were not sitting at the table, all taking copious notes, from NEC, from Treasury, from OPE, and as well as the President, along with Secretary Geithner, Larry Summers, Dr. Romer.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that there\'s a long list of what was talked about in very specific terms.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why does the President believe the banks haven\'t been lending?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s what he wanted to hear from them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he give you a conclusion on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he give a conclusion on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think he\'s -- I think there\'s probably a number of different things.\xc2\xa0 What he hears certainly from some is that -- what was mentioned before, capital requirements, which -- look, I think the President understands, again, we have to take steps to ensure that what happened never happens again.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President also believes that the letters that he gets -- they\'re certainly people that -- people that have traditionally gotten those loans before that ought to be -- that ought to have the same access to the capital that they had when all they\'ve done is play by the rules.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other rules, capital requirements is not a sufficient explanation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think in and of itself, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the words from regulators that it\'s important to have very strong, very defensible loans on your books now a sufficient explanation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Major, I don\'t make --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the bankers cited to us outside --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t think he --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and I want to know if the President evaluates that as a reasonable explanation.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I don\'t think the President -- the President certainly does not want to see coming from this meeting a series of loans to people that can\'t pay them back.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President strongly believes is the letters that he gets and the discussions that he had with small business owners, that there is some happy medium that can be reached where you meet your capital requirements, where you\'re making loans to those that have strong credit histories; yet at the same time there are those that can and should be getting loans that for whatever reason they\'re not.\xc2\xa0 And that was the purpose of -- one of the purposes, as I said, of today\'s meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the recession over?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 According to who?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your economic advisors.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you look at -- look, there\'s -- there\'s a technical --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Romer said no; Larry Summers said yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, Dr. Romer said:\xc2\xa0 You know the official definition that talks about just when do you turn the corner, when do you go from plummeting to finally starting to go back up?\xc2\xa0 I think we have at least in terms of GDP reached that point.\xc2\xa0 Then she went on to say:\xc2\xa0 What I think the President said, and what I firmly believe, we\'ve not -- we\'re not recovered until all those people that want to work are back at work.</p>\n<p>Christy would know, because she sat on the board before coming to the administration, which as you know dates the official beginning and end to economic downturns.</p>\n<p>So what Christy talked about in this answer was there are -- and I think what any economist -- I\'m sure there are many on your network that would tell you it\'s likely the next time this board meets that they\'ll affix a date to the end of a recession from a statistical economic viewpoint that they\'re charged to do.\xc2\xa0 In the President\'s mind, in Dr. Romer\'s mind, in Dr. Summers\' mind, has all that needs to happen happened in order for the American people to bask in the glow of recovery?\xc2\xa0 Obviously not.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why Dr. Romer, Dr. Summers, and others followed up both of those questions by discussing what the administration was doing directly in order to address the job situation.</p>\n<p>I think it\'s safe to say that if we believed all was good in America, we wouldn\'t be talking about increased ways to bring about an environment for the private sector to begin hiring more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate has now said that it would like to expand access to Medicare of those aged 55 and above.\xc2\xa0 That is an alternative approach that the House is taking.\xc2\xa0 Which does the President think is better?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say it one more time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Senate bill on health care wants to provide access to those on Medicare down to age 55.\xc2\xa0 That is a different -- different approach to expanding coverage under the rubric of public option than the House has taken.\xc2\xa0 Which of these two approaches does the President believe is better?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have an opinion?\xc2\xa0 If not, why not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What the President wants to do is see the process through the Senate, continue to make progress, and that\'s what the administration is working toward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I mean, that\'s a rather large systemic change to Medicare, and many budget analysts who are not opposed to health care reform as principle, have said this is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me interrupt --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a potentially large financial --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- because I don\'t want to get ahead of the CBO, because I know the CBO is working on just that, just as the CBO had told you all before that legislation bends the cost curve, that legislation would slow the growth rate in health care spending, that health care legislation wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t add to the deficit, but it would in fact help our fiscal situation.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve seen the CBO talk about the extended life to the Medicare trust fund that legislation that the Senate is currently debating would have in terms of the specific policy.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s what the CBO is evaluating, and I think many on Capitol Hill await what they have to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House agnostic on which approach to a public option is better?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is not agnostic to continue to making progress on health care reform and we\'re trying to get it through the Senate.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A quick question on compensation.\xc2\xa0 You phrased it that the bank executives acknowledged they have a problem with compensation.\xc2\xa0 How did the President understand that?\xc2\xa0 That these bank executives haven\'t come up with an effective way to pay their people, or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is it a public perception?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They understand that given what the taxpayers have done, the extraordinary steps that they\'ve taken, that compensation in that environment is out of step with any notion of common sense.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President has talked about before, and that\'s what the President reiterated -- again, not just in structure -- the President was clear and picked up on what another of the bankers said.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t -- it\'s not just about ensuring that there is -- that any compensation should be more directly tied to long-term equity versus short-term cash, but you have to make a strong evaluation about the sheer level and size of your compensation in the environment in which we exist.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the President believes that the bankers understand that it\'s beyond just a public perception they have -- they believe they have a problem with their compensation systems, right?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- again, I think there are those that are taking steps -- again, this is something that we\'ll be able to -- as they institute different types of reforms, we\'ll be able to evaluate whether they adopt say-on-pay.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s part of financial reform that\'s moving its way through Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 Again, whether they\'re tying much more of their compensation, again, to long-term equity that does invest immediately instead of to short-term cash.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is there any concern about a shift in leverage from Washington back to the banks now that so many of them are exiting the TARP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Leverage, how so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we couldn\'t get them to free up lending back when we were bailing them out with money.\xc2\xa0 How are we going to do that now that they\'re not so dependent on the TARP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- I think they are dependent upon -- they have been dependent upon the goodwill of the American people, and the President wanted to voice his concern and frustration with inability to match what the people and the public had done with what their actions are.\xc2\xa0 I think that the bully pulpit can be a powerful thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s it?\xc2\xa0 That\'s pretty much that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the next time the President jawbones you, you\'ll I guess get the same feeling that they have.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\'ll do it in quite the form he did it on "60 Minutes," but I think the President -- I think the American people understand that the President was clear.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Copenhagen, Robert?\xc2\xa0 Three days now from when the President is going to be flying out there.\xc2\xa0 By all accounts, most of the major issues are still outstanding.\xc2\xa0 There was a boycott today led by developing countries.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be something for him to sign when he gets there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President is committed to pursuing an accord that requires countries to take meaningful steps to address the climate change problem.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that there are still -- there will be issues left to resolve when he lands -- that developing nations are going to have to do their part; they\'re going to have to recognize the part that they have to do; that we have worked strongly and diplomatically to bring countries like India and China along to the point where it\'s possible to get some type of agreement; that the President will continue to work throughout this week to see -- to make sure that that happens.</p>\n<p>But there\'s no doubt there are issues that will remain outstanding for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he working -- you said he\'ll work this week.\xc2\xa0 Is he working the phones on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has made at least one call this morning and I think will wrap up some this afternoon, and we\'ll give you guys a readout.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get some of that later on today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on Copenhagen -- we\'d be interested in knowing who he\'s called -- but Prime Minister Gordon Brown apparently is flying in there two days early to try and take a more personal role in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Any thought given to that here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think when the President picks up the phone and calls world leaders, I would define that as personally involved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the President picked up the phone and called Joe Lieberman about health care reform?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he consider that?\xc2\xa0 Is the report true that\'s published on Politico that the White House is encouraging Senator Reid to sit down and make a deal with Lieberman and give up on the Medicare expansion?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can only say this, Ann:\xc2\xa0 The President is anxious to see progress and will continue to work with Democrats and Republicans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And independents.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and independents, and everyone in between to make that progress, to take those steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a serious problem with Senator Lieberman?\xc2\xa0 Would the President get involved?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ann, the President has been involved.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\'t be -- we wouldn\'t be sitting here, the 14th of December, when you\'d much rather be Christmas shopping, discussing the Senate being in on the weekends if the President wasn\'t involved.\xc2\xa0 The President has been involved the whole time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, merry Christmas, merry Christmas.\xc2\xa0 One -- just two.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Merry and Mara somewhat rhyme, so I\'m going to go with Mara real fast.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I have a quick question on health care and then one on banks.\xc2\xa0 What day did he record "60 Minutes"?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that would have been a week ago, so it would be last Monday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, Monday.\xc2\xa0 So on Monday, he was very -- or he expressed optimism that it would be passed by Christmas, health care.\xc2\xa0 This weekend we heard some crucial senators like Lieberman and Nelson saying that they couldn\'t vote for it, even this latest compromise.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, was that an expression of just general kind of failure-is-not-an-option optimism, or did he know something that we don\'t know --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look -- no, he hasn\'t changed his view.\xc2\xa0 And, look, we\'ve heard causes and concerns for months.\xc2\xa0 The President still believes the Senate is going to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe -- just to follow up on Ed, does he believe that Lieberman is negotiating in good faith or that he is just being a spoiler?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t asked him specifically about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know why the President would try to get into the head and speak for the motivations of somebody in any political party.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that it\'s incumbent upon all of those in the executive and the legislative branch to take the steps necessary to address the concerns of the American people.</p>\n<p>We know that they\'re struggling with the high costs and the rising costs of health insurance; that we have to do something about affordability and something about insurance reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President believes the Senate is involved in right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait -- to follow up Ed and Helene\'s question about what kind of leverage he has, you said the bully pulpit can be a powerful thing.\xc2\xa0 What results do you feel he\'s gotten so far with the use of the bully pulpit admonishing the banks?\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s used it quite a bit.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Financial reform through the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of lending, I mean.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if we thought all was good with lending we wouldn\'t have had the meeting today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President heard from bankers today.\xc2\xa0 They heard directly his concern about lending.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll evaluate going forward whether their acknowledgement that more can be done, that their acknowledgement that the President\'s meetings themselves have caused them to look more closely at their lending practices.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if they don\'t, what happens next?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ll evaluate that and ensure that steps are being taken in order to make sure that creditworthy businesses, small and medium-size, are getting access to the capital that they need to grow, to make their payrolls, and to see our economy through this dark night and into longer economic recovery.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:29 P.M.
