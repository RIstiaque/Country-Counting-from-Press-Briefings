Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:08 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Fiscal cliff:\xc2\xa0 At the start of the negotiations, the White House welcomed the Republican movement toward revenue.\xc2\xa0 You guys said that that was a good step in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, can you point to something that the President has done that kind of has moved in the direction of Republicans here?\xc2\xa0 The cuts that you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined have been ones that have been in your budget.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for almost double -- now you\xe2\x80\x99ve come down to $1.4 trillion -- it\xe2\x80\x99s almost double what the Republicans have put on the table.\xc2\xa0 And you have $200 billion in stimulus money there.\xc2\xa0 So what is it that -- can you point to us how that is a negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten some points for you.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear.\xc2\xa0 There is one party to these negotiations who has put forward a specific proposal for revenue and a specific proposal for spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Even when the Republicans -- and I saw Speaker Boehner do this earlier today -- insist that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t put forward spending cuts, it begs the question, what spending cuts have the Republicans put forward?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The proposal that we\'ve seen is a two-page letter, and the much-discussed second proposal is less than half a page.\xc2\xa0 There is no specificity behind what the Republicans have put forward, and no more than a sentence on revenues.</p>\n<p>The President has said when it comes to spending cuts, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I propose.\xc2\xa0 But he understands that it might require tougher choices and a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s made that clear and he\xe2\x80\x99s said repeatedly that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to do that.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen -- and you noted at the top -- is some rhetorical concession to the notion that revenue has to be part of the equation here, but not a single specified source of revenue; only the vague promise that revenue could be achieved through tax reform that somehow makes permanent the high-end tax cuts for the wealthy -- which is non-negotiable and is not happening -- and has a goal of lowering rates further -- i.e. giving another tax cut, an additional tax cut for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>This is fantasy economics.\xc2\xa0 And I know I\'m answering at length here, but in 1993 -- I know because I was there and I covered it -- John Boehner got up and said, if we pass the Clinton budget plan we\'ll lose jobs, the economy will shrink, inflation will go up.\xc2\xa0 Verbatim he said that, or close to verbatim; I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact quote, I had it on my computer.</p>\n<p>In 2001, he fiercely advocated for the massive tax cuts that President Bush insisted on, again in 2003, that went disproportionately to the wealthy, promising that they would lead to economic growth and a middle class that was better off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me just say that while I personally am very fond of John Boehner, his record of predicting what would happen if certain policies, economic policies were instituted is abysmal, okay?\xc2\xa0 Because after 1993, after that budget plan was passed, we saw record economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We saw record job creation.\xc2\xa0 We saw the middle class strengthened and made more secure, and we saw vast amounts of wealth created in this country.</p>\n<p>In the aftermath of those two massive tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that President Bush authored and then-Congressman Boehner advocated, we saw stagnation for the middle class; we saw anemic economic growth, and then the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes -- not to mention surpluses turned into deficits.</p>\n<p>So the President has a plan.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very specific.\xc2\xa0 He understands that he will not get everything in his plan.\xc2\xa0 He is prepared to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 But it is not a tenable position to say that the tax cuts for the wealthy should be made permanent.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The President has made that clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question was where has the President moved toward the Republicans --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as it\'s been reported -- of course, not by us, but has been described by those who have received it -- the President has moved in his proposal for revenue and he has put forward very specific spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Again, what we lack on either spending or revenue from the Republicans is a single specific -- occasionally I see in reports Republicans saying, well, we have our budget, too.\xc2\xa0 Okay, if Republicans are saying that their spending cuts include turning Medicare into a voucher, I think they ought to say so.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people would be very interested to hear that, since we just had an election where that was a focus and it was roundly opposed by a majority of the American people.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s their position.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, is while they insist on greater spending cuts -- and we\'re willing to have that conversation about additional spending cuts -- we need to know what it is they\'re proposing.\xc2\xa0 And they have yet to tell you that, and they have yet to tell us that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker also said that the debt ceiling demands just would never pass Congress.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\'s negotiable to you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\'s what the President is proposing.\xc2\xa0 He\'s proposing that the legislation authored by Senator McConnell -- not a noted Obama sympathizer -- be taken up again and adopted.\xc2\xa0 And I noted that Speaker Boehner made the point that then-Senator Obama and Senator Reid at the time would not have supported such a move under President George W. Bush.\xc2\xa0 But here\'s what I have to say about that.\xc2\xa0 What happened last year, when House Republicans, led by Speaker Boehner, brought this country to the brink of default had never happened before.\xc2\xa0 Congress, prior to that, while raising the debt ceiling had been a matter of debate, had always done its job, had never in the history of this country threatened default on our credit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And because we can\'t do that again, because we cannot do what some Republicans seem to think is wise economic policy, which is engage in that folly every three or six months, the President suggested that we adopt Senator McConnell\'s proposal, which has been in place since the summer of 2011.\xc2\xa0 And that is all.\xc2\xa0 And that proposal, by the way, still gives Congress the authority to vote on, and if they disagree with the President\'s decision, to override a veto of a rejection of raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So the authority still resides there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we cannot play this game, because while it might be satisfying to those with highly partisan and ideological agendas, it\'s not satisfying to the American people and is punishing to the American economy.\xc2\xa0 We cannot do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like this demand -- you would not let that demand hold up a deal if there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\'s what I\'ll say about that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes Congress ought to do its job.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s remember what a vote to raise the debt ceiling is.\xc2\xa0 It is a vote to pay the bills that Congress has incurred.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t control the purse strings -- the President of either party.\xc2\xa0 Congress passes bills that appropriate money.\xc2\xa0 Congress says, we\'re building this bridge or funding that defense project, and they cost this much. And because it is the United States, those bills have always been paid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So when Congress raises the debt ceiling, this is not about spending in the future; it\'s about paying bills that Congress has incurred.\xc2\xa0 So it would be the height of irresponsibility for Congress not to do its job and not to pay the bills that it racked up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will not engage in that kind of brinksmanship.\xc2\xa0 He just expects Congress to do its job.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration given a written offer to the Speaker?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 Although since so much of this seems to leak from elsewhere, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s known that we have exchanged offers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but you keep deriding their offer as nonspecific because it\xe2\x80\x99s just a short letter.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the Geithner offer was verbal.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even written down, so if writing is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics, but everything that\'s behind --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the measure of seriousness, your offer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even written.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jessica, everything that -- every conversation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Congress both at the level of Secretary Geithner and Rob Nabors and at the level of the President has been backed by the specific proposals that we have on paper.\xc2\xa0 So when we say $1.6 trillion in revenue, it\xe2\x80\x99s documented.\xc2\xa0 When we say, $600 billion in spending cuts, it\xe2\x80\x99s documented that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you dispute that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t understand what you\'re saying.\xc2\xa0 So we have the documentation; they have the documentation.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, verbally, if he repeats everything in an 80-page proposal -- no.\xc2\xa0 But they know where our proposed cuts from come, and they know where our proposed revenue comes from.\xc2\xa0 And when we reduce our revenue proposal --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was in the original proposal, you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, from this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- when Geithner went up to the Hill, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t present it --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that is our proposal.\xc2\xa0 They know what our\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he was reiterating a past proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 We have put forward specific cuts.\xc2\xa0 And let me remind you that even the House Republican budget, which is sometimes cited as the source for their cuts, is wholly unspecific.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just targets.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just across-the-board stuff.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no specificity beyond the voucherization of Medicare for how they would achieve cuts.\xc2\xa0 So again, the only party to these negotiations who has put forward any specific cuts or any specificity when it comes to raising revenues is the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And here\xe2\x80\x99s how we know that -- because if you were to ask the leaders in Congress on the Republican side, what are their specifics, they will not tell you, and they have not told us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House dispute the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s contention that negotiations are at the 11th hour now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if we are 11/12\xe2\x80\x99s of the way through the year -- we are, we\xe2\x80\x99re even beyond that.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair assessment that we are close to a deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the President feel it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on him to make a new offer now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that he should negotiate with himself.\xc2\xa0 He has made abundantly clear that Republicans need to accept the fact that rates will go up on the top 2 percent and that we should extend tax cuts for the remaining 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 Thus far, we have not seen an acceptance of that by Republican leaders, and in fact, the proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and that you guys have reported on doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just reject that, it says we should make permanent the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner has said he is leaving town tomorrow and he won\xe2\x80\x99t be here this weekend.\xc2\xa0 Does the President read this as a sign that negotiations have been unsuccessful, that he\xe2\x80\x99s been unable to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached an agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also true that the parameters of an agreement are very clear, and how we -- the building blocks --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that worrisome?\xc2\xa0 You guys need to be making --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worrisome for the American people that thus far the House Republican leadership has refused to accept the fundamental principle that was debated again and again and again throughout a presidential election and on which the American people made their voices heard and their opinions clear.\xc2\xa0 It is a position the President has been utterly transparent about and a position that some pundits thought was politically risky but that he believed was absolutely the right position to take for our economy.</p>\n<p>So there is no particular reason why we can\xe2\x80\x99t get this done very quickly beyond the single obstacle here, which is that the Republicans refuse to accept that rates are going up on the high end -- the top earners in this country.\xc2\xa0 And again, if the Republicans have specific spending cuts that they would like to propose that build on or are different from the ones the President has proposed, I think they should.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to negotiating that, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, on a different topic.\xc2\xa0 As senator, President Obama repeatedly traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan with then-Senator Chuck Hagel.\xc2\xa0 He has said flattering things about him and appointed him to this Intelligence Advisory Board.\xc2\xa0 He obviously thinks very highly of him.\xc2\xa0 But what would the President say to pro-Israel advocates who are concerned or have voiced strong concerns about his position on sanctions, Iran and Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, I can tell, to engage in conversation about potential personnel decisions the President is making and will make.\xc2\xa0 And I have no opinions to offer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we know Mr. Hagel has met with the President and Vice President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President thinks very highly of Senator Hagel.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people in Washington and around the country, and especially in Senator Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s home state think very highly of him.\xc2\xa0 But I have no news to make for you on that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the offer that Speaker Boehner made on Tuesday different from the offer that he had made previously?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you for specifics.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is a specific difference.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that we have yet to see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say that the President is not going to negotiate with himself --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I will tell --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- which suggests that Speaker Boehner wasn\xe2\x80\x99t offering something different.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I will say, is that on the fundamental obstacle, the answer is, no, we have not seen in any of our conversations or offers any difference in the stated position by the Speaker of the House when it comes to revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the irony of even the proposal that was in the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s letter and that has been put forward as the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0 -- the Republican position, they called it -- that promises $800 billion in revenue, which is not enough to create the balanced plan that\'s necessary for our broad-based deficit reduction goals.\xc2\xa0 But even that $800 billion has been totally unspecified beyond their insistence that lower tax rates be extended for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s where it stands.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe the $800 billion is part of the $1.2 trillion that the President said would be in tax deductions and limited closing loopholes last year.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we see no specificity.\xc2\xa0 And what Jason Furman got up here and described to you in great detail, using solid facts and analysis by independent economists, not reports commissioned by industry in support of a political agenda, makes it very clear that we cannot achieve the kind of revenue necessary simply through cutting deductions, or capping deductions and closing loopholes limited to the wealthy, or to those making more than $250,000 in any economically sensible or politically feasible way.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So again, you can write that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other contentious issues, including the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and House Republicans think that the degree to which spending will be reduced or cut is a big, contentious issue.\xc2\xa0 Did the Speaker\'s second proposal not -- was it not different a little bit at least from his first proposal when it came to spending cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have not seen any specificity when it comes to spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 We know that Republicans want greater spending cuts, but we don\'t know how they would achieve them, what their proposals are.\xc2\xa0 If the answer -- which we haven\'t heard -- but if the answer is, well, go look at the Ryan budget, we know that, A, that lacks specificity, too, always did -- and, B, that it contains the voucherization of Medicare, which is not happening.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that doesn\'t mean that there are not serious and credible ways to further reduce spending that this President would entertain and be able to come to an agreement on with Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We believe there are.\xc2\xa0 And this President has made clear that he understands that it\'s -- that this is not easy, that he will not get everything that he wants, that his plan as written will not be what\'s passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 And he is willing to make tough choices.</p>\n<p>But there are some clear red lines when it comes to how we build a broader deficit reduction package.\xc2\xa0 And one red line is he will not sign into law an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t afford it and it\'s bad economic policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any sort of plan B being discussed, whether with the Speaker or on some sort of separate track, so that if there isn\'t a deal cut, there is at least some way to pass the 98 percent -- extending the tax cuts for 98 percent and paying down some of the sequestered spending cuts at least for a few months until something can be worked out?\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort being made by Mr. Nabors or anybody in the White House to at least have that ready so we don\'t entirely go over the cliff on January 1st?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 We still believe that a big deal is possible.\xc2\xa0 We believe the parameters are there and we remain confident that if Republicans agree with the basic idea that rates have to go up for the wealthiest while we extend tax cuts for everyone else that we can reach a deal fairly quickly.</p>\n<p>Yes, I mean, one aspect of a way to deal with this at the very least would be to pass the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people.\xc2\xa0 That would deal with a chunk of the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 And I am sure that there are others who have -- as part of putting together a bigger proposal, but also independent from that, I\'m sure there are ways to address issues of the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that this is an opportune time to think bigger than that, to do more than that, to try to pass a broad package that, combined with the spending cuts already signed into law, achieves the kind of significant deficit reduction that puts us on a fiscally sustainable path for a decade.\xc2\xa0 And he doesn\'t want to pass up that opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Got it.\xc2\xa0 But just in case --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not saying that there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in case of emergency, break glass.\xc2\xa0 Is there some sort of plan B?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In case of emergency, the House should break the glass; the House Speaker ought to allow the Republicans to vote on extending tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people. That would deal with a chunk of the so-called fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 \\</p>\n<p>And I will refrain from reading the quotations from congressman after congressman of the Republican Party, as well as senators who have said that we should do that at the very least. And I\'m hoping that, and the President hopes that those voices are heard and that action is taken, because the dysfunction that appears to continue to exist in Washington should not result in punishment for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s unfair and it\'s bad for our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 The President went to Michigan and he waded into the local controversy there involving right to work.\xc2\xa0 There was violence at some of the demonstrations, with the union activists being involved.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President was aware of any of this violence, if he had any response to it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t discussed reports like that with him, so I\'m not sure he\'s aware of it.\xc2\xa0 But we deplore violence in any case.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels very strongly, as he said on his visit to Michigan the other day, that right-to-work laws are really right-to-be-paid-less laws, and that they reflect a political agenda and not an economic agenda, and he opposes them. We should not make it harder for workers to organize, and that\'s his position.\xc2\xa0 But certainly, we do not support violence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s been no negotiation back and forth --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There\'s been no negotiations back and forth as far as anybody can tell, in the sense that terms have been discussed, debated, swapped back and forth, and won\'t be, if I hear you correctly, unless and until Republicans agree in advance that they will drop their opposition to the tax hike on the upper 2 percent.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess it\'s a question of semantics in terms of what negotiations mean.\xc2\xa0 But we have obviously had meetings and we\'ve had discussions and we\'ve had phone calls, and we\'ve presented ideas and ideas have been presented to us.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- on the issue of -- on the revenue side, I think the President could not have been more clear, and I will reiterate the clarity, which is he will not sign --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So nothing happens until they agree -- is that what you\'re saying?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because we\'ve put forward spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 And if --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, but you put them forward a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 They were written into a budget and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and they achieve a significant amount of savings.\xc2\xa0 And if the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other side says they don\'t, they\xe2\x80\x99re never going to pass on that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do they?\xc2\xa0 Because the math doesn\'t back up their words, which is frequently the case.\xc2\xa0 They do achieve significant savings.\xc2\xa0 And what distinguishes them from spending cut proposals by the Republicans is they exist and they\'re in detail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what the President believes is that there is an opportunity for a deal here, for a compromise here, one that achieves security for the middle class, certainty for the middle class by extending those tax cuts for the middle class, and one that deals with the fiscal cliff and one that broadly puts us on a sustainable fiscal path.\xc2\xa0 That opportunity exists.</p>\n<p>But here\'s the thing.\xc2\xa0 You have reported -- I don\'t know if you personally, but many of you in this room have reported on the offer we made earlier this week, which actually does reduce the amount of revenue that the President believes should be part of this package.\xc2\xa0 Again, but we\'re not going to just negotiate with ourselves.\xc2\xa0 What we have not seen is any specificity from the Republicans or any indication from the leadership that they\'re going to accept the basic principle that wealthier Americans are going to pay higher rates, rates that were in place under the Clinton administration when this economy grew rapidly, the middle class saw its incomes rise and the wealthy did very well, to boot.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re saying that no negotiation can really begin until they accept your first principle --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what I\'m saying, Bill.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what you\'re saying.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and if the Speaker is saying no negotiation really can begin --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Negotiation is taking place and we\'ve put forward offers.\xc2\xa0 And what we have not seen from the Republicans is any movement at all on the fundamental issue here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, tax reform is a big piece of this.\xc2\xa0 You were outspoken in the last campaign about saying Mitt Romney\'s use of offshore accounts while legal was not fair.\xc2\xa0 Do you share the same concern, level of concern about Google and Eric Schmidt, who has been an advisor to the President, informal advisor, using accounts in Bermuda to not pay their fair share of taxes?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even aware of that story, so I don\'t have an opinion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were several reports in that last couple of days.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been focused on the fiscal cliff, on Syria, on North Korea -- so I\'m not aware of those stories.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats have talked up the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, because it pretty much hit the election in the weeks and months leading up to it in terms of how it was going to turn out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what\'s the Republican view?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\'t like that poll as much.\xc2\xa0 They had a poll last night that said if we go off the fiscal cliff and we can\'t get a compromise, who\'s to blame?\xc2\xa0 Nineteen percent said the President and Democrats, 24 percent said Republicans, and 56 percent say they\'d be equally at blame.\xc2\xa0 How does that square with you saying in recent weeks that if we go off the cliff, this is all the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 fault?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what the people seem to be saying.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t said that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said -- you\'ve never heard me say if we go off the cliff, the American people will blame one side or the other.\xc2\xa0 What I have said is the American people support the President\'s position overwhelmingly. And that was demonstrated in exit polls from the election.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been demonstrated in polls ever since.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just a fact, and it was an uncomfortable fact.\xc2\xa0 But the proposition that middle-class Americans should have their taxes go up on average of $2,000 if wealthy Americans don\'t get a tax cut I think is bad politics as well as bad policy.\xc2\xa0 And the American people have responded that way.</p>\n<p>The fact that Americans do not like to see dysfunction in Washington is not a new fact and it certainly is not surprising. But we are trying very hard to reach a broad agreement that achieves not just a mitigation of the fiscal cliff and avoids that coming to pass, but more broadly, actually achieves deficit reduction, a goal which supposedly the Republican Party shares, even though when they were in control last time we saw record deficits, and deficits went down under President Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s a little history lesson that needs to be learned here.</p>\n<p>But the fact is this President is committed to sensible deficit reduction that helps our economy grow and that insulates the middle class from bearing the burden that, unfortunately thus far, Republican proposals -- Republicans would like to see them bear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a last question, you\'re saying the President is committed to getting this done.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Bill, in terms of negotiations -- and the public is saying, this poll, 56 percent think the parties would be equally to blame -- why not -- with Jessica saying Speaker Boehner is leaving town, why isn\'t the President bringing the leaders over here and just saying -- as you\'ve said over and over --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner was here --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier in this process you dismissed that idea, but now it\'s late --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner was here a few days ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and you just said the parameters of the debate are obvious -- okay, you said parameters are obvious here.\xc2\xa0 So why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President bring the Speaker in here and just get this thing done?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that if -- first of all, the Speaker of the House was here.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken to the Speaker of the House recently.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker physically was here Sunday; the President has spoken with the Speaker since then.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s now Thursday and we\'re getting closer.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Every time that you guys seem to think that a physical meeting is the elixir to all our ills, I think it would behoove you to ask the Speaker if he believes that, or ask the House Majority Leader if he believes that.</p>\n<p>We have put forward proposals.\xc2\xa0 We have received proposals. The process continues.\xc2\xa0 There are clear obstacles here, the principle one being the rather amazing insistence -- given the road we\'ve traveled these past several years, given the degree to which this was debated, the degree to which independent economists back up the President\'s position -- we still have this insistence that we\'re not going to do anything that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include tax cuts for the wealthy from the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s just not acceptable to the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just interject -- the Speaker\'s office says there is cell phone coverage in Ohio, and if the President wants to talk they can.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And there\'s actually hard lines here, and I think the Speaker knows that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will he be talking to him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any phone calls or conversations to preview for you.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the issue of the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 You compare it to the McConnell plan.\xc2\xa0 Republicans push back against that.\xc2\xa0 They say the McConnell plan was never meant to be permanent and it also came with a guaranteed amount of spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 They say the President\'s plan does not come with that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the McConnell plan was separate from the spending cuts that were part of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the concern is -- and House Speaker John Boehner said today that the debt ceiling brings fiscal sanity to Washington.\xc2\xa0 Why is that not true?\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have to get --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you ought to ask the Speaker if in the 1990s when Bill Clinton was President and Washington was able to erase deficits for the first time in decades and create surpluses for the first time in decades -- Speaker Boehner was here, he should remember -- did Congress then flirt with default when the debt ceiling was raised?\xc2\xa0 The answer is no.\xc2\xa0 Did Congress under President George W. Bush flirt with default and cause the markets alarm and our economy to slow down and job creation to slow down because one party or the other had demands that insisted on being met?\xc2\xa0 The answer is no.</p>\n<p>That has happened once, and it happened last year, and Speaker Boehner was Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President believes we need to take -- I understand that it was a -- the McConnell plan was passed once, and we believe we ought to take it up again and pass it again, because the American economy cannot afford the consequences of that kind of political gamesmanship.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just -- it is unconscionable to imagine that because Congress insists it be so that the entire economy could default and that for the first time in our history we would not pay our bills.</p>\n<p>Because remember as I said before, the debt ceiling is -- raising the debt ceiling merely gives Congress the capacity to pay for the work they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it gives them the power to borrow more.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To pay for the work that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to borrow more money.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And raise the debt.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so the alternative, which is default, is to not pay for the bills that Congress has incurred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m not disputing that it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult process.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the best way to keep deficits in check?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I could go over the history again.\xc2\xa0 In our lifetimes, certainly yours, the last time and the only time that deficits have turned into surpluses -- I just mean that I\xe2\x80\x99m a lot older.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But my lifetime, too.\xc2\xa0 You are still the fountain of youth by comparison to me.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure in my -- in fact, I know in my lifetime as well, the only time there have not been deficits, the only time that the budget has been balanced, the only time that we have been creating surpluses was under President Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And we did not have this kind of gamesmanship.\xc2\xa0 We did not have members of Congress threatening to default.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the wrong thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s damaging to the economy. It\xe2\x80\x99s punishing to the middle class.</p>\n<p>And if the position is that the middle class ought to have its taxes go up and then get stuck again because of a refusal of Congress to do its job, that\'s just absolutely unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask one on Syria.\xc2\xa0 Jay, based on your comments yesterday, it appears as though there are no plans to interfere militarily in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But does the President worry that this sends a message to Assad that he can use Scud missiles and other types of weapons against his own people without the fear of international --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 We have explicitly condemned the use of missiles.\xc2\xa0 It is just another demonstration of the utter depravity of the Assad regime and the lengths to which he will go to retain power.\xc2\xa0 The assault on his own people has been heinous.\xc2\xa0 It has been proof that he\xe2\x80\x99s a tyrant and proof that he has no place in Syria\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 And we have joined our international partners in condemning it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have joined our international partners in providing a variety of forms of aid to both the Syrian people and the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 I believe we have made announcements of additional aid that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to take that path because Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot include the kind of leader who would launch missiles against his own people, slaughter them in the way that he has, repeatedly, over the past year or so.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the escalation, is he in any way considering his red line in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our policy remains what it was, and we obviously consult with our allies and others and evaluate the situation regularly.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that providing continued support to the Syrian people as well as non-lethal support to the opposition is the right approach.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very engaged in assisting the opposition unify itself.\xc2\xa0 We recognized the Syrian Opposition Coalition just this week as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with our partners to isolate Assad and to help bring about the day when the Syrian people can decide for themselves on a better future for their country.</p>\n<p>Jon Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fiscal cliff:\xc2\xa0 We are way beyond the early stage, and the international markets are very concerned.\xc2\xa0 Instability is something that they deplore.\xc2\xa0 Is there one more thing you can say to calm or quell the fears that international finance has --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the parameters of an agreement are clear.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not complicated.\xc2\xa0 And we hope and look forward to the time when Republicans acknowledge that revenues not only have to be part of the equation, but that rates on top earners have to go up as part of the revenue equation.\xc2\xa0 And when that happens, we believe that we can reach a deal fairly quickly, because the President has made clear that as part of a balanced package, spending cuts need to be part of this and that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work with Republicans and make tough choices to achieve the kind of balanced package that he seeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Durbin said that the President is no longer open to raising the Medicare eligibility age.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those remarks, but I can tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate specifics of the -- I\'m not doubting them, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying -- I speak for the President, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details of hypothetical --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s someone from your own party from the President\xe2\x80\x99s home state.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the answer for the President, which is that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to engage in hypotheticals about what a package would like on the spending cut side and negotiate it with the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 What we will not accept, I think has been clear, is the promise of future revenues achieved miraculously through means that are so amazing they won\xe2\x80\x99t even be put on paper, that allow for extension of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and that end up sticking it to the middle class and seniors.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a package the President will accept.\xc2\xa0 He is willing to make hard choices, however, but he will make hard choices that make sense for the economy and for our seniors and our middle class and our students and families with disabled children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would Senator Durbin say that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t speak for Senator Durbin.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said there are clear red lines on revenue, no tax cuts for the top 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 Are there clear red lines on entitlements other than keeping Social Security on a separate track and not using that as part of the deficit reduction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad range of crazy ideas I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that I could rule out.\xc2\xa0 But the President is committed to making sensible choices in terms of deficit reduction that ensure the integrity and sustainability of our very important entitlement programs for seniors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But is voucherization of Medicare not something the President would accept?\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s fair to say.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s the only red line you draw --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s not what I said, Mara.\xc2\xa0 Go back to the beginning of my answer.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are all sorts of bad ideas that could be thrown out there that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass muster and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the details of a sensible compromise from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, even though Senator Durbin said what he said, to Barbara Walters, the President did not rule out raising the Medicare retirement age.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the President is not going to rule in or rule out things in interviews.\xc2\xa0 He has been trying to have these conversations and negotiations in a constructive way.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen from Republicans is any specificity about how they would achieve the kind of spending reductions, the levels of spending reductions that they claim to seek.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to the time when we can see some specifics from them.\xc2\xa0 So I think he like I is not eager to negotiate the specifics of a potential compromise with the media.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told his members today to be prepared to stay here through the weekend before Christmas, into the holidays if a deal isn\xe2\x80\x99t reached.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s vacation plans and any contingencies at the White House as these negotiations kind of build into the holiday season?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is what it is.\xc2\xa0 And when we have -- if we have adjustments to that schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make you aware of them.</p>\n<p>But right now the President is focused on what he believes is an achievable compromise that would not take very long to put together if we saw some specificity and some flexibility from Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you prepared for this to go into the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s required.\xc2\xa0 But again, what we hope to see is some acknowledgement by Republican leaders that existing law when it comes to the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans should stay in place.\xc2\xa0 Those tax rates that provide generous tax cuts to the top 2 percent should not be extending.\xc2\xa0 The President will not sign an extension of those rates.</p>\n<p>The rest of the country, 98 percent of us, should see tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Everyone in Washington agrees on those tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The President is eager to sign those tax cuts, and he hopes that Republicans in the House will follow the lead of the Senate and pass those tax cuts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that question, when does this get to the point where there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough time to get legislation through Congress and to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk to sign it?\xc2\xa0 Where\xc2\xa0 -- given that the end of the year is the deadline, when in December are there not enough days left?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that that\'s a question that you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask leaders in Congress because they decide the calendar.\xc2\xa0 They have an even deeper understanding of the rules than I do, so I would refer you to them.</p>\n<p>Yes, Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Russia has said for the first time that it looks like the rebels might win.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see any sign in this that Russia is disengaging from Assad?\xc2\xa0 And if so, would it represent an opening for the frustrated efforts to get rid of him diplomatically?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw those remarks.\xc2\xa0 I would say that we certainly agree that Assad will not be a part of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future. We have noted as the media has the progress that the opposition has been making.\xc2\xa0 We still believe that for the sake of the Syrian people Assad ought to leave now.\xc2\xa0 He ought to remove himself from power now, because it is terrible what damage he has inflicted on the Syrian people, the lives that have been lost because of his brutality.\xc2\xa0 But we welcome all progress in the effort to bring an understanding of the fact that Assad has to go, that he has no place in Syria\'s history -- I mean, in Syria\'s future.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately he does have a place in Syria\'s history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I have no other assessment to make of those remarks, which I just saw before I came out here.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, quick question.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be talking to media this afternoon, local media.\xc2\xa0 He\'s been traveling, trying to apply pressure from the outside in, talking to the business community.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any examples of where the President believes that that -- working from the outside in is getting closer -- getting everyone closer to a negotiating deal before the end of the year?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can certainly tell you that in the effort to extend the payroll tax cut last year and in the effort to ensure that rates on student loans didn\xe2\x80\x99t double, the President\'s approach was both to work directly with leaders of Congress and to bring his position to the American people out in the country, and that that strategy, we believe, proved effective.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s entirely sensible, because these are debates that are not about obscure subjects that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to pay attention to; these are debates that affect every American\xe2\x80\x99s life.</p>\n<p>And so he looks forward to every opportunity to communicate with the American people where they live and where they get their information.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s often -- in the latter example, that\xe2\x80\x99s often from local television, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\'s doing interviews today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it showing -- are there examples of where you can see the ground shifting now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I cannot say that a Republican congressman who now believes we ought to extend tax cuts for the middle class and accepts that we will not extend tax cuts for the top 2 percent came to that position after he or she saw a local news report.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the broader effect of the campaign and the debate that we had over this past year that focused on these issues, and the President\'s continued efforts to explain to the American people what his views are and why he\'s taking the positions that he\'s taking and what he believes the stakes are has had an effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The purpose being that we believe there ought to be a compromise where nobody gets everything that he wants, but that we all come together to agree to a package that achieves something that would be very beneficial to this country\'s economy, which a long-term deficit reduction deal that protects the middle class, that helps the economy grow and create jobs, that ensures that we continue to invest in areas that will help the economy grow long term and that brings down our deficits in a way that puts us on a fiscally sustainable path -- that\'s a goal that I believe, the President believes, many share here in Washington, both Democrats and Republicans, and he looks forward to the opportunity to achieve it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a follow-up to what you said to Kristen really.\xc2\xa0 I, too, am old enough to remember the mid-\'90s.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m old enough to remember --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen remembers that.\xc2\xa0 I just mean that -- I just want to be clear that the only time in her lifetime there\'s been a surplus was under Bill Clinton.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But before, in \'95 and \'96, I remember, before the budgets were balanced, we had two major government shutdowns.\xc2\xa0 And it became very personal, the negotiations became very personal.\xc2\xa0 Don\'t we run the risk of this becoming a personal kind of thing with this crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure about that assessment.\xc2\xa0 I think that President Clinton and then-Speaker Gingrich continued to talk and negotiate, even though they came at it from different points of view.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that\'s very different from the situation we have now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the personal level, I think and I know that the President likes and respects Speaker Boehner and has good relations with congressional leaders of both parties, as well as rank-and-file members in both parties.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 But the most important thing is that we here in Washington respond to and listen to the American people, and we make the tough choices that we believe are right for the economy and for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s why he hopes that Republicans in the House will pass tax cuts for the middle class; why he hopes Republican leaders will agree to the basic principle that in order to achieve the kind of deficit reduction that\'s necessary and balanced, we need rates to go up on top earners.\xc2\xa0 And then, we can move forward with a package that includes tough spending cuts, but spending cuts that are sensible and make sure that we achieve the balance the President believes is both the right way to go and that the American people want to see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'re not slamming the phone down on each other or anything?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have never seen that happen on this end.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 A few years ago, Defense Secretary Gates said that North Korea\'s attempt to develop an ICBM program could in a number of years pose a direct threat to the American homeland.\xc2\xa0 The North Koreans have now successfully put a long-range missile into orbit.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering whether you believe, the President believes, that the American people should feel directly threatened by what the North Koreans did this week.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, the second is, the Chinese, as they often do in a case like this, have been extremely muted in their response, I think expressing regret but little more about what happened.\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated?\xc2\xa0 And would he like the Chinese to take a tougher line with Pyongyang?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the second question, I think you\'ve seen us be very explicit about our desire to have China exert the influence that it has on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 I think that the Chinese, in our view, have made clear both prior to this launch and in the aftermath of the launch their opposition to it.\xc2\xa0 And that, we believe, is a positive thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the broader issue, there is no question that North Korea\'s flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions that apply to its nuclear program and to its ballistic missile program matters of serious concern.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be the case.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have spoken out so clearly against this action and why we are working with our partners up in New York at the United Nations on the Security Council discussing next steps.</p>\n<p>There will be consequences for this decision.\xc2\xa0 And that is because we are, rightly, concerned, with our international partners, about this development.\xc2\xa0 But let\'s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Under this President we have marshaled an international consensus about North Korean behavior and applied the kind of sanctions that have further isolated and brought pain to the North Korean leadership, which is entirely appropriate.\xc2\xa0 But it is a matter of concern.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, I guess what I\'m asking is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But in terms of what Secretary Gates said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for you, but we certainly believe, as demonstrated by what we\'ve said in reaction to it, that this kind of violation of North Korea\'s international obligations is a serious matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess -- just one more shot at this.\xc2\xa0 The issue up until now has been primarily regional; it\'s a threat to the South Koreans, it\'s a threat to the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 But no one has really thought that these missiles were technologically capable of reaching the American homeland.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the view?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s certainly still the view that is the case, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeline for you and I would simply refer back to Secretary Gates\'s comments.\xc2\xa0 But I would also note that one of the reasons why this President has pursued missile defense that is oriented towards threats that we perceive as real is so important.\xc2\xa0 And that includes, obviously, North Korea as well as Iran.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re pursuing this issue from a variety of fronts because we consider it to be very serious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How would you compare the situation with North Korea and with Iran?\xc2\xa0 Are they on the same -- is it the same dynamics that you seek a Security Council resolution that there will be timelines, there will be red lines?\xc2\xa0 Or is North Korea a different case than Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they are certainly at different stages in the developments of their prohibitive programs, and there are different countries -- there are in some ways different issues at stake.\xc2\xa0 But the overall principle that Iran ought to forsake its nuclear weapons program, abide by its international obligations and thereby end its pariah status, re-enter the international community and enjoy the benefits thereof applies to North Korea. And North Korea ought to cease violation of its international obligations and take the necessary steps to assure the international community of that cessation, and that that would be better for North Korea and better for the North Koreans.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:58 P.M.
