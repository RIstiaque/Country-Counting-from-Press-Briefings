<h1>Press Briefing by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, 6/3/2010</h1>
b'<div class="field field-name-field-forall-body field-type-text-long field-label-hidden forall-body">\n<div class="field-items">\n<div class="field-item even"><p>* The amount of the bill sent to BP today is $69 million, which accounts for 75% of the obligations to date.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actual expenditures will likely vary <br/>\nfrom these projections but future invoices will recoup the full costs based on actual expenses incurred.\xc2\xa0 BP was given until July 1 to pay the full $69 million.\xc2\xa0 Costs included in the $69 million are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$29 million - For Federal agencies to support operation of ships, aircraft and boats, to support environmental assessment/monitoring, to support deployed personnel, and other expenses.</li>\n<li>$4 million - For Department of Defense support of salvage and removal efforts, to support operation of ships and aircraft.</li>\n<li>$29 million - For National Guard Bureau to support activation and deployment of National Guard from LA, MS, AL and FL, to support deployed personnel, and other expenses.</li>\n<li>$7 million - For states to support removal operations, to support environmental assessment/monitoring, and other expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>\n**Let me clarify, what I mean is President Calderon\xe2\x80\x99s courageous efforts to go after the cartels have put them on the defensive and they are reacting violently.\xc2\xa0 As was highlighted during the State Visit, we are committed to working with Mexico to go after the cartels that pose a threat to communities on both sides of the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>2:27 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just one quick scheduling update for you all.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow before departing for the Gulf, the President will stop with the Vice President at a business in Hyattsville, Maryland, to comment on the May employment numbers that will be, as you know, released tomorrow.</p>\n<p>They will visit the K Neal International commercial truck dealership and parts -- truck parts supplier.\xc2\xa0 The President and Vice President will do a tour with workers, and the President will make brief remarks to pooled press.</p>\n<p>Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have a few questions about the Romanoff matter, following up on your e-mail this morning.\xc2\xa0 Did the President sign off on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s approaching Romanoff about the prospect of jobs to get into --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t aware?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is his reaction to this?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We now have two confirmed cases of the White House actively seeking to encourage Democratic candidates to bow out of primary challenges.\xc2\xa0 How can you contend that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t politics as usual?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, I think the leaders of parties have long had an interest in ensuring that supporters didn\xe2\x80\x99t run against each other in contested primaries.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what was done in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the White House has been transparent about this?\xc2\xa0 It seems like the details of this, if in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate, have rolled out later only upon --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If in fact what is legitimate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That the -- has the White House been transparent about these offers; if in fact nothing was done wrong, why has it taken so long for all this to come out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you all have received quite a bit of information over the past week on this, and I do believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve been transparent, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You do?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, overall, does the President stand by these?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stand by?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stand by these offers to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has, as the leader of the party, has an interest in ensuring that supporters don\xe2\x80\x99t run against each other in contested primaries, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that makes it sounds like he did know about them, then.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he\xe2\x80\x99s not aware of the individual circumstances.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we went through a pretty contested primary.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not altogether fun things.\xc2\xa0 Again, does the leader of the party have an interest in ensuring that primaries that tend to be costly aren\xe2\x80\x99t had so that you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for a general election?\xc2\xa0 Of course.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what the President hopes to accomplish on tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s trip?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk a little bit about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing down there?\xc2\xa0 And what does he hope to accomplish that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do on the last two trips?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some scheduling details for you all shortly.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will likely see governors again.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will speak with individuals and business leaders likely that have been affected directly by the economic consequences of the spill, and continue to get from Admiral Allen a firsthand update on our progress, both in dealing with the well and in dealing with the spread of pollution that has leaked from the well.</p>\n<p>I think the President believed that last week\xe2\x80\x99s trip was tremendously productive.\xc2\xa0 We had about a two-hour meeting with parish presidents from Louisiana affected by the spill, senators and a congressman from Louisiana, governors from many of the Gulf states, and I think -- along with the Coast Guard -- and I think the President believed it was a productive atmosphere in ensuring that everybody\xe2\x80\x99s causes and concerns were heard and ultimately met.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the criticism that the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t making that emotional connection with people over the spill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I -- this one is -- I said this last night -- if jumping up and down and screaming were to fix a hole in the ocean, we\xe2\x80\x99d have done that five or six weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d have done that the first night.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be judged and the President will be judged on our response and our recovery efforts to what we all know now is the worst environmental disaster in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 But pounding on a podium isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to fix a hole in the ocean.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think what the American people and the citizens of the Gulf are expecting are results.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will be measured by.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave emotional psychiatry to others.</p>\n<p>Hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask a quick question about the -- you mentioned the May jobs report and I was wondering where things stand with the effort to get that jobs bill through.\xc2\xa0 Some Democrats are worried about the budgetary implications of that.\xc2\xa0 And tying it into the Gulf, are you concerned that his political capital is a little weakened from this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with a lot of criticism over this right now and that\xe2\x80\x99s taking a lot of time, a lot of White House time, maybe --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- possibly a distraction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I said this earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 I think you -- no White House at any time has the luxury of picking the events that it deals with, both on a domestic and an international -- and on the international scene.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job.</p>\n<p>But the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t elect somebody I think that they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe can walk and chew gum at the same time.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it feels like we walk and chew gum and juggle on a unicycle all at the same time.\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But I think if you look at the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go back the past six weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen sanctions introduced in the U.N. Security Council that we believe will be voted on next week and approved by the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve passed financial reform through the Senate, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that that bill will be signed into law before the July 4th recess.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve nominated a Supreme Court justice that I believe will be confirmed before the August recess.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve completed fairly recently a new START treaty that we believe will be ratified by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance tomorrow to evaluate the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re making through the jobs report on our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>So we have had a very full agenda, not just in the past 44 or 45 days, but for the past 16 months.\xc2\xa0 But I -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot of people working on a whole lot of things in the White House, and we\xe2\x80\x99re able to do more than several things at once.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the U.S. government knew about the flotilla before the Israeli army confronted it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the Israeli navy confronted it.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration think the purpose of the flotilla was?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration -- does the Obama administration think it was on a humanitarian mission?\xc2\xa0 Does it think it was trying to provoke Israel into a reaction?\xc2\xa0 What was the opinion of the government when it was talking to Israel about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not asked NSC that directly, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I can try to have NSC find out what -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a blockade, as you know, to ensure that weapons are not brought in for Hamas.</p>\n<p>At the same time, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President recently, and certainly the Secretary of State, discuss what we believe is an unsustainable humanitarian presence in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- I assume the President knows that one of the dead was an American.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was his reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told that -- upon being told this, obviously, he expressed his deep condolences, and we certainly express our deep condolences to his family.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is extremely -- extremely horrible news for them.\xc2\xa0 Our ambassador has been in touch with his father.\xc2\xa0 And I would reiterate that we have with the U.N. Security Council condemned the acts that have led to these deaths.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We talked about this before and I understand that it was written the way it was, but by condemning the acts, that could condemn the people on the flotilla to a degree, but since I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s a lane that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to lead anywhere, let me just ask this:\xc2\xa0 Does the fact that one of the victims was an American born in Troy, New York, change at all the U.S. view of what happened or the U.S. position on what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, not to somewhat go down the lane you were talking about, again, I would reiterate we\xe2\x80\x99ve condemned the acts and believe --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can go down that lane actually.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going down the other side of the street that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I already told him it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go anywhere.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but I -- look, we have called for and the U.N. Security Council presidential statement calls for a full and credible investigation so that we have all the facts about what happened, and that is tremendously important and we have -- I said here just a couple of days ago that that could include international participation in that investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it change it to a degree, the fact that one of the dead, one of those killed by the Israeli armed forces, was an American?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that by necessity change the view of the U.S. government, of the American government, as to this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sound callous, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if 10 Greeks are killed or 10 Turks are killed, the U.S. government might condemn the act and think it\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible thing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s different than if an American is killed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which, Jake, is why I started the answer to this question by expressing the deep condolences of the United States government and the President\xe2\x80\x99s condolences.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there continue to be concerns about the deepwater moratorium, drilling moratorium, and the impact that it could have over the next 12 to 18 months on jobs, existing jobs, or platforms moving away and what that would mean to high-paying jobs.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to the potential loss of employment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, this was something that the President discussed with his team prior to the release of the report that halted the 33 existing drilling actions, a situation we didn\xe2\x80\x99t take lightly.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we understand exactly why this accident happened and ensure that if there is something that was preventable, that we ensure that every one of these activities, these drilling permits, takes any of that into account.</p>\n<p>Understand that what got -- what happened in this incident, on the Deepwater Horizon, was after the drilling reached the reservoir of oil, in the process of capping that well.\xc2\xa0 So each of these 33 deepwater permits are in some -- are at some depth toward reaching that well.</p>\n<p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s have an investigation to ensure that the capping of those exploratory wells, with proper blowout preventers, failsafe mechanisms that mean failsafe, that we have a full investigation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the commission is going to look into, a regulatory framework that can ensure safe drilling.</p>\n<p>I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 The President thought that was important, and I think the citizens of the Gulf think that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think Governor Jindal sent that letter.\xc2\xa0 Governor Jindal has been very critical, rightly so, of BP.\xc2\xa0 Four of those drilling permits were either solely or jointly operated by BP.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s got more confidence in their drilling procedures than he does in their response efforts, but the President certainly believed that that was something that needed to be looked into before those permits were continued.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House acknowledges, then, that there will be a loss of jobs --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but this investigation has to go forward to prevent this from happening again.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understand this, there are a loss of jobs because of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, right?\xc2\xa0 Your network and everybody else is interviewing fishermen that can\xe2\x80\x99t fish, right?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re interviewing hotel owners whose hotels -- whose reservations have been canceled.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a zero-sum game.</p>\n<p>And, again, let\xe2\x80\x99s ensure that, as the President outlined and what he wants the commission to look at is that there is a regulatory framework that makes drilling as failsafe as BP and other companies say it is.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that it was a mistake for the President not to meet with fishermen or other local business people during his last visit?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He met with fishermen on May the 1st --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first time.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- when we went down --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about -- there have been -- some criticize that he did not spend enough time talking to the \xe2\x80\x9creal people\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Was that a decision not to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say the Mayor of Grand Isle told -- well, first of all, I think there was pretty large representation of people in that room.\xc2\xa0 The Mayor of Grand Isle, who generally has, as he said, 10,000 people on his beach for Memorial Day weekend wasn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to have any, as he said.\xc2\xa0 He talked about putting his own credit card out to help fishermen who can\xe2\x80\x99t fish meet their expenses.\xc2\xa0 Similar stories that the President got several weeks earlier from fishermen in the Gulf region.</p>\n<p>The President is well aware of the pain and suffering that this accident is causing.\xc2\xa0 And that is why he\xe2\x80\x99s asked that we do everything we can.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why very early on in this process, the Small Business Administration set up a process for many of those small business owners to obtain very low interest loans while economic damages are recovered from BP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this, too, the federal government will at some point today send what I would call a bill for $69 million of expenses incurred up to this point to BP to be reimbursed to the taxpayers as a part of the Oil Pollution Act for expenditures in response, for DOD expenditures in moving assets to the region, for a whole host of things that BP will be paying the taxpayers for.*</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sixty-nine million?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sixty-nine million dollars.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how much time do they have to pay that?\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the time limit is on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is the first bill, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since the White House has been -- or the administration has been calling a lot of the shots on what takes place in this -- in the Gulf, did the White House pressure at all BP to make the kind of public apology that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing from the CEO in the print and also this video release where he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Was the White House -- did the White House push for this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if others had conversations; whether Admiral Allen, who talks with the CEO, has had conversations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt, Dan, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen comments from the CEO that he\xe2\x80\x99s apologized for -- rightly so.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a CEO needs to tell people in the Gulf that there\xe2\x80\x99s not any pollution or he\xe2\x80\x99d like his life back.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s 11 people that we\xe2\x80\x99d all like to have their lives back that were killed the very first night of this incident.\xc2\xa0 And the harm that\xe2\x80\x99s being done there will take years to fix.\xc2\xa0 We will hold BP responsible throughout this process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anyone in the White House yell at him for making those comments?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, with the President first in the Rose Garden threatening or at least talking about the possibility of criminal action and then Holder, Attorney General Holder opening the criminal investigation, has that made the relationship with BP difficult in any way?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, there really seems to be a hostile relationship right now between the two.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about bringing criminal charges against someone and then you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to work with them as a partner to solve a problem, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make the situation more difficult?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, they have an obligation to fix the hole that\xe2\x80\x99s on the bottom of the ocean floor.\xc2\xa0 We have an obligation as the federal government to ensure that the laws of this country have been and are upheld.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that inevitably --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- lead to a more difficult relationship and a more difficult time working together to get this done?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- does the President believe, as some of his critics say, that he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of playing catch up now, that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go very often in the beginning -- this will be only his third trip.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be going more regularly to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- which critic are you talking about?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could name dozens of them.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go with Colin Powell and James Carville, who believe he was too slow out of the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, best I can -- each has said that we ought to have a comprehensive response.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they also said that he should have done what he did when he went down there, he should have done everything two weeks earlier.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their critique was on -- when the President was there on May the 1st so -- or May the 2nd, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it was the day after.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said the visit the other day was a very -- it was a tremendously -- last week was tremendously productive.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It was tremendously productive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if he\xe2\x80\x99d gone two weeks before, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been better -- tremendously --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He went three weeks before, and that visit was also productive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it was tremendously productive that Friday, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been more productive to go the week before and the week before?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He went the week before the week before the week before.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go all those in between.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re right, he did not go each of the last weeks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be in the future, do you think?\xc2\xa0 This is two Fridays in a row.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He will be there as often as the situation dictates.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the worst environmental disaster in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 We are -- we have mobilized the largest federal response in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to make sure that all is being done to plug the leak and to deal with the environmental and economic consequences of what that pollution has caused.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Indonesia still on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 As soon as -- if I do or as soon as I do, I\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly let you guys know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to stay on that theme, how much of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is being changed or altered due to the spill at this point?\xc2\xa0 Can you just describe a little bit of how much of the President\xe2\x80\x99s day, his schedule --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, he gets an update in the Oval Office each day between the daily intelligence briefing and generally the daily economic briefing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who does the update?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Carol and John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 And like a whole host of issues, the President gets regular updates on -- the President gets regular updates on a whole host of issues, including oil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there -- when you see a Jon Stewart mocking the President\xe2\x80\x99s time --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to tell you, Chuck, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched TV in two weeks that isn\xe2\x80\x99t news, so I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I love Jon Stewart, he\xe2\x80\x99s a funny guy, but I have not watched him recently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He critiques on how much time the President is spending on some of the ceremonial aspects of the presidency that he\xe2\x80\x99s had to deal with.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, we\xe2\x80\x99re still the President for -- the President is the President 24 hours a day.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99d suggest we stop doing intelligence briefings on things like Afghanistan and Pakistan because of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Gulf, just like what was going on in Afghanistan and Pakistan didn\xe2\x80\x99t limit what -- our response to the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- on any given day, the President is working on -- even on the quiet days, and there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been many -- even on the quiet days, the President is working on a whole host of issues.</p>\n<p>And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to what I said earlier, the notion somehow that our legislative schedule has somehow been curtailed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we seem to be well on track to get a new Supreme Court justice by the August recess.\xc2\xa0 My hunch is we\xe2\x80\x99ll sign, again, a financial reform bill prior to the July 4th recess.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to get U.N. sanctions against Iran, which not a lot of people thought six weeks ago at the beginning of this spill we had a chance of getting.\xc2\xa0 People didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we had a chance of getting this at the beginning of the week, I would point out.</p>\n<p>So I appreciate that sometimes you guys have one story, you do one story a day.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily deal with just one subject every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A deputy of the Interior Department Sylvia Baca had -- went from the Clinton administration to working for BP; now she\xe2\x80\x99s back in the Obama administration in the Interior Department.\xc2\xa0 Have you asked her to take --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Anybody that\xe2\x80\x99s in -- nobody that comes into this administration can regulate any employer that they worked for previously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s totally been off --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Cannot work for anything related to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was it -- you say you took -- you quoted Tony Hayward just now about his comments that he made about his own life, trying to get his own life back -- do you think at this point he is no longer a helpful face for BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do their PR.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll make their decisions on who they think should brief, who they think should talk to the American people.\xc2\xa0 I do hope this, I do hope that the company continues to answer the questions that I think the American people want to know the answers to.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s important to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing, have you been briefed on the next plan?\xc2\xa0 You know, every time there seems to be every one of these attempts at stopping the leak, the plan -- the next plan has been in the works -- do you -- are you guys aware of the next plan that\xe2\x80\x99s in the works at this phase?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or the next 10 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or at least the next one --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, there are -- there always was -- based on the type of cap that will go on the riser was predicated on the, for lack of a better term, the smoothness of the cut.\xc2\xa0 So I believe there are several different caps that are there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m told that they\xe2\x80\x99re moving ships into the region -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, moving ships over the well.\xc2\xa0 The cap will be lowered in slowly to ensure that the hydrates problem that we encountered with previous attempts you minimize.</p>\n<p>Look, there are -- there will continue to be contingencies on what happens --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The history of the spill already has been each one of these things has failed and then they go to the next thing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand there is one permanent solution.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a relief well.\xc2\xa0 BP began to drill that relief well -- I think one of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly already taken from this is you need to have built-in redundancy into the system.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we asked them to start drilling a second well.\xc2\xa0 And if for some reason a problem is incurred in either of those first two wells, we\xe2\x80\x99ll ask them to drill a third well.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of different scenarios, Chuck, that we\xe2\x80\x99re working through.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Romanoff -- part of the defense on the Joe Sestak matter was that it was an unpaid position and it was done through an intermediary, Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 In this case, these were three paid -- potentially paid positions done by the deputy chief of staff.\xc2\xa0 Does that make the Romanoff job offer fundamentally different and perhaps fundamentally more troubling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a job offer.\xc2\xa0 There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a job promised.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Romanoff applied for a job in government service during the transition.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the fact pattern.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but if I apply for a job and then an employer comes back and says, how about these three, does my application for the job change the fact that I might have been offered those three jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- let\xe2\x80\x99s walk away from your hypothetical, or add to your hypothetical that when you applied for that job you expressed an interest in several different departments like USAID.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, quickly back to BP, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- have you heard anything from the flow rate people at the U.S. Geological Survey on what they are seeing from the cut riser?\xc2\xa0 And do you feel like the images at least are substantiating what you thought would happen and what BP did not think --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, and I will have somebody go -- I do not know of any new estimates on -- from the flow rate technical group.\xc2\xa0 Again, we thought it was important that, based on what we heard from Dr. McNutt at USGS, who\xe2\x80\x99s the head of the flow rate technical group, that cutting the top off that riser would likely -- or could increase the amount of hydrocarbon by 20 percent.</p>\n<p>I do not know if they have -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure that you could altogether ascertain just from the flat-screen image of the riser cut the degree to which that hydrocarbon flow had indeed increased.\xc2\xa0 But let me check on the flow rate --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the U.S. is in charge of this oil spill, why is the BP corporation being -- going to be giving operational updates?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the remotely operated vehicles, the sheer cut operation, is being conducted by them, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, because they have -- they are the only people in this scenario that have the type of technical expertise.\xc2\xa0 In order for a cut with a diamond saw or a sheer cut to happen, the federal on-scene coordinator, Admiral Watson, has to sign off on that -- Rear Admiral Watson, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re fine with BP continuing to have a voice as the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that BP continue to have a voice.\xc2\xa0 There are -- I assume that there are -- look, I love Thad Allen, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are certainly technical questions that BP can and should answer and, look, I think the American people and the citizens of the Gulf are owed an explanation about -- from BP of what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you be a little more specific about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip tomorrow, what his goals are?\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to accomplish and bring home and see any results?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said to Caren, I think that the -- evaluating on the ground every effort of the response, both on the surface of the water and in the environmental damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been done, but also in the economic damage that\xe2\x80\x99s been and being done in the Gulf to small business owners everywhere down there.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance, again, to talk to some of those folks and get a chance to get -- talk directly with Admiral Allen again, as well as understand how the -- each state in the Gulf is implementing its own state response plan and whatever concerns they have in wanting to augment the plans developed by them for a spill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a fact-finding trip?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will want to hear any update that\xe2\x80\x99s going on but also hear directly from -- as he did in the first trip, hear from non-elected individuals who are also suffering firsthand at this, as are those that those officials represent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question on the flotilla.\xc2\xa0 Before this incident happened, the U.S. government urged Israel to exercise caution and restraint.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House feel that Israel heeded those words?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say there are a lot of questions that you all may have that I think will be helped by the investigation that the United States has called for.\xc2\xa0 We would continue to encourage Israel to -- while maintaining a blockade not to have -- I think we all -- none of us want a repeat of what happened.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much meeting of the minds was there in the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today with Arizona Governor Brewer?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was not in the meeting, but I think you heard her say and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a readout from our office that will go out discussing efforts that the administration has made along the border with the National Guard and other devices to strengthen border security; obviously a long discussion about comprehensive immigration reform, which, again, I think you heard the governor discuss, which is the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to solve this crisis.\xc2\xa0 It is not going to be solved by one method alone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said that she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see construction of a fence begin in a month or so.\xc2\xa0 Is that likely?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I need to get an update on that.\xc2\xa0 I saw that out of the meeting and I have not had a chance to talk to anybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the -- China\xe2\x80\x99s decision to rescind the invitation to Secretary Gates, do you see that as a direct result of the Taiwan arms sale?\xc2\xa0 Is there another reason for it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d direct you to the Department of Defense on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have implications for U.S.-China relations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we have -- there was a -- you have two countries that disagreed on our arms sales, and countries like China and the United States are going to have times in which, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s North Korean sanctions in front of the U.N. last year or Iran sanctions in front of the U.N. this year, where we agree, and there will be issues that we disagree on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you have in international relations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on the commission -- the oil spill commission.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe everything should be on the table in terms of the recommendations that the commission might ultimately come to in regards to future of oil drilling?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so does that include the possibility that they could recommend that the risks of drilling in deepwater are simply too great and that it should be stopped?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I assume they will look at that, and I think the President would want to be assured -- as he certainly said in meetings here -- that at the very least, you have to have a plan, a credible plan for responding to what potentially could happen to ensure that you can stop something that you start, which 45 days later we know BP is not showing good results on.</p>\n<p>I will say this.\xc2\xa0 We have -- there are thousands of wells in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- as we have slowed deepwater permits, we have continued exploratory drilling in shallow water.\xc2\xa0 That continues, and they\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating -- continue to evaluate permits to continue to drill in shallow water because we -- I think the last time I saw the number was around 60 percent of our oil is imported from overseas.\xc2\xa0 We have to break our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 The President outlined a comprehensive strategy that included more drilling because -- well, because we have to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to take steps to break our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in a whole host of clean energy projects through the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re all still driving cars.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess that almost suggests that he -- that if they were to come back and say, look, as there are environmentalists and others out there who say drilling is just too dangerous, fundamentally in that deep of water just is never going to be safe --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President -- I think the President has been very candid in both -- in asking this commission to look at not just the companies, but obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s not spared the government the rod on this as well, in terms of ensuring that there\xe2\x80\x99s a regulatory framework that works for the American people.</p>\n<p>Again, we -- there are, as I -- there are thousands of wells down there that are producing oil that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use right now.\xc2\xa0 So the commission has a lot of breadth in dealing with and in examining that regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on the setting up the commission, do you have any guidance on when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be naming the rest of the folks?\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re finishing that up now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the staff that -- I mean, they have to find the place to meet and all that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They will find an executive director and relevant staff, too, to begin to handle a whole host of questions, one of which they\xe2\x80\x99ll look at which are these -- which are the 33 current permits that have been frozen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you just said earlier that you\xe2\x80\x99re very confident that the U.S. will be able to get through an Iran sanctions resolution through the U.N.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying then that the Israeli flotilla incident had no effect at all on our efforts on Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously not spoken with each member -- each of the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 I think the President and the team here remain confident that we start with the P5-plus-1 in support of that resolution and believe that when that resolution is voted on, likely within the next week, that they will have a number that will pass that resolution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back to taking the President\xe2\x80\x99s emotional temperature, I just want to get back to something that Jake asked you about on the American who was killed in the flotilla.\xc2\xa0 You said the President was very sorry.\xc2\xa0 Was he angry?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was told he expressed his condolences.\xc2\xa0 I was not -- this I think was during the PDB, and I was not in the PDB.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly, Robert, on the Romanoff issue, are there other offers that have been made to clear primary opponents away?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Besides the two that we know about, are there other offers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, your defense of this practice, can we expect the White House staff will continue to look on that as a possible means of preventing people running against each other?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I would draw you to the circumstances that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in each one of these cases, Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re peculiar, they\xe2\x80\x99re not -- those circumstances are not likely to be repeated?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this likely to happen again?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you to the -- I would point you to the fact pattern in each one of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a quick question on the meeting with the Governor of Arizona.\xc2\xa0 She said the solution for the illegal immigration problem should be border security first, and then immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe in that for the solution?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President believes that there are -- those things have to happen together.\xc2\xa0 Look, if there was one solution to this crisis, my guess is somebody would have either tried it or done it long ago.\xc2\xa0 We know that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has outlined his beliefs on this.\xc2\xa0 His record in the Senate demonstrate this.\xc2\xa0 And the work that he\xe2\x80\x99s done here to encourage a bipartisan solution to a very emotional issue is something he continues to work on.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, the United States has existing economic sanctions against North Korea under the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874.\xc2\xa0 Will the U.S. continue to provide humanitarian aid to North Korea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any change in that, but I will double-check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, question on the National Guard troops heading down to the border.\xc2\xa0 In his news conference last week, the President said this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a response to the Arizona immigration law; in fact, it was part of a plan that had been discussed since as early as last year.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, what is it a response to?\xc2\xa0 What happened to make him think the border wasn\xe2\x80\x99t secure enough right now?**</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a problem that has -- this is a problem that has -- I think if you go back several administrations you see that at different time periods there have been more National Guard on the border.\xc2\xa0 During the Clinton administration, I think at four different times they moved members of the National Guard to the border; several different times during the Bush administration.</p>\n<p>Obviously, what has the -- what President Calder\xc3\xb3n has done to fight crime and gangs is something that has caused increased violence as well.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the full and credible report on the flotilla incident, just for timing purposes -- well, first of all, who\xe2\x80\x99s doing it?\xc2\xa0 Do you know who is actually --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an Israeli investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an Israeli investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, wait, you guys didn\xe2\x80\x99t support -- you guys came out supporting for an independent investigation, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, which is why I said two days ago that that could include international participation.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything about the timing of a report like that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about like a week or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another scheduling thing -- the Indonesia trip is still on the schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I said earlier to Chip --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think my hearing isn\xe2\x80\x99t working, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still on the schedule?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I spoke in Indonesian.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 If anything changes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and also just could you say how the meeting with Governor Brewer came about?\xc2\xa0 Was that by -- did the White House invite her, and why?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think she requested the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when she requested it.\xc2\xa0 I saw an e-mail several days ago that we were adding that meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why did the President decide he wanted to do that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I -- look, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to deal with the immigration issue without dealing with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening along the border, and certainly Arizona is a big part of that.</p>\n<p>Obviously, Arizona has taken -- because of a lack of a federal response in comprehensive immigration reform, has pointed to state efforts that the President believes could be harmful.\xc2\xa0 And the Justice Department is evaluating that law for further action.\xc2\xa0 But, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with comprehensive immigration reform and the circumstances around the border without dealing with Arizona.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two-parter.\xc2\xa0 I think even after seeing Governor Brewer come back out, many of us are not really clear what the point -- I mean, did anything actually get accomplished in there?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that he\xe2\x80\x99s of any closer of a mind with her on some of these conflicts?\xc2\xa0 And do you expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see any other follow-ups with her?\xc2\xa0 She said some officials are going down there.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going down there, is he?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- did anything actually happen?\xc2\xa0 Or did they just like talk a lot?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be -- what are meetings like at McClatchy?\xc2\xa0 Because I -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the wrong meetings.\xc2\xa0 You know, occasionally we look at our -- well, more than occasionally we look at our BlackBerries, but I -- look, there are viewpoints that she has, clearly, and were expressed in her signature on a law about how we deal with immigration.</p>\n<p>As was said earlier, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a point of view that you have to do border security first.\xc2\xa0 The President has a view that we have to have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Margaret, I saw the Governor say that one of the results of the meeting is I think she believes will be better communication between the administration and her state.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s always a positive development.</p>\n<p>But, look, the President has talked about this, the President talked about this at the Republican Caucus, and the President has talked about it here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 John McCain was very instrumental in getting immigration reform to the point that it was in 2005, 2006 and 2007.\xc2\xa0 I doubt we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get comprehensive immigration reform if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have John McCain doing what he believed in those years.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the governor of that state, and hopefully will let both the senators of Arizona and throughout the country know that the way to best deal with immigration reform is to do it comprehensively at a federal level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another quick question.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was the planning for the summer --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do want to know about the McClatchy meetings, by the way --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anytime you\xe2\x80\x99d like to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That sounds --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- spend the morning at our shop, you\xe2\x80\x99re formally welcome.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to the Obamas planning their summer, is there any discussion now in light of the oil spill to them perhaps vacationing on a Gulf beach?\xc2\xa0 Maybe that would be disruptive, but is that something that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been involved in their August plans.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two brief questions.\xc2\xa0 You said it was in the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see that supporters of his are not in a political conflict.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s fully committed to campaigning for and supporting Congressman Kendrick Meek, the certain Democratic nominee for the Senate in Florida?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He supports his campaign for Senate, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll campaign for him?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a campaign schedule in front of me, but we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of Congressman Meek.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing I wanted to ask you was, I forwarded you my correspondence from KBR, the spinoff company from Halliburton, which won a bid in a competitive contract, had it retained in an apparent no-bid contract.\xc2\xa0 Could you address that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you mentioned in that e-mail, it appeared as if the contract was simply -- was, as you said, retained after a competitive bidding process, which I think is consistent with everyone\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if DOD has anything else to offer on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as contradicting the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement about no-bid?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A purely factual question:\xc2\xa0 $69 million -- can you break that down for us in a way that we can sort of extrapolate the rate at which the government is spending money and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be billing BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have -- I left one sheet on my desk on this but I think LaBolt has that.\xc2\xa0 Give me one second and I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that the sum total of the costs incurred so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Up to this point, yes.\xc2\xa0 Let me get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the government --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 By the U.S. government, yes.\xc2\xa0 Let me -- give me one second and I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- Ben LaBolt, please come to the front.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 See if he\xe2\x80\x99s watching.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big test.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Poor guy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say over and over again around the country in these speeches that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- where he decries sort of the Washington business as usual culture, and your defense of these two incidents with Sestak and Romanoff, if I understand them, is essentially that this is Washington business as usual.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that undercuts his larger argument and do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any hypocrisy there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think the -- the ethics laws that we have that our administration lives by; the transparency of allowing you to understand who comes into this White House, who they meet with, and when they come; not taking political contributions during the campaign from lobbyists and PACs, are differences in the way that Washington work, Glenn, and those are efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99re quite proud of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about necessarily laws, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about sort of the optics of the situation, and this is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I just outlined --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- none of those are laws.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Those were executive orders and decisions that the President made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is more than just sort of procedures and structure.\xc2\xa0 This is an article of faith for the President.\xc2\xa0 He talks about this stuff all the time.\xc2\xa0 Does this disturb him at all?\xc2\xa0 Does he want to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I did not talk to him about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, wait a minute, about Sestak you didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have his opinion?\xc2\xa0 He asked specifically about Romanoff, but did he have an opinion about what happened with the Sestak situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about Sestak -- on Friday I was with him in the Gulf and we were working on oil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And other than those two, Robert, you guys have not tried to dissuade others --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Paterson?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You ticked off a bunch of the things that you guys have been doing, but you didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 Have you put that on the shelf, closing Guantanamo, or where does that stand right now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, and in fact I think a report was recently I think sent to Congress and recently made public of the evaluations that were done of the inmates at the Guantanamo prison.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any updates on decisions about criminal trials, though -- I have not heard that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, does the news about a death of an American change the White House\xe2\x80\x99s perspective?\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Turks were among the most vocal in criticizing the response from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk about maybe reevaluating, going back at this, and making either another statement or weighing in somehow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we -- our statement and the actions of the Security Council and -- obviously the President had a good conversation two days ago with Prime Minister Erdogan and I think it is important, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that a full and credible investigation be had to understand exactly what the facts are.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Senator Webb outlined in Bangkok his reasons for cancelling his Burma visit, and I wonder is the President still committed to the dialogue --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 LaBolt is missing, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The guy\xe2\x80\x99s working until like 10:00 at night and he probably found lunch.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry about that.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still committed to the dialogue with Burma\xe2\x80\x99s military government?\xc2\xa0 And is there consideration being given to the special envoy that Senator Webb also --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with -- I just saw briefly that but I have not a lot of guidance on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You, again -- you listed a number of things that you plan to do legislatively.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specifically that you want to accomplish before the visit of the Russian President expected later this month?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there will be -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything legislatively prior to that.\xc2\xa0 I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly sent the START -- the New START treaty and the material up to the Senate, just as it has been done in Russia, and expect that we will continue to make progress and see that that treaty is ratified by year\xe2\x80\x99s end.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Sestak and Romanoff, I understand that the White House wanted to avoid a costly primary fight in each of those races, but what kind of message does this offering or dangling of job opportunities send to the people in those states who actually wanted a choice for their candidate, considering that both Specter and Michael Bennet were neither elected -- both were pushed -- not pushed -- let into office either through a party switch or an appointment from the governor?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of message is sent to the voters in those states who didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- who wanted a choice for their candidate for Senate -- the Democratic primary --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously Pennsylvania is -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a primary and that\xe2\x80\x99s been done.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President is supportive of -- as we said months ago -- supportive of incumbent Senator Michael Bennet, somebody who has done groundbreaking work first as a superintendent and is involved with a whole host of things that the President is supportive of, particularly as it relates to ethics reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the argument among people like -- including a defender of yours, Richard Painter, the Bush ethics lawyer who actually defended the practice, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s seedy in the sense that you\xe2\x80\x99re not giving people a choice in the primary.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tim, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a -- each individual state decides I believe how a vacancy is going to be filled and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into those 50 state decisions.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert, instant replay in baseball?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my team now, be careful.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Detroit.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you and I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, all right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you speaking for yourself here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking with the full weight of the federal government -- (laughter) -- for whatever that\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xc2\xa0 No, let me say -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 I hope that baseball awards a perfect game to that pitcher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do it.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s early.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, we\xe2\x80\x99re working on -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work on an executive order.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I will say this -- I think that -- I have a six-year-old right now who\xe2\x80\x99s playing baseball.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a son?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I missed his game.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a few pictures of your kids, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Something we can all be proud of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I missed his game last night -- three hits, just saying.\xc2\xa0 But I think everybody that watched what happened and understood -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been 20 perfect games in the history of baseball.\xc2\xa0 To watch an umpire take responsibility and to watch a pitcher do what he did, the type of sportsmanship that was exhibited there -- I think that gives a lot of heart, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a six-year-old just learning how to play baseball, Kirk, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re somebody like you or I who have -- who watch baseball for the sheer enjoyment of the game -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously heartening to see somebody understand that they made a mistake and somebody accept the apology from somebody who made that mistake.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good lesson in baseball.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s probably a good lesson in Washington.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did the President have to say about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:22 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
