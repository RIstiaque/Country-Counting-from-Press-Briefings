EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 All right, so we got a couple of things today that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through.\xc2\xa0 Let me start with -- I will start real quickly with a National Security Council personnel announcement.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a very quick week ahead.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear from Secretary Geithner on a couple of topics, namely today is the first day that Americans will begin to see in their paychecks the impact of the payroll tax cut that was part of the overall tax agreement that the President signed at the end of December, so -- and have a few comments about China before we then hear from Tom Donilon, the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, who will walk through both the scheduling and some of the top lines on what we will see next week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut before I do that, I want to make two quick personnel announcements.\xc2\xa0 Mike Hammer, who many of you know and has been helpful to many of you, is leaving the White House for far greener pastures at the Department of State.\xc2\xa0 He will be the principal deputy assistant secretary for public affairs.\xc2\xa0 That then leaves an opening as the National Security Staff spokesperson.\xc2\xa0 That will be filled by -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud to announce -- that will be filled by Tommy Vietor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So that is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Please call him on weekends.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The little boy is all grown up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So that is -- I am pleased to make that announcement both -- I hired Tommy about two months after I came into the Obama operation, and Mike has been, as he has been to you all, a tremendous resource for all of us here.\xc2\xa0 We will miss him but he is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving the White House to be greatly promoted.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me do the quick week ahead and let\xe2\x80\x99s get to Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President and the First Lady will participate in a local community service event.\xc2\xa0 I am of course for security reasons, Ms. Ryan, not going to get into that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A homeless shelter, possibly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A homeless shelter possibly, or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good to have you back, Ms. Ryan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday -- and Tom will get into this more -- the President and the First Lady will host President Hu Jintao of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China for a state visit.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll save the majority of that for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And on Friday, the President will host a reception here at the White House for mayors that are in town for meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd with that, that was quick and abbreviated, but let me turn this over to Secretary Geithner.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Tax cuts -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important for you all to understand that the power and impact of these tax cuts depends in part on people understanding that they\'re coming and they\'re happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we want to highlight the fact today, as Robert said, that tens of millions of Americans get paid today.\xc2\xa0 And this tax cut, which is $112 billion; it goes to 159 million working families in the country -- means on average that people will see their take-home pay go up -- average worker -- by about $700 this year; average working family by about over $1,000 this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you an example.\xc2\xa0 If you think about a married couple in Detroit, a teacher and a mechanic, they\'re going to see their take-home pay go up by about $1,300 this year.\xc2\xa0 So this is a very substantial increase in the amount of people -- in the amount of cash people see in their pockets, and it makes a big difference for struggling families coming.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to know that this tax package has the largest, most powerful incentive for business investment I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever done as a country.\xc2\xa0 So every business in America this year will be able to fully deduct the cost of buying a new piece of equipment -- a new tractor -- putting that into service.\xc2\xa0 And already across the country you\'re seeing businesses decide how they can best take advantage of this.\xc2\xa0 But we want to make sure that all businesses know that this is in the package and they can start to take advantage of it.\xc2\xa0 For the business incentives, it means that roughly 2 million businesses are going to see the cost of an investment fall by about 75 percent. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, the economy was starting to strengthen in the fall, but in significant part because of the impact of this tax package, you\'re seeing most private economists say the economy this year is likely to grow between 3 and 4 percent and the range of private forecasters have said this package is likely to add about 1.5 million jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, I just want to highlight:\xc2\xa0 The more people understand what\'s in the package, the more power it\'s going to have in getting Americans back to work and strengthening the momentum of recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow, Tom is going to talk about the meetings with China coming up next week, our objectives.\xc2\xa0 I just want to say a few things on the economic side, because it\'s very important to understand that this is a relationship that has huge economic benefits to Americans.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to hear us talk very openly and candidly about our concerns and our objectives in the Chinese market, just as you\'re going to hear the Chinese talk about their concerns and their expectations for how to make sure they have continued access to United States technology, United States markets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut it\'s very important to understand that this is a relationship with very substantial economic benefits to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Last year our exports to China passed the $100 billion mark.\xc2\xa0 They\'re growing at about twice the pace of our exports to the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 What that means is our exports to China will double in the next four to five years, and that means China is likely to become our largest trading partner sometime roughly 10 years from today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd already, because of the things we\'ve put in place, the opportunities American companies enjoy in China are expanding quite substantially.\xc2\xa0 And the relative competitiveness of American companies, American products, American ideas, American services is already moving in our favor, because the Chinese are allowing their currency to now strengthen.\xc2\xa0 And just one thing to understand about the exchange rate -- and I\'m sure Tom would like the chance to talk about the technical financial instruments in much more detail --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to the opportunity.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t advise it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Be careful when he says that.\xc2\xa0 No, I want to make sure you understand one thing.\xc2\xa0 What matters to competitiveness is what happens to inflation and what happens to the value of the currency you can see in the markets every day.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the combined move in the currency and the combined move in inflation rates that affects competitiveness -- whether a company wants to buy a good from a Chinese producer or an American producer. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd if you just look at the trajectory -- because Chinese inflation is much more rapid than the United States now; Chinese inflation is probably going to be more than twice, three times U.S. inflation rates for a long time to come -- the exchange rates now are appreciating in real terms, which is what matters, at roughly a pace of about 10 percent a year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd even though we\'re in the early stage of that adjustment process, again, one thing about economics and about business that\'s important to know is that already companies today can look ahead and they see that change coming and they\'re going to be making investments today based on the expectation -- based on this new fundamental reality, which is the competitiveness is going to be shifting now in our favor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI want to make sure that\xe2\x80\x99s -- you understand that because -- and understand the benefits in this -- because you\'re going to hear a lot of cooperation in this relationship, a lot of challenge, but it\'s important to recognize how large the stakes we have and how much we\'re benefiting from the gains you\'re seeing in exports already.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll take a couple of quick questions, if anybody has one for Secretary Geithner.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMatt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Secretary, the tax cut package that you have been touting here today, will this in any way cause you to increase your projected GDP growth forecast, and if so to what extent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 The forecast that the CBO put out is coming and I won\'t foreshadow that.\xc2\xa0 But again, what you should -- what we do and what I think your readers should do and people who watch you should do is they should look at what private forecasters are saying.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the average of what private forecasters are saying -- business economists, et cetera -- what they\'re saying now is that the economy is likely to grow between 3 and 4 percent this year, which is substantially stronger than what people thought this summer, for example.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s partly as a result of the tax package and it\'s partly because the economy was gaining some momentum over the course of the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\'re comfortable with that forecast of 3 to 4 percent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s a good measure of what you\'re seeing, which is you\'re seeing a little more confidence, you\'re seeing a little bit more spark to recovery, and you\'re seeing people starting to invest and accelerate their hiring plans on that expectation there\'s going to be growing demand for their products.\xc2\xa0 And I think that confidence is justified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Chinese currency, does the inclusion of inflation mean that the currency is appreciating fast enough for you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Let me try one more time.\xc2\xa0 The exchange rate has moved about -- up about a little over 3 percent since they started to move against the dollar since June of last year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an annual rate of about 6 percent, maybe 7-8 percent a year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut that\'s not the best measure of competitiveness of an American good or service, or American innovation.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the combined effect of that change and the difference between China\xe2\x80\x99s inflation rate and ours.\xc2\xa0 And because Chinese inflation is accelerating, and it\xe2\x80\x99s much more rapid than U.S. inflation, the right measure of the pace of appreciation is now more than 10 percent a year.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a very substantial material change.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe last time China let the currency move over a two-year period, it moved up about 20 percent against the dollar.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a very substantial, meaningful shift.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The only question for China is whether it happens more through inflation or more through the exchange rate itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd again, the important thing is, though, again, even though they\'re only in the early stage of this process, companies now -- because they have to plan ahead -- will be making decisions on the reality that that competitive balance is now going to be moving once again in our favor, and that\'s a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by that measure of appreciation, is that sufficient, or there are further steps that the Chinese need to take?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, our view still is -- and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial -- and this is in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest -- our view is that we still think it\xe2\x80\x99s in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest to let the currency appreciate more rapidly.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very much in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest that that adjustment that has to come comes more in the exchange rate than inflation because China doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see rapid inflation, just like we don\'t in this case.\xc2\xa0 And if they continue to try to suppress the rate of growth in the currency itself, the risk they face is they see more inflation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNice to see you all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April -- let\xe2\x80\x99s do April, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, what are the anticipated questions or conversations on U.S. debt to China?\xc2\xa0 And also, you said that American exports in the next four to five years will double --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 To China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To China, right.\xc2\xa0 But still, even so, there will still be a vast imbalance of exports from China to here versus U.S. product over there.\xc2\xa0 So what are you trying to do to bridge that gap and that divide?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Well, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that China is growing, they\'re less reliant on exports, they let their exchange rate move up, and they are providing a more level playing field for American companies operating in China.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, that\'s happening. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut it is important to remember that our economy is much larger than China.\xc2\xa0 Americans earn much more than does the average Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, we still import more from China than we export to China.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a function of the relative size of our economies.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise in that.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a reflection of Chinese strength.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really more a reflection of the relative size and strength of our economy still.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 What about the conversation on U.S. debt to China?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 Oh, there will be no -- I mean, nothing -- as in any conversation we have with almost any country, we talk about how their economy is doing, what their challenges are, and we talk about our challenges and our policies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the Chinese understand that the President is committed to making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing things to make this country stronger.\xc2\xa0 And they understand that to do that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to find ways to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re spending the taxpayer resources more wisely, spending less, and we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place the kind of policies to make sure we restore a sense of broad balance to our fiscal position.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to that.\xc2\xa0 No one is going to care more about that than the President and me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting any kind of deliverables or agreements as a result of this visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSECRETARY GEITHNER:\xc2\xa0 That\'s for Tom.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner, can you clarify where discussions are on the tax code?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can take that in a second.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to Tom.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much, and thanks for taking the time to talk about foreign policy a little bit this afternoon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tActually, the last time I spoke to this large a group of you, it was in Yokohama, Japan, at the end of our nine-day excursion throughout Asia.\xc2\xa0 Now that you spoke up, Chip, I do remember your -- Chip\xe2\x80\x99s blog the next day saying, well, you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to have to see; only time will tell whether the trip was a success.\xc2\xa0 Are they going to get the KORUS agreed to, are they going to get exports ramped up in Asia -- so I think we did okay on that score.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I wanted to talk today about the China trip, but I wanted to set it up also.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been an exceedingly busy time for American leadership and national security affairs in the world.\xc2\xa0 If you think about just the beginning of that trip, the trip that we took to India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan leaving on November 5th, if you just look at a number of things that have happened since then, it really is quite extraordinary. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe did that trip, which was an extraordinary trip, to India, where we fully embraced India\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a great power and a great partner for the United States; Indonesia, with a very important trip there; and then on to the summits in Korea and Japan.\xc2\xa0 We did come back, all kidding aside, and get agreement on the Korea free trade agreement, which of course will be the second largest trade agreement this country has entered into since NAFTA.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe then went on the next weekend to the Lisbon summit, where we were able to get an agreement on European defense, ballistic missile defense initiative; get agreement there on an overall approach to Afghanistan, setting forth the framework, if you will, the plan for going forward in Afghanistan, beginning transition in the first part of 2011, beginning the U.S. drawdown in the summer of 2011, and turning over complete responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghans by 2014. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe got endorsements at the summit from very important countries, including the countries that border Russia, for the START agreement, which I think were very important in terms of the debate.\xc2\xa0 We then went on and worked through our Afghan-Pakistan review and we briefed you all fully on that, obviously.\xc2\xa0 We had to deal with North Korean provocations during the month of December, in concert with our allies and friends in the region.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal was passed by the Congress.\xc2\xa0 Government formation went forward in Iraq, and the Vice President was just there and we made good progress on that.\xc2\xa0 And finally in the waning hours of the Congress we finished the START treaty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI lay that out just to indicate the demand for U.S. leadership around the world and the level of activity that the United States is engaged in right now around the world.\xc2\xa0 And even if you think about the last few days, the Secretary of State has been in the Gulf on a very highly visible and very important trip, including to very important partners there in our counterterrorism efforts.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates has been in Asia -- China, Korea, and Japan -- in the last few days.\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President was in Iraq, again, continuing to work on our projects in Iraq, our interests in Iraq, and then on to South Asia in Afghanistan and, again, Pakistan -- again, demonstrating the level of activity and the demand for U.S. leadership and the necessity of U.S. leadership around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd that leads us to China.\xc2\xa0 A state visit -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you through the schedule maybe at the top -- is a schedule, again, beginning next Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 A couple of points about this before I go through the details of the schedule.\xc2\xa0 We have as a strategic matter from the outset of this administration worked very hard to get great power relationships right, with positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationships, as we are seeking with China, with great powers.\xc2\xa0 A lot is possible in terms of us pursuing our interests and in pursuing global interests. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd China is a very good example of that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve concentrated on this very, very carefully -- and not to pursue the relationship just through summitry every year, every two years, but rather through a very intense and persistent engagement with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, I think Secretary Clinton delivered a speech this morning on China, who called it a careful study in dynamic stewardship of the United States-China relationship.\xc2\xa0 And obviously I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to that as the way to characterize how we go about this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe numbers say something about this -- this will be the eighth face-to-face meeting between President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also -- the President has also met with Premier Wen three times, and that\xe2\x80\x99s in -- coming on 24 months now, that pace and intensity of engagement with the Chinese reflects the breadth, depth, and importance of the relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Chinese -- one other lead-in point -- the China relationship obviously is also cited in our Asia policy.\xc2\xa0 And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to a number of you about in other settings here, when we were thinking about our foreign policy in the campaign but also during the transition and coming into office, we got the chance to ask ourselves where were we under-involved, where we were over-involved, how did we want to revise America\xe2\x80\x99s footprint in the world, America\xe2\x80\x99s face to the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd it was our analysis -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s an analysis that we acted on from the first days of this administration, when Secretary Clinton was the first Secretary of State since Dean Rusk to have her first trip abroad be to Asia -- we came to the conclusion that in fact we had not given Asia, given the historic trends in Asia during the course of the 2000s -- I mean, the China rise, the economic dynamism in Asia, the economically most dynamic part of the world -- that in fact the United States was under-involved in Asia in terms of presence, involvement, diplomacy, and resources.\xc2\xa0 And we set about correcting that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that, as I said, assiduously since the beginning of the administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat has three or four elements to it.\xc2\xa0 That has sheer presence and activity, and that\xe2\x80\x99s I think reflected in the activity of our most senior diplomats and others in our government.\xc2\xa0 The President has taken two extensive trips to Asia in November of 2009 and then the trip I referenced earlier in December -- November of this year.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the work we\xe2\x80\x99re doing with our allies in the region, really revitalizing those alliances.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOur alliance with the South Koreans -- you know, I am loathe to use kind of hyperbolic terms, but I do think the relationship with the South Koreans is frankly in as good a shape as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been right now -- very solid.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that through the United States activity and cooperation in the wake of the North Korean provocations, in the wake of the North Koreans essentially killing 50 South Koreans, including 40-something on a corvette ship, the Cheonan, and then four in the islands incident, and us standing shoulder to shoulder with them.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that manifested not just in words but in deeds with our bringing the George Washington into the Yellow Sea and exercising with the South Koreans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Japan alliance is also a cornerstone of our work in Asia and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us work very hard on that from the outset of the administration.\xc2\xa0 A number of you were on our first trip to Asia -- Helene and others were on the trip to Japan -- and I think if you look at the progress of that alliance, the quality of it since then, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen I think tremendous improvement -- indeed, to the point where Prime Minister Kan, when the President was in Yokohama in November, said that the importance of U.S. presence and leadership in Asia had never been more important.\xc2\xa0 And we are working well very with the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates gave a very important speech yesterday about the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be celebrating that alliance\xe2\x80\x99s 50th year this year in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe third piece of the -- our effort there is to engage rising countries in Asia, and that was on display I think in our work on the India-Indonesia trip.\xc2\xa0 We really have deepened these relationships.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd fourth, our strategy involves building the architecture, if you will, of organizations in Asia.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting APEC this year, an economic facilitation organization.\xc2\xa0 We have hosted the ASEAN leaders twice now.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has hosted the ASEAN leaders twice now.\xc2\xa0 We are moving in basically kind of at the ground floor the development of the East Asia Summit, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- that summit will be this fall in Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a region in need of kind of knitting together -- economic, political, and security organizations -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re deeply involved in that.\xc2\xa0 You know, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a debate in the foreign policy circles about how deeply to get into that and whether to wait for them to develop before we get in, and we made a decision to go in, embrace the process, and build it up with full participation by the United States as a Pacific power, as a power in the region that has provided the security out there on which basically the economic miracle has been built.\xc2\xa0 And every country in the region has benefited by the United States security efforts in that region, including China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd of course another big piece of this is our relationship with China, the principal power in the region, which is why we have given this so much attention.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the schedule.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Robert, but, you know, you invite me out, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give them a little --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONLION:\xc2\xa0 -- might as well give them the whole thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, as I go through the analysis of our Asia policy and whereas China is cited in that policy, we are absolutely determined -- you can tell by the presentation -- to meet our commitments and obligations to the countries in the region; to be a reliable partner; to have the resources presence; to be able to support our obligations and relationships with those countries.\xc2\xa0 We are an important source of security and balance in that region. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAt the same time, those nations -- anticipating the question I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get about encircling China and things like that -- those nations absolutely count on the United States to engage in a productive, positive relationship with China, to manage that relationship with China, because that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very important part of the stability and security in the region.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s where our relationship with China is kind of cited in our overall strategy, and I appreciate your patience for allowing me to go through that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn the China schedule, as I said, President Hu Jintao and his delegation will arrive on the evening of Tuesday, January 18th, at Andrews Air Force Base.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be greeted at Andrews by Vice President Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, and the Chief of Protocol, Ambassador Capricia Marshall.\xc2\xa0 That evening, the President will host a small private dinner for President Hu here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 That dinner will be attended by the President, myself, and Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 And the Chinese will similarly have two folks on the other side.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very unusual -- unusually small dinner that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have with President Hu, again reflecting the relationship that we are evolving, and the opportunity to have candid conversation in much less formal settings than you typically would see, frankly, in a meeting between the Chinese and the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where will the dinner be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be in the residence or in the dining room?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is in the Old Family Dining Room in the residence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an arrival ceremony outside?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that in a second.\xc2\xa0 Yes, okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the Vice President at that dinner?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.\xc2\xa0 And again -- and the Chinese, of course, will match up similarly on their side, would be my expectation.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to announce their participants, though, for the reasons you can understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Tom, you said it\xe2\x80\x99s just you and the President and who --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Clinton.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With spouses or no?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Not with spouses.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, the 19th, there will be an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn on the morning of the 19th; and then a small bilateral in the Oval Office, the classic pattern here; and then an expanded bilateral meeting in the Cabinet Room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAfter the two bilateral meetings, the two Presidents -- President Obama and President Hu -- will then meet for about 45 minutes with U.S. and Chinese business leaders and CEOs in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the way here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe focus of that discussion will be on ways to expand trade and investment opportunities between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 There will be American CEOs who have large interests and investments in China.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be discussion there about how American business can better do business in China, to talk about the access issues that are so very important and that Secretary Geithner talked about in his speech yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese CEOs from prominent Chinese companies who have investments in the United States will talk about their activities here, and how they came to make those investments and create jobs in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFollowing the meetings of the CEOs over at the Old Executive Office Building, the two Presidents will have a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Following the press conference, President Hu will then attend the State Department luncheon hosted by Vice President Biden and Secretary Clinton at the State Department, as I said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd beginning at 6 p.m. that evening, the state dinner will occur here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding -- and again, go to the Chinese to get the details on this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding then on Wednesday, President Hu will have separate meetings with the leadership of the House and the Senate; will then give a speech at a luncheon hosted by -- I don\'t have my glasses here -- hosted by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, the U.S.-China Business Council and other organizations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFollowing that speech, President Hu will then depart Andrews Air Force Base for a set of events in Chicago the next day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is Thursday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the schedule.\xc2\xa0 The details Ben and Tommy can get into any of the -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve exhausted my knowledge of the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the East Room presser, time and how many questions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two and two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what time will that be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the exact time.\xc2\xa0 My guess is, given the schedule that was just written out, that\'s probably -- whatever time I would give you is likely to slip a bit.\xc2\xa0 But it is two and two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meeting with House and Senate leadership is Wednesday afternoon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of coverage on that meeting with the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- yes, Wednesday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Thursday -- separate meeting with the leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The coverage on the CEOs we\xe2\x80\x99re working on right now.\xc2\xa0 I expect that to be over, as Tom said, in EEOB.\xc2\xa0 And that will be full pool.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Any other questions on that?\xc2\xa0 Okay, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have to be on the China visit or can it be on anything as long as we --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got a couple more things to say about the China visit.\xc2\xa0 But is there anything else on the schedule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be joint statements announced?\xc2\xa0 Will there be joint statements announced by the two leaders --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 A joint --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Joint statement --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 A joint statement -- I don\'t want to comment on that prior to the visit at this point.\xc2\xa0 Okay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Any other schedule things?\xc2\xa0 Tom will go through some more points, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me just do -- and again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of our thinking presented to you during the course of this week by the most senior members of the administration -- Secretary Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s speech, Secretary Locke\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and then this morning, Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech -- which our intent was leading up to the visit to give a comprehensive view of our thoughts and our approach on the relationship.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just talk about this just a couple more minutes if I might.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 The way we kind of think about how to have this conversation with -- you asked about the conversation earlier, about how we have this conversation with the Chinese, essentially what the baskets of discussion topics are. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe first basket is clearly the overall relationship -- the tone of that relationship, its purpose, where the areas -- where were there areas of cooperation; do we have the right mechanisms in place; and again, and how we see that relationship developing over the next 10 and 15 and 20 years.\xc2\xa0 That will be a topic of conversation I\xe2\x80\x99m sure at the dinner that the two Presidents will be having, again, in that very small setting on Tuesday evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs Secretary Clinton said today, we are going about this in a steady, careful, dynamic way.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in how to best pursue a positive, cooperative and contemplative relationship with China, pursuing our interests and pursing interests we think are in the interest of the globe on so-called cross-cutting issues.\xc2\xa0 That\'s basket one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBasket two would be the security and political issues.\xc2\xa0 And in that basket, we\xe2\x80\x99d -- I\xe2\x80\x99d cite three or four right now that have been areas that we have spent an enormous amount of time with the Chinese on during the course of this administration, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually made quite a bit of progress on, that have been in our interest and I think in the broader interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe first, North Korea, obviously, which is a key topic for the visit.\xc2\xa0 It has been obviously an important issue from the outset of this administration, very important in the last couple of months given the North Korea provocations that we talked about earlier in this discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have worked with the Chinese on various sanctions regimes around North Korea.\xc2\xa0 And very importantly in the last couple of months, we have worked -- and in the month of December very closely with the Chinese -- on encouraging the North Koreans to cease the provocations and to push back towards a diplomatic frame, especially conversation directly between the North and the South.\xc2\xa0 And we have had I think close cooperation frankly with the Chinese on that and in conjunction with our allies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe second is Iran and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely with the Chinese -- we worked very closely with the Chinese on the adoption of United Nations Security Council 1929, a comprehensive set of sanctions that have really I think in terms of their effect been -- I think have surprised some people.\xc2\xa0 These sanctions were carefully designed.\xc2\xa0 And again, working closely with the Chinese, we were able to have the United Nations Security Council resolution put in place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tA third area is Sudan.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a very important set of events this week beginning with the referendum that began on Sunday and runs through Saturday, right -- the 15th, yes.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese had referendum observers and we continue to talk to the Chinese about how to handle the events after the North-South referendum, including the implementation of the CPA.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the last one I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention, particularly in light of Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99 recent visit to China, our mil-mil -- military to military relations, which had been cut off in the fall of 2008.\xc2\xa0 The Chinese military, civilian -- the Chinese military and the United States military were not speaking to each other. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThis -- if you\'re trying to build a comprehensive relationship between two of the major powers in the world, that\'s not a situation that should be allowed to be sustained.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Gates made good progress on this, as he said, during his visit to China.\xc2\xa0 And we have reestablished those -- that conversation at the highest level, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with the Chinese towards establishing a more regular dialogue on mil-mil relations.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the security basket.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe third basket are the economic issues that Secretary Geithner talked about in his speech, and he mentioned to you all today.\xc2\xa0 Again, three or four aspects to that, as well.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the macroeconomic aspects, currency appreciation and rebalancing efforts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on bilaterally with the Chinese, but also in the context of multilateral organizations like the G20.\xc2\xa0 There are the whole -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole basket of access issues, business practice issues that Secretary Geithner talked about in his speech the other day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd then we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in commercial diplomacy, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And as Secretary Geithner said, probably the best statistic to think about the scale of the -- well, the expanding nature of the relationship with China is the export number.\xc2\xa0 And this year the Chinese are on track to export more than $100 billion of goods and services to China.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s set to expand pretty substantially over the next four or five years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd as Secretary Geithner said, our exports to China are growing at twice the rate of our exports to the rest of the world, underscoring the key point which is the economic relationship between the United States and China provides tremendous benefits to both countries -- third basket.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFourth basket are cross-cutting so called global issues of special concern.\xc2\xa0 Human rights would fall into that category.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton addressed that at some length today in her speech.\xc2\xa0 I think that two of my colleagues briefed you yesterday on the session that the President had with human rights and legal reform leaders focused on China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo with that, I wanted to give you all -- I apologize for taking so long -- but to give you all a sense of how we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about Asia generally and how we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about this visit specifically.\xc2\xa0 And I really appreciate your patience.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to take a couple of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Tom.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 To follow up on human rights, as you mentioned, Secretary Clinton talked about that strongly this morning.\xc2\xa0 But what does President Obama want to get out of this visit as it relates to that issue?\xc2\xa0 And when we hear that he\xe2\x80\x99s raised it in these meetings with President Hu, do you ever get the sense that progress is being made?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, two or three things.\xc2\xa0 Number one, the President does raise these issues regularly with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 The President stays well -- second, the President stays well informed about the dynamics around these issues in China, and indeed asked for a set of outside experts to come in yesterday, as we said.\xc2\xa0 Third, you saw the President speak out at the time that the Nobel Committee awarded Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Prize, and so speaking out publicly on these issues is also important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe believe that setting an example here is important too, frankly.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts to look very hard at our own legal regimes here, including banning torture and other practices, I think are very important in terms of setting an example.\xc2\xa0 And we pursue a number of dialogues with the Chinese on this subject.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a short game and a long game, Ben, that involves all those aspects.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other areas, like on the economy, Iran, North Korea, where issues are raised in private conversations, when you can sometimes track progress as a result.\xc2\xa0 Can you do that in human rights?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mixed picture.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we should do on that is have you talk to the folks who oversee our human rights dialogue.\xc2\xa0 Samantha Power here would be the best person to talk to about exactly the details of that dialogue and how they come back at agendas and track the progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just change subjects for one quick second, as long as we have you here, if we could get the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the events in Tunisia.\xc2\xa0 And also any sort of indication of what the thinking is when it comes to Lebanon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, two things.\xc2\xa0 One is, on Tunisia, I was told literally as I was walking in, that President Ben Ali -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported, at least -- is leaving the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. VIETOR:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve not confirmed that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Have not confirmed that -- okay.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen obviously the state media reporting that the President has dismissed the government and has called for legislative elections, and we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring these developments, Jake.\xc2\xa0 Obviously in this case we would condemn the ongoing violence in Tunisia, call upon the Tunisian authorities to fulfill the important commitments made by President Ben Ali in his speech yesterday to the Tunisian people, including respect for basic human rights in a process of much needed political reform.\xc2\xa0 And as President Obama said, each nation gives life to the principle of democracy in its own way, ground in the traditions of its own people, and those countries that respect the rights of their people are stronger and more successful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Lebanon, Prime Minister Assad -- Hariri was here, point one.\xc2\xa0 Point two is that the President expressed support for Prime Minister Hariri and his stand on behalf of the special tribunal and its work in pursuit of justice, in terms of bringing to justice those, finding the facts around the killing of his father in 2005.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNext is that we have been pretty deeply involved in diplomacy with key actors in the region and the French around trying to pull together an international group that can support the government of Lebanon as it works through these issues.\xc2\xa0 As you know, President Suleiman of Lebanon appointed Prime Minister Hariri the caretaker prime minister in Lebanon.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll serve in that role until a new government is formed.\xc2\xa0 They begin consultations on that new government on Monday.\xc2\xa0 And again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be supportive of a peaceful process going forward here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI would say one last thing, is that Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s intentions here with respect to finding the facts and justice have been really kind of laid bare.\xc2\xa0 And they will have a tough time, I think, continuing to articulate a narrative as a righteous resistance organization if they continue down a path towards undermining a government that is simply trying to support an international effort to find the truth and bring justice in the wake of a murder of a prominent member of that country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up, if you could comment on -- some of our allies in the region have questioned the decision to appoint an ambassador to Syria, seeing it as a reward for bad behavior -- if you could just comment on that light of recent events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, yes.\xc2\xa0 We see that -- we see the appointment of Robert Ford as the ambassador to Damascus as very much in our own interest.\xc2\xa0 And the reason is this, Jake:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s that every time that we want to have a direct conversation with the leadership of Syria, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to put together some special delegation to go do that.\xc2\xa0 That seems like more than it should be, frankly.\xc2\xa0 And we wanted to have an experienced, tough-minded diplomat, very experienced in the region, on site to be able to make our views known to the government of Syria on a range of issues of importance to the United States and the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so we do not see this as some sort of a reward to the Syrian government.\xc2\xa0 We rather see it as very much in the U.S. interest in terms of our ability to carry our diplomacy and to advance our interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner suggested that you might be able to address the issue of deliverables or concrete expectations from this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I would actually not want to get into a lot of speculation on that, Chip, except to say this -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs I said earlier in the conversation, we at the outset of the administration made a determination that we were going to engage not in kind of a summitry-oriented or summit-oriented, if you will, approach, but rather to have -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of me here now -- but a steady, intensive engagement with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And so that really doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lend itself to every time you meet having some sort of announcement of so-called deliverables.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat it does lend itself to, though, is identifying a set of issues that are important to both countries and continuing to work on them and to play the long haul on each of these things and to try to get real results over time, the kinds of results that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get in just kind of a once-every-six-months or once-every-year conversation between the two Presidents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat these events do do is they\xe2\x80\x99re action forcing.\xc2\xa0 They force the governments of each of the countries to identify the most important issues, bring them up here for discussion and in some cases resolution, or designing the next step to go forward here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I would focus more on our approach here, which is the not summitry, not kind of these -- that you have to have some deliverable with a dollar announced to it -- attached to it -- but rather trying to make progress on the issues like those I outlined in the four baskets that I laid out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was not the kind of staff work there was before the India visit, which was more like a -- which was really a summit, to have some kind of result at the end of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but the visit to India was a -- was the first visit by an American President to India since 2006, since March of 2006.\xc2\xa0 There was -- that was an effort there where we were really trying to make really kind of a step function increase in the quality of the relationship and had a different set -- it just had a different strategic dynamic to it.\xc2\xa0 Also, the -- three days there in India, again, trying to build out each of the aspects of the relationship.\xc2\xa0 It was a different project.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Chip, too, the commercial and economic relationship between those two countries is obviously fundamentally different and the investment that we saw in American companies represented a fairly decent-size leap in the type of economic relationship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the Indians in trying to put that on a bigger playing field in terms of its citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the President spoken with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask one more? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just last question.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that during the transition you undertook this project to see where we were under-involved and where we were over-involved.\xc2\xa0 Obviously under-involved was Asia.\xc2\xa0 Could you share with us where we were over-involved?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me rephrase my own comment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say where we needed to maybe change our emphasis or our approach, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say over-involved, but I would say that in fact the President said during the campaign and he said at the time he became President that we believe that we should draw down our troops in Iraq, and we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to do that, and to demilitarize that mission, if you will, to change the quality and approach and to move towards a more normal relationship with Iraq, if you will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow we have the opportunity, now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had their elections, they\xe2\x80\x99re forming the government, to do that, so that you would have -- you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of United States force we have in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 But that was one -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the most obvious example of kind of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would Europe be another example?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 No, as a matter -- Europe would not be another example on that.\xc2\xa0 And again, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said at the outset, another big thrust that we identified during the course of the campaign and in the transition was that alliances needed really to take -- we needed a close look at alliances and to increase the quality of those alliances, to identify important agendas for those.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d say both East and West, with respect to alliances, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIf you look at Europe, for example -- and the Lisbon summit I think is the best example of that -- we took issues that have been exceedingly contentious, and through a consultation process, working intensively with the Europeans over the course of over a year and a half, we moved to agreement on a missile defense system that would protect all of Europe, which had been a very contentious issue in Europe, and we got full endorsement of the -- formal endorsement by NATO of that system.\xc2\xa0 We had the Central Europeans, as I said earlier, those countries on the border with Russia endorsing that system.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe obviously had contentious debates again Afghanistan, and indeed, at that Lisbon summit, working with our allies, worked through an agreed-upon plan.\xc2\xa0 Same thing in Asia, to take a look at those key alliances in Asia and to work through our approach with them and, again, deepen the relationship with Japan, which we discussed earlier, with the Koreans and others and the other allies in Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s right with respect to Europe, and indeed, we had a whole -- we had a very specific set of goals with respect to Europe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I would just add to that, the European answer, I think if you look to it, the quality of those relationships throughout the continent were and have been tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 As Tom said, our mission in Afghanistan is an international mission; it\xe2\x80\x99s not just an American mission, though obviously we provide a -- the bulk of troops on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe quality of those relationships are important in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And I think, too, if you look at our ability to work with -- certainly throughout Europe and in Russia along with China in ensuring that the type of sanctions regime that we now have in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible two years ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe threat was certainly there, and the concept of tightening sanctions was the goal.\xc2\xa0 What was missing was the relationships in those countries and throughout the Security Council that would enable us to do that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s now come to fruition.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard officials throughout the government -- throughout our administration this week talk about the genuine practical impacts that those sanctions are having on many sectors in Iran.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you know, Chip, on that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a longer conversation -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll finish on this.\xc2\xa0 But the concept of alliances is a very important concept because you develop kind of habits of cooperation and a robust set of common threat assessments.\xc2\xa0 And we did our own analysis out of power and coming into power. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd for example, pushing aside an Article V, if you will, determination by NATO to assist in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 In our view, it was a mistake and we tried to go -- correct on that, to make this a more -- as Robert said exactly, a more alliance-driven process.\xc2\xa0 And indeed now, going beyond the alliance, right, to other partners in ISAF, 48 countries.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a longer conversation about coalitions of the willing versus alliances and the qualities that you get in terms of your diplomacy in alliances.\xc2\xa0 We did a lot of thinking about that and tried to act on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Tom, can I ask you about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Zardari of Pakistan today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the subject of North Waziristan come up?\xc2\xa0 And did President Obama press Mr. Zardari on when the Pakistani government is going to go in there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Has a readout been provided on the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Yes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was very detailed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seriously, that was not a readout.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was three sentences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThey met.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, good job, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yes, good first day on the job, Tommy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling supported up here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNo, seriously, it was a -- Helene, a couple of points on this.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this was not a full bilateral meeting between the United States and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We asked President Zardari to come over because he\xe2\x80\x99s here on a private visit to attend the memorial service at the Kennedy Center this afternoon for Ambassador Holbrooke.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo it was not a long meeting.\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t get into the details of those kinds of military or counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 They talked about the overall relationship, right, and the United States support for Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 They talked about the economic situation in Pakistan, and the joint work that we can do to advance economic stability in Pakistan, and which we are doing.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they talked about -- they talked about the blasphemy law, actually, towards the end of that discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he coming back to the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Zardari coming back to the White House --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have an alliance question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- can I please take the question again?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talking about alliances, you brought up the North Korea provocation last month a few times.\xc2\xa0 You talked about the close cooperation with China.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if China has done enough though, and what does President Obama want to hear from President Hu on North Korea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me tell you -- back that -- reel that back for just a couple minutes.\xc2\xa0 Our closest operational and policy cooperation on that project are with the South Koreans.\xc2\xa0 So this is the -- this is our ally.\xc2\xa0 We have, as I said -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the number wrong, but somewhere approaching 30,000 troops on the Korean peninsula.\xc2\xa0 We have thousands of American citizens in Seoul and throughout South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And we have a relationship that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been building on.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the principal cooperative mechanism.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNow to your question with respect to China, this has been an important strategic discussion between the United States and China.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton addressed this -- and Secretary Gates out in the region; I know you had a press event with Secretary Clinton at her speech today -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s been around the nature of the Korean regime and the nature of the threat, and what that requires the United States to do.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, we stand with our ally the South Koreans and with the Japanese.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we understand the Chinese focus on stability on the Korean peninsula.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with them, frankly, to broaden that analysis and to take into account the analysis that Secretary Clinton laid out in her speech today and Secretary Gates talked about, which is that on the path it\xe2\x80\x99s on right now, yes, the Koreans present a proliferation risk and they present a threat to the region, but they also are on a path to present a very important threat to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that analysis needs to be taken into account by the Chinese, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with them on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFrankly, I think that that discussion with the Chinese, which was had -- it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting -- was had quite directly prior to all these provocations during the Seoul meetings between President Obama and President Hu -- quite directly on that topic, and I had in private dinners in Asia during the course of November.\xc2\xa0 That analysis I think has led us to work more closely together, frankly, and I think led to, in part, Chinese efforts to lean on the North Koreans with respect to taking down the provocative acts and to advocate quite directly for talks between the North and the South.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And let me just -- before I go to April here -- yes, we hope that President Zardari will make a longer visit later in the year here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very important point.\xc2\xa0 Because when President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Excuse me.\xc2\xa0 But during the course of the discussion, the President obviously made that clear that he was glad that President Zardari would have the time to come over and have a short visit today because he was in town.\xc2\xa0 And we took advantage of that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 But the President obviously said to him that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be planning a more formal visit for President Zardari and the Pakistanis here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe also have the Pakistan-Afghan trilateral meeting here in February.\xc2\xa0 And we are planning for the next strategic dialogue with the Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me go to April and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Stephen real fast, and then Tom has got to get to Ambassador Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on China really fast, you talked about the Sudan.\xc2\xa0 But is there -- and then probably -- you didn\'t say it, but I was wondering if it could possibly come up in conversation or if there is a concern, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in conversation, the fact that China is not holding to its commitment and building infrastructure in certain countries in Africa as it deals to -- with taking its oil.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern with this administration on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 And the question is, are we concerned about China\xe2\x80\x99s overall approach in Africa?\xc2\xa0 Is that the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it relates to its oil, taking its oil.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not keeping its commitment, building infrastructure in exchange for oil.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to have a more specific conversation with you about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait -- you said -- but you are looking into that, or is the administration concerned about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- let me just -- I went through the principal issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be discussing in the security basket, and we obviously are concerned about stability and economic growth and the way that economic growth occurs in countries around the world, including in Africa.\xc2\xa0 But the principal security issues, though -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say there won\xe2\x80\x99t be others that could come up in the conversation, but the principal security issues are the ones that I laid out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be square with you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This will be likely President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s last visit, major visit to the U.S., in his current position.\xc2\xa0 What challenges do you think the handover of power are going to have for your relationship with the Chinese?\xc2\xa0 And also what challenge do you find from the current fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s more competing sort of centers of power in China now than -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to just talk to the leader.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of other influences on policy in relation to the U.S.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very good question and a complicated one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I mean, point one is this, is that President Hu Jintao is the President of China and is the -- and leads their leadership group and has proven to be in our experience a very good interlocutor and represents in our discussions the whole of government on every topic.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s -- I think that\'s the first and very important point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe leadership dynamics there, as you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s two years out in terms of -- about two years out in terms of their leadership changeover.\xc2\xa0 And our approach has been to work with this team on issues that are in front of us right now.\xc2\xa0 I do think, though, that we have the opportunity in this visit and in subsequent conversations to set the tone and the agenda for the next two years.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be trying to do during the course of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith respect to other voices, the third part of your question, that\'s a very interesting question, you know?\xc2\xa0 And there are -- again, our observation and our experience has been that President Hu and his team have been very straightforward interlocutors for the United States on behalf of their country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere are debates, though, that you see in China, particularly in the blogosphere and in newspapers in China about the Chinese approach to their rise and the Chinese approach to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And following that debate is a very important thing to do, right, and you see the vigor of it if you follow the discussions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say on that is the best evidence of the vigor of that discussion I think is in October People\xe2\x80\x99s Daily 13- or 14-page article by Dai Bingguo.\xc2\xa0 Dai Bingguo is the state councilor in China and is really the leading person on the security, foreign policy side.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it was a very interesting piece.\xc2\xa0 As I said, very lengthy.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you all to take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 And what it did is it kind of reasserted the peaceful rise approach.\xc2\xa0 It reasserted the Deng Xiaoping maxim of not having kind of a confrontational approach while China was engaged in economic development and pursuing its stability.\xc2\xa0 And I think it can read really as a definitive statement at this point of the leadership\xe2\x80\x99s approach to foreign policy generally and the United States specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou all have been great.\xc2\xa0 I really appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I apologize.\xc2\xa0 I could not resist at the top.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go back and read it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I read your blog.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the good news.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It gets a little snarky at times.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:09 P.M.
