ICT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us as we make our way from Burma to Cambodia.\xc2\xa0 I have joining me Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, who is here to give you an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings in Rangoon and other matters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be as quick as I can.\xc2\xa0 But the President just concluded a very, I think, exciting and consequential visit to Burma.\xc2\xa0 Just to run through, I think, some of the areas that we think are the most important steps that have been taken around the visit:\xc2\xa0 We welcome the Burmese government providing access to the International Committee of the Red Cross to prisoners.\xc2\xa0 We also welcome their decision to establish a process to adjudicate the remaining prisoners of conscience that we believe are being held within the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with them to provide names of people that we think should be a part of that process.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTheir decision to bring in the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will both help strengthen the monitoring capacity in the country and help build the capacity of Burma to deal with human rights issues.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve reiterated a commitment to pursue a ceasefire in Kachin State, which is the one remaining ethnic insurgency that they\xe2\x80\x99re confronting.\xc2\xa0 And with regards to the Rohingya in the Rakhine State, they reiterated their commitment to not just calm the situation, but to address the underlying issues including returning displaced people to their home and addressing the issue of citizenship for the Rohingya.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn nonproliferation, they came into the additional protocol of the IAEA, which submits them to additional safeguards and brings them into a nonproliferation regime that is important to the United States and the world.\xc2\xa0 And they came in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1874, which further commits them to end the military relationship with North Korea.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo go through the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings quickly, he began --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was all put down on paper ahead of time.\xc2\xa0 Did he talk about each of those things in the bilat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So getting to the bilats, every one of those issues actually came up in the bilateral meeting with President Thein Sein.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of notes of color:\xc2\xa0 At the beginning, the President commented to both President Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi how much the people and the landscape of the country reminded him of Jakarta and Indonesia as a child.\xc2\xa0 The President was struck by that, how similar it was as a setting.\xc2\xa0 Thein Sein also went out of his way not just to welcome the President, but also to note what he\xe2\x80\x99d learned about the President\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather spending time in the country during World War II.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn their bilateral meeting, they addressed all of the issues that I just went through.\xc2\xa0 The general message from President Obama was that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken bold steps that have set the country on a path to reform, but now they have to continue down that path so that it\xe2\x80\x99s irreversible, and that the more they do to demonstrate that they\xe2\x80\x99re implementing a reform agenda, the more we can do to assist them -- with our USAID mission that has begun again; with U.S. businesses and other international companies getting into the Burmese market; with military-to-military engagement to lift up the professionalism of the Burmese military.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo on a host of matters the President\xe2\x80\x99s core message was, the more you do to continue down the path of reform, the more we will be able to do to help bring greater economic development to your country and to help consolidate the democratic progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it was a very positive discussion atmospherically.\xc2\xa0 I think President Thein Sein went out of his way to signal his commitment to address issues like democracy and human rights.\xc2\xa0 He understood that the ethnic challenges that remain are fundamental to continuing the process of reform, and he very much signaled how much he wants the United States to be engaged within Burma going forward.\xc2\xa0 And we can get into any additional questions you have in a moment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith Aung San Suu Kyi, the President -- his opening message was simply how much he admires what she\xe2\x80\x99s done and that her, just as Thein Sein and the Burmese government\xe2\x80\x99s, decisions have helped begin a process of reform.\xc2\xa0 None of that would have been possible without the extraordinary sacrifices that Aung San Suu Kyi made over so many years.\xc2\xa0 And the President reiterated how much he believes that the reform process needs to include, as he said in his speech, clear checks and balances so the legislative branch that Aung San Suu Kyi is a part of, again, is a key player in the Burmese system and that they\xe2\x80\x99re addressing issues like constitutional reform, which are going to be necessary to consolidate the reform process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAung San Suu Kyi spoke about her work in the legislature, laws that she\xe2\x80\x99s introduced, including the law to reopen the university that the President spoke at today, but also, again, the need to continue moving forward with issues such as constitutional reform and a full transition to civilian control going forward -- or a completion of that transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those were the main issues discussed.\xc2\xa0 They obviously discussed the broader reform agenda as well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d note that the President was very pleased to see in Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s house -- he had enjoyed introducing her to Bo, and he was very pleased to see that the stuffed Bo that we gave her was displayed in the -- where she was, in the room where the meeting was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Aung San Suu Kyi talked about the full transition to civilian control?\xc2\xa0 Did he talk about that with the president?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And what I mean by that, to be clear, is there\xe2\x80\x99s been a transition to civilian leadership, but they\xe2\x80\x99re on a path to an election in 2015, and so that as a part of that transition they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be addressing how to make sure that\xe2\x80\x99s a free and fair election, what amendments need to be considered for the constitution as they look to consolidate their democracy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, they\xe2\x80\x99ve transitioned to civilian leadership, yet this needs to -- for that to be irreversible they need to make sure that the types of reforms that they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun are consolidated within the political system.\xc2\xa0 So that was the gist of it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe discussed both -- a similar set of issues with both leaders.\xc2\xa0 Again, the reforms that have been taken, the reforms that need to be done on issues like rule of law, ethic -- the need for national reconciliation, the -- again, the -- and then the role the U.S. can play in supporting Burmese development going forward with the easing of our sanctions, with the USAID mission, and with our increased diplomatic engagement with the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBefore I take questions I just want to give you an update on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing on Gaza, because I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been some interest in that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, basically the President has been updated regularly by both Tom Donilon and Secretary Clinton, who are traveling with him.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton has spoken to a number of world leaders in the last couple of days.\xc2\xa0 She spoke to the French foreign minister and to Bank Ki-moon before they went to the region.\xc2\xa0 She spoke to the Egyptian prime minister after he left Gaza.\xc2\xa0 And she spoke to both the Qatari and the Turkish foreign ministers.\xc2\xa0 So she is speaking to those nations in the region and those leaders who are going to the region about our efforts to achieve a de-escalation of the conflict that includes an end to rocket fire from Gaza.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn addition to that, Tom Donilon has spoken to the Israeli national security advisor on a more-than-daily basis.\xc2\xa0 And then both Secretary Clinton and Tom Donilon have been speaking to our ambassadors in Israel and Egypt.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Secretary Clinton and Tom Donilon had a conference call with our ambassador in Israel on the flight into Burma.\xc2\xa0 And then at lunch, at the embassy, Tom Donilon and Secretary Clinton briefed the President on their discussions on Gaza.\xc2\xa0 So Tom provided an update in the morning, and then at the embassy, Secretary Clinton and Tom were able to give him an additional update.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President reached out to any foreign leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He has not yet today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if he does later tonight or tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s already?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not yet reached out to any -- the President has not spoken to any foreign leaders today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated if he does.\xc2\xa0 Again, basically Secretary Clinton is speaking to a number of her counterparts, Tom is as well, and then our ambassadors in Egypt and Israel have been in frequent contact with both of them and they\xe2\x80\x99re able to update the President on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. strategy in all these discussions?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what points are you making?\xc2\xa0 What are you trying to get each side to do?\xc2\xa0 And how are you doing that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what -- our position continues to be that those nations in the region, particularly nations that have influence over Hamas, and that\xe2\x80\x99s principally Egypt and Turkey, also Qatar -- as I said, the Secretary spoke to the Qatari prime minister -- that those nations need to use that influence to de-escalate the conflict.\xc2\xa0 And de-escalation has to begin with, again, an end to rocket fire from Gaza.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are also speaking to the Israelis on a regular basis to update them about our contacts with these various countries.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis are having their own conversations I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\xc2\xa0 But the general goal here is de-escalation, because as the President said -- as you heard him in the press conference say, Israel has a right to defend itself.\xc2\xa0 The best way to make sure that Israel is secure and the situation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t escalate is for there to be a peaceful resolution and de-escalation rather than a military -- a continued military conflict.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, you\xe2\x80\x99ve touched on this a little bit, but did the President have any sort of impressions or kind of reaction to just the scene, all the people lining the streets, waving flags?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The President was very moved by the outpouring of people lining the streets.\xc2\xa0 Actually I should have added, too, that the President -- we had originally not thought we had enough time to go to Shwedagon.\xc2\xa0 And the President basically decided in the motorcade to the first meeting with Thein Sein that he was going to go to Shwedagon no matter whether there was time or not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we were going to the airport -- to the parliament?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, because of the beauty of the site and the importance of it to the Burmese people.\xc2\xa0 But I think he was struck by the reception he received.\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99d say, look, in each meeting, the leaders could not have been more positive and gracious.\xc2\xa0 And President Thein Sein went out of his way; multiple times in the meeting he used the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign slogan.\xc2\xa0 You heard him do it in his public comments, but he did -- multiple times in the bilat he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to do what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, I want to move forward.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there an exclamation point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think there was an exclamation point.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of with these -- with the reforms that he\xe2\x80\x99s launched -- and he knew the issues we were interested in and was ready to make commitments to move forward on them, understanding that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to follow through and that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard work in the follow-through.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think he was struck by the welcome he received from the people.\xc2\xa0 He had a very positive meeting with the president in terms of the warmth with which he was received.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen, with Aung San Suu Kyi, he commented about how moving it was to visit her in her home where she had previously been imprisoned, and now to visit her as a member of parliament is a remarkable testament to her and also to the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you meet with Aung San Suu Kyi in her home, you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting around a very small, round table, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very intimate, and they were able to have a very free-flowing discussion.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the point that she made to him is that she\xe2\x80\x99s now a political figure in the country, and she\xe2\x80\x99s been a symbol and a leader of a movement, but she\xe2\x80\x99s also now a member of parliament.\xc2\xa0 And so they discussed things on her agenda, like how can they create better opportunity for the Burmese people; how can they expand access to education and health care; again, how can we move forward with reforms to the constitution and laws that, again, make the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s taken place irreversible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President then, I think, at the speech site, was able to have this clutch, this brief meeting backstage with a number of people who have made extraordinary sacrifices -- the leader of the Saffron Revolution, political prisoners who have been released after many years in jail, representatives of ethnic minorities.\xc2\xa0 And the President commented how struck he was by the sacrifices that these people had made and the perspective that gives you about, well, all the challenges that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with.\xc2\xa0 In some respects, these people have made extraordinary sacrifices in their own lives that are an inspiration to him as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when he left he said -- he commented on how much he\xe2\x80\x99d like to -- again, would have liked to have spent even more time in this country if he could.\xc2\xa0 So I think all in all he was quite moved by the day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was his decision to go to the temple related to his reaction of seeing the people on the streets?\xc2\xa0 You said them together, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure whether those two were related.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think he actually saw the temple as we flew in and was discussing with us how important it was to this country as a symbol of national unity and something that they\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of.\xc2\xa0 And he just felt it was important to make sure that we took the time to do that, again, to send a signal of both respect for the culture of the country and also to be able to take in a remarkable site.\xc2\xa0 And he very much enjoyed it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he say?\xc2\xa0 Did he say anything afterwards, like dousing the flames of anger, hatred?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Aung San Suu Kyi made sure that he poured water on his birthday.\xc2\xa0 And she asked him what day of the week it was, and he said Friday.\xc2\xa0 And she said, well, make sure you did it on a Friday, and he said yes, I did.\xc2\xa0 And he described to her how he hit the gong and had gone through this very moving --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he hit the gong today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Let me check that actually.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xc2\xa0 You guys were closer to it than I was.\xc2\xa0 But he was describing the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut so, again, I think that given the importance of it to this country, he felt it was important to go to the site.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Thein Sein meeting he referenced Myanmar instead of Burma.\xc2\xa0 Was that just a slipup or is it kind of a sign that you guys are sort of easing your references to the name?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The President felt that given the fact that -- the government obviously goes by Myanmar; it\xe2\x80\x99s still a disputed issue.\xc2\xa0 The United States government position is still Burma.\xc2\xa0 Aung San Suu Kyi still refers to Burma.\xc2\xa0 But then in his meeting with Thein Sein and his comment that he would refer to Myanmar, that that was a diplomatic courtesy to do, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that the U.S. government position is still Burma.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve said we recognize that different people call this country by different names, and we obviously accept that.\xc2\xa0 We certainly accept that that\xe2\x80\x99s the view of President Thein Sein.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our view is that this is something we can continue to discuss moving forward, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a symbol of how this country, again, is working through issues that in the past stood in the way of progress but now can be addressed through dialogue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he just decide that on the spot?\xc2\xa0 Because the guidance we had gotten ahead of time was that he was likely not to use either name.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that was in reference to the speech when you asked me that question.\xc2\xa0 No, I think in diplomatic meetings, it is often customary that when you\xe2\x80\x99re meeting with certain government officials you use Myanmar; when you\xe2\x80\x99re meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi and others who use Burma, you use Burma.\xc2\xa0 So I think within the meeting it was the diplomatic practice to use Myanmar, and then he used it in his public comment, and then --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the historical analogies for that, when you had -- what does that diplomatic custom derive from?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, it derives from the -- well, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m only speaking uniquely to this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 This is what our diplomats do.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, is there some historical example?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I was referring to that that\xe2\x80\x99s basically the practice of our diplomats in Burma.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:50 P.M.\xc2\xa0 ICT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
