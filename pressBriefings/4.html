Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t1:37 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I do not have any comments at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. \xc2\xa0Kevin, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0So what is the White House reaction to Donald Trump encouraging Vladimir Putin to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, I\'m periodically asked about the controversial comments uttered by the Republican nominee for President, and I don\'t make a habit of responding. \xc2\xa0What I can just make clear in this case is what the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this issue is, and it\'s a pretty simple, common-sense one. \xc2\xa0The United States counters cyber threats targeting all Americans regardless of which political party they belong to. \xc2\xa0And that\'s consistent with the national security approach that\'s been taken by Democratic and Republican Presidents for virtually our nation\xe2\x80\x99s entire history.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of concern about his comments, though. \xc2\xa0I guess my question is if you think that\'s overblown.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, particularly now, and particularly this week, there\xe2\x80\x99s active political debate about the claims and rhetoric that are used by candidates on both sides. \xc2\xa0And I\'ll let others do that. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to our national security, and when it comes to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approach to national security, we\'re going to do everything we can to protect the American people without regard to which political party they belong to or who they voted for in the last election. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Harry Reid today came out and said that intelligence agencies should withhold briefings for Donald Trump, in part as a result of his comments. \xc2\xa0Is that something that the White House thinks should be done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has made clear that ensuring a smooth transition to the next President is a top priority, and it\'s certainly one of his top priorities for his last six months in office. \xc2\xa0And that requires a lot of advance preparation. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you that White House staff and agency staff all across the federal government are already working on the steps and procedures related to ensuring a smooth transition from one President to another. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s important, in part because of the significant threats around the world. \xc2\xa0For more than 60 years now, the intelligence community has offered briefings to the presidential nominees of the two major political parties in an effort to facilitate a smooth transition. \xc2\xa0Again, in the same way that the Obama administration isn\'t going to start planning for the transition after the election, we\'re going to take steps in advance, the intelligence community is going to do the same thing in terms of preparing the potential next President. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re doing that based on a tradition that\'s been in place for more than 60 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the Director of National Intelligence has indicated he intends to conduct those briefings pursuant to that longstanding tradition, and he certainly is supported by this administration and this White House in doing so. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s also true of the intelligence community is they understand what steps are necessary to protect sensitive national security information. \xc2\xa0And the administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major party presidential candidates while also protecting sensitive national security information.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one other thing that I\'ll clarify, just to make sure that everybody understands this, is Director Clapper has also publicly indicated that his expectation is to provide the same information to both nominees. \xc2\xa0And that certainly seems appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Russia said today that the U.S. needs to handle this hacking issue on its own, responding to both comments by Donald Trump and others. \xc2\xa0Has there been any diplomatic exchange about this between Russia and the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me take that in a couple different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is I want to be careful of trying to answer these questions that we\'re all cognizant of the fact that there is an ongoing FBI investigation into the cyber breach at the DNC, and so I\'m going to be as circumspect as I can out of a desire to protect the integrity of that ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0I just don\'t want to say anything that could be perceived even as having some kind of influence over the course of that investigation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat investigation, as always, is being led by the investigators who will follow the facts, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll do so without regard to politics. \xc2\xa0I think the political sensitivities here are obvious, and that\'s why I\'m trying to go to great lengths here to make clear exactly how this is being handled.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo separate from that, so the reason I\'m making that point right now is that the FBI has not revealed any information about who may have perpetrated the cyber intrusion at the DNC. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of speculation out there. \xc2\xa0I recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s been an analysis done that has indicated that the Russians are likely to blame, but that is not a conclusion that the FBI has chosen to publicize at this point. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re conducting an ongoing investigation, and so I\'ll let them speak to whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ve made such a determination, and I\'ll let them speak to whether they believe it\'s appropriate to go public with such a determination.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat all said, I do understand that Secretary of State Kerry indicated, after his meeting with his Russian counterpart, that he had raised cybersecurity issues with Mr. Lavrov. \xc2\xa0That certainly is not the first time that senior-level U.S. government officials have raised significant concerns about Russian activities in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0In fact, just yesterday -- I believe it was yesterday, maybe it was two days ago -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s top homeland security advisor, Lisa Monaco, gave a speech at the International Conference on Cybersecurity up in New York, and in that speech, she noted \xe2\x80\x9cThe global landscape is increasingly diverse and dangerous. \xc2\xa0Nations like Russia and China are growing more assertive and sophisticated in their cyber operations.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMike Rogers, who is the Director of the NSA and the Commander of Cyber Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. \xc2\xa0He said \xe2\x80\x9cRussia has very capable cyber operators who can and do work with speed, precision and stealth. \xc2\xa0Russia is also home to a substantial segment of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most sophisticated cyber criminals who have found victims all over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard similar comments -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll spare you the quotes for now, at least -- from Director Clapper, Secretary Carter, and other senior U.S. officials.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason I cited those quotes, Jeff -- and we can go through other -- do more of them if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary -- to make clear that the Obama administration has been mindful of the cyber threat emanating from Russia for quite some time. \xc2\xa0And that threat takes a variety of forms. \xc2\xa0In some cases, as the Director of the NSA indicated, there are actors that are both affiliated with the state, and some actors that are affiliated with criminal organizations, and occasionally, those two actors will have different motives in conducting their operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn all cases, the Obama administration and the United States government is committed to countering those threats, whether they emanate from Russia or anywhere else. \xc2\xa0And we will do so to protect all of the American people without regard to the political party that they support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it is safe to conclude that Russia and the United States have had diplomatic exchanges about this hacking topic, with both regard to what the Republican nominee has said about it and with regard to the investigation related to the DNC?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the conversation that Secretary Kerry had with his counterpart. \xc2\xa0I do know that within the course of that conversation Secretary Kerry did something that he did not do for the first time, which is raise concerns with his Russian counterpart about some of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak with any more specificity than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd those are messages that we\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered both in private and in public in the past. \xc2\xa0And I gave you a couple of examples of the public expressions of concern we have about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activity in cyberspace and the potential threat it poses to U.S. citizens and U.S. national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Briefly, on one other topic, China said today it will hold routine naval exercises in the South China Sea with Russia in September. \xc2\xa0Is the United States convinced that those are routine? \xc2\xa0And is that announcement generally a concern, or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight into what sort of exercises they\xe2\x80\x99re planning. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that the United States conducted some exercises with Chinese military officials and Chinese military forces in the Pacific earlier this year. \xc2\xa0Just last week, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Richardson, was in China interacting with his counterparts and even touring some Chinese military facilities in China. \xc2\xa0So that kind of military-to-military relationship is not just one that exists between China and Russia, it\xe2\x80\x99s also a relationship that exists between the U.S. military and the Chinese military.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what exercises they are planning, but in the same way that the United States and China have a military-to-military relationship, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised to hear that Russia and China are seeking to build on their military-to-military relationship, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is the South China Sea, which is a disputed --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that this is a region of the world that is a sensitive diplomatic topic right now. \xc2\xa0But again, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the nature of the military-to-military relationship that the United States and China have. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Chinese and Russian officials speak to the nature of their military-to-military relationship, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly new development.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask first about the reported split between al Nusra and al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a move that seems designed to sort of embed al Nusra more with the broader Syrian insurgency. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern that doing so risks al Nusra, through their influence, radicalizing more moderate Sunni insurgent groups; it\xe2\x80\x99s going to complicate our ongoing talks with Russia about a political transition in Syria; and how, or what our plans are to distinguish al Nusra from sort of the other insurgency groups that we\xe2\x80\x99ve sought to protect to some extent.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Justin, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering from the beginning that it\xe2\x80\x99s a direct result of Bashar al Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership that extremist organizations have sought a safe haven inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Extremist organizations like al Nusra, like ISIL and others, seek to take root amid the chaos. \xc2\xa0And that is deeply destabilizing, as we saw with ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s advance over the border with Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen that it poses a real national security risk to the United States and our allies. \xc2\xa0And our allies in Europe have been targeted and innocent people have been killed by individuals who traveled to Iraq and in Syria, got training, equipment, support, and then traveled back to the West and carried out terrorist attacks, killing innocent people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is that the extremist threat that exists inside of Syria is one that is serious and concerning to the United States and to our allies. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a robust response on the part of the Obama administration, building a coalition of about 67 countries and entities to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not just ISIL that we\'ve been focused on. \xc2\xa0On the very first day that President Obama, in late summer of 2014, authorized military action inside of Syria, U.S. military fighter pilots also hit extremist targets not affiliated directly with ISIL. \xc2\xa0So we\'ve been mindful of the extremist threat in Syria literally since the first day of our military operations there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat all said, you will be surprised to hear me express some skepticism about the claims that you just cited. \xc2\xa0The United States continues to asses that Nusra Front leaders maintain the intent to conduct eventual attacks in and against the West and there continues to be increasing concern about Nusra Front\xe2\x80\x99s growing capacity for external operations that could threaten both the United States and Europe. \xc2\xa0So President Obama and the rest of the Obama administration and our military actions have been focused on and directed against a variety of extremist groups inside of Syria, including both ISIL and the Nusra Front.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess the question is more if -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised the United States will continue to distinguish between al Nusra and other opposition groups. \xc2\xa0But as they\'re clouding the picture on the ground in Syria, is there a concern among the administration that that will complicate our efforts either to negotiate a sort of political solution, or to win the hearts and minds of the Syrian people as we\'re trying to garner that if our attacks on al Nusra are seen as in a way bolstering the Assad regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, what I think is true is that you\'re accurately citing some of the complexities on the ground as it relates to the security situation and the political situation inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0I think what I would say is those complexities aren\xe2\x80\x99t significantly changed by this newly issued public denial from leaders of the Nusra Front.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about something else. \xc2\xa0Kind of buried in Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s press conference yesterday, he said that he\xe2\x80\x99d look at the possibility of recognizing Crimea as Russian and at the possibility of lifting sanctions against Moscow. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering both if you have a reaction to that, but also if you\'ve heard any alarm from U.S. allies that obviously faced tough domestic policies to keep those sanctions in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been informed of any diplomatic communications in response to that political rhetoric. \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let -- there are plenty of others, particularly this week, who are on duty responding to controversial comments uttered by the Republican presidential nominee, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let others handle that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut with regard to the policy of the Obama administration, since early 2014, the United States and the rest of the international community has been deeply concerned about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s flagrant violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including by attempting to annex Crimea. \xc2\xa0That is an action that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just not recognized by the international community, it actually prompted an aggressive response from the international community in the form of well-coordinated and integrated sanctions that have placed economic pressure on Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are also sanctions that have been targeted by the United States Treasury Department against certain entities -- Russian entities operating in Crimea and other Crimean entities that were complicit. \xc2\xa0So the United States has been very direct about our view that the attempted annexation of Crimea by Russia is a flagrant violation, an egregious violation, of international norms. \xc2\xa0And it\'s not a violation that the United States is prepared to tolerate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also, by the way, is not an international violation that most of Europe is prepared to tolerate. \xc2\xa0And that is why you\'ve seen the United States and Europe be able to coordinate so effectively to impose sanctions against Russia, to impose costs against them for this action. \xc2\xa0And the international commitment to that principle is rock solid. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was some doubt early on, you\'ll recall, that once these sanctions were put in place -- the biggest bulk of which, the most far-reaching of which were imposed in the fall of 2014 \xc2\xa0-- there was a lot of doubt about whether or not the United States would be able to maintain political support among the Europeans for keeping those sanctions in place. \xc2\xa0But yet that\'s exactly what we\'ve done almost two years later. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s an indication not just of the skillful diplomacy of the Obama administration and the State Department, it also is an indication that European leaders share some deep concern about Russia\'s actions inside of Ukraine, including the attempted annexation of Crimea.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last quick one on Russia, as well. \xc2\xa0Vice President Biden described Vladimir Putin as a dictator last night in the speech. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if that\'s the administration\'s policy towards the Russians.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I can tell you is that there is a -- first of all, there is no official government designation about dictatorships, but there was included in the State Department Human Rights report a description of the political situation inside of Russia, with regard to the Russian government. \xc2\xa0And so I\'ll just read from it: \xc2\xa0"The Russian Federation has a highly centralized authoritarian political system dominated by President Vladimir Putin." \xc2\xa0That\'s a direct quote. \xc2\xa0It went on to say that Russia\'s institutions "lacked independence from the executive branch."</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the official language that\'s used by the U.S. government to describe the system of government that is currently in place in Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then I guess just to put a finer point on it -- does President Obama believe that Vladimir Putin is a dictator?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think you\'d be hard-pressed to draw a distinction between the word that Vice President Biden used and the language that was included in the State Department report.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Looking ahead to September, when Congress returns, what would the White House like for Congress to do first? What needs to be done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are so many things that they left town --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How do you categorize it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, maybe, I guess, first I would say that they left a day early, and maybe they\'ll come back a day early. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see. \xc2\xa0There\'s plenty of work to be done. \xc2\xa0I think the President has made clear what some of his priorities are, and I think if we saw forward movement on any of them in that first day that they\'re back, we would welcome that sign of progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first thing that comes to mind, of course, is Zika. \xc2\xa0Five months ago, the Obama administration sent up to Congress a specific proposal at the request of our public health professionals about outlining the resources that they need to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0And Republicans in Congress have not succeeded in passing legislation to do that. \xc2\xa0And that means that our public health professionals both at the federal government but also at the state and local level are not getting the support that they need to do everything possible to fight the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is quite concerned about this situation. \xc2\xa0The President, earlier this week, had a telephone conversation with the Governor of Florida. \xc2\xa0Based on public reports, there are now four suspected cases of non-travel-related Zika transmission. \xc2\xa0And that\'s concerning because of the threat that that virus poses to pregnant women and newborn children. \xc2\xa0So congressional action on that would certainly be welcomed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the Obama administration has also been pressing Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that actually includes funding to fight opioid addiction. \xc2\xa0There\'s been a lot of talk from Republicans about this being a priority. \xc2\xa0We haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually seen Republicans do anything significant when it comes to providing resources that are necessary to expand treatment options for the thousands of Americans who are fighting an opioid addition.</p>\n<p>\n\tCriminal justice reform; approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0There are a wide variety of priorities, but I guess progress on any of those four on the first day would be welcomed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also, just the regular annual appropriations bills are still standing. \xc2\xa0So do you see September as sort of a money battle with Congress?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I suspect it\'s going to be a dysfunction battle if the first eight months of this year is any indication. \xc2\xa0Republicans in Congress promised that if they were given the opportunity to run the United States Congress that they would get Congress moving again. \xc2\xa0And that was the subject of an op-ed that was penned by the Senate Majority Leader on the day after the last midterm elections. \xc2\xa0And as you point out, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t passed the budget bills yet this year through both houses of Congress. \xc2\xa0And there are a whole bunch of legislative priorities, some of which I mentioned, that should be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together, but the truth is, right now Republicans can\'t even work together among themselves to make progress on these priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know what September holds. \xc2\xa0But the pressure will certainly be on Republicans who worked hard and campaigned hard for the responsibility of running the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0Thus far, they\'ve failed to perform that duty very effectively. \xc2\xa0And in expressing that view, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\'s the minority opinion when you consider that the approval rating of Congress right now is in the teens.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You\'d mentioned pressure -- there may be a great deal of pressure tonight on Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0She\'s up to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah? \xc2\xa0You think? \xc2\xa0Because I think it would be fair to say that the First Lady and the President both hit homeruns. \xc2\xa0I would say the pressure is on. \xc2\xa0Do you expect she\'ll hit a homerun? \xc2\xa0And what do you think she\'ll touch on tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed about her speech, so I\'d refer you to her campaign to talk to you about the kinds of things that she\xe2\x80\x99ll prioritize in I think what everybody would acknowledge is an important opportunity for any candidate when you\xe2\x80\x99re speaking to a live television primetime audience.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will you be satisfied with a double?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think both Mrs. Obama and President Obama made a forceful case for why they believe -- why they\xe2\x80\x99re strongly supporting Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, and that\xe2\x80\x99s based on their knowledge of what\xe2\x80\x99s required of the job of President, but also based on their personal knowledge of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s character. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I would expect the President to watch the speech tonight. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99ll do so with a lot of confidence in the candidate that he\xe2\x80\x99s endorsed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about Gitmo. \xc2\xa0I know on occasion we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an update on the number. \xc2\xa0Do you have anything to announce in terms of more detainees being moved, as we get ever closer to the President\xe2\x80\x99s summer break?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did get an updated count here. \xc2\xa0Again, the detainee population at Gitmo is 76, 32 that have been approved for transfer that are awaiting transfer at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates in terms of potential transfers that may be upcoming, but once those transfers have taken place, we\xe2\x80\x99ll announce them publicly so that you can certainly be aware of the steps that we continue to take to reduce the population of the prison at Guantanamo Bay in the hopes of eventually closing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I could, I want to draw your attention the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the war on terror, broadly speaking. \xc2\xa0He said as a matter of fact that \xe2\x80\x9cthe world is at war,\xe2\x80\x9d but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a war of religions. \xc2\xa0Does the President share his viewpoint? And what\xe2\x80\x99s his reaction to what the Pope had to say in the wake of the latest terror attacks in Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I was just going to mention that, Kevin. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the American people and everybody here at the White House offers our profound condolences to loved ones of the Catholic priest that was killed by apparent ISIL sympathizers in France earlier this week. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a tragedy. \xc2\xa0And I know that Pope Francis is mourning the loss of that Catholic priest, and the rest of us are, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore generally, I will acknowledge I did not see the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s comments before I came out here. \xc2\xa0But based on what you have relayed, it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s quite consistent with the position of the Obama administration and what President Obama himself has articulated, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s a fantasy for ISIL to suggest that they represent Islam in a fight against the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is ISIL has declared war against the rest of the world, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t represent Islam. \xc2\xa0They represent a perverted, nihilistic world view that promises nothing but chaos and violence. \xc2\xa0And President Obama, I think like Pope Francis, continues to be confident that while that threat needs to be taken seriously, that the rest of the world, including the Muslim world, will prevail over the deeply dark, violent vision that\xe2\x80\x99s put forward by ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tDevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, Josh. \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0A couple questions about the speech last night. \xc2\xa0One, I wanted to ask you about one line from the President. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who threatens our values with their fascist, communist, jihadist, or homegrown demagogues will always fail in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Great line.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Interesting line. \xc2\xa0When he was talking about demagogues, was he referring to Donald Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that as I was listening to the speech, it seemed clear to me that each of the categories that the President was describing, that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one person in mind. \xc2\xa0The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one jihadi in mind; the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one fascist in mind; the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one domestic demagogue in mind. \xc2\xa0The President was talking about how, over the course of our country\xe2\x80\x99s history, by adhering to our core American values, we\xe2\x80\x99ve overcome threats emanating from individuals and organizations that could be aptly described using that criteria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He has referred to Mr. Trump as a demagogue before. \xc2\xa0He believes that Trump is a demagogue or can be a demagogue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you could do a Google search to see if the President has used that word directly in response to Mr. Trump. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s done that before or not. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that he has.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat portion of the speech was focused on the kinds of values that our country has pursued and sought to advance throughout our history. \xc2\xa0And our steadfast commitment to those values has served our country and our people quite well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, the President ended his speech, I thought, in a way that was really powerful in terms of talking about the values of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s family in Kansas. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a small-town community, El Dorado -- a place I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to before, actually, not too far away from Kansas City. \xc2\xa0But this is typical of small towns all across the country that prioritize and value people who are humble, people who are kind, people who are generous, people who are honest, people who are unselfish. \xc2\xa0And those are the kinds of values that are rooted not just in the small towns in Kansas, though they certainly are. \xc2\xa0But those values transcend region. \xc2\xa0Those values transcend faith. \xc2\xa0Those values transcend political party. \xc2\xa0Those values transcend generations. \xc2\xa0Generations of Americans have been committed to those values. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s served our country really well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is the kind of rhetoric that the President used in his very first convention speech in 2004, and that\xe2\x80\x99s got a deep resonance today. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s in some ways -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for you all to ask a legitimate question in here about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of a divided America. \xc2\xa0And that passage of the speech, that four or five paragraphs near the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the most effective rebuttal of that question I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard. \xc2\xa0And it certainly does reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s deeply held view. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s one that -- frankly, this is a view that he had before he was elected President, before he ran for President. \xc2\xa0And the fact that he is as committed to those values as ever, and the way that he sees the American people be committed to those values, is what gives him such strong optimism about the future of our country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does he think Donald Trump threatens those values?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there certainly are some rhetoric that we\'ve heard on the other side of the aisle that contradicts those values. \xc2\xa0There is no denying that. \xc2\xa0But again, that\'s something that other people will have to decide in terms of whether or not that influences their decision in November.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more, quick follow. \xc2\xa0I was in touch with a number of servicemembers last night during the speech, a couple who are in theater, several who are here. \xc2\xa0And one of things that struck them was that the President did not mention -- as he has in all of his previous DNC speeches -- the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and troops who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way right now. \xc2\xa0And I was wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any kind of reason why the President didn\'t specifically mention those wars and the troops, aside from the fight against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, Devin, I think the President certainly did talk about how disappointed he was to hear rhetoric on the other side of the aisle that describes the United States military as a disaster. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President described the United States military and the men and women who serve in it as the greatest fighting force the world has ever known. \xc2\xa0That was included in his speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President was introduced to the stage yesterday, last night, by a woman whose son served and gave his life for the United States in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0 And she told I thought a pretty powerful story about the way that the President has honored her son\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice and her family\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice for the country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think speeches to a political convention are a little different than speeches, for example in the context of a State of the Union, where there\xe2\x80\x99s a set of issues that has to be covered. But I think the President made clear his deep appreciation for the service of our men and women in uniform who are serving our country all around the world, including right now in Iraq and Afghanistan, to keep us safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tChip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thank you. \xc2\xa0On that same line, \xe2\x80\x9cfascists, communists, jihadists, and homegrown demagogues.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You liked that line, too? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It certainly did stick out. \xc2\xa0I would venture to guess that probably about everybody who heard that speech --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s part of what made it so great.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- when he said \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown demagogues\xe2\x80\x9d thought of Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0So even if you\'re right that he was not referring to one individual, he was certainly grooving Donald Trump into that group of homegrown demagogues. \xc2\xa0You would concede that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would concede that most of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech was not geared toward subtlety. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I think the American people --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that as a yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the American people understood quite directly the argument that the President was making. \xc2\xa0And the argument that he was making did not have -- particularly in that line -- did not have one single person in mind, but rather was talking about the kinds of values that generations of Americans have subscribed to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He certainly put Donald Trump in the minds of the people who were listening. \xc2\xa0And he had to know he was going to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that the President was trying to be subtle. \xc2\xa0I think the President was quite direct in the argument that he was making.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But my question is, if Donald Trump was one of the \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown demagogues\xe2\x80\x9d he was referring to there, I know he doesn\'t think much about Donald Trump, but is it fair to group him with \xe2\x80\x9cfascists, communists, and jihadists\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what is fair is that the kinds of values that generations of Americans have been committed to and fought and died for have served our country quite well. \xc2\xa0It is the reason that people all around the world look to the United States as a beacon of freedom. \xc2\xa0It is the reason that people from all around the world travel to the United States. \xc2\xa0They desire to be a part of our country. \xc2\xa0They desire to be citizens of our country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that that diverse population signs up to serve this country in the military. \xc2\xa0And those values are what allowed the United States, for example, to defeat fascism in World War II.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are the kinds of values that we have followed even as we have overcome the threat from terrorism. \xc2\xa0And it requires vigilance. \xc2\xa0It also requires a firm commitment to those same values, again, that transcend faith, that transcend region, that transcend generations, that transcend party. \xc2\xa0And it speaks to the unique character of the United States and the people who live here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one other. \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on Justin\xe2\x80\x99s question about Crimea. \xc2\xa0You\'ve covered the global politics of that issue pretty well. \xc2\xa0But what does the President think -- or if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to the President -- what does the White House think about the fact that a possible future President of the United States would say that maybe we should lift the sanctions, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking into it; and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking into allowing -- recognizing Crimea as Russian territory?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not spoken to the President about it, but I know the President believes that in order to counter Russia\xe2\x80\x99s flagrant violation of Ukraine sovereignty, we need to preserve and present a united front. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd at each step in mobilizing the international community to respond to this situation, President Obama has worked closely with our allies in Europe to ensure, for example, that in diplomatic exchanges with Russia about the situation in Ukraine, that the international community is on the same page. \xc2\xa0Obviously, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande have played a prominent role in all of that, in the context of the Normandy Group discussions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also clear is that as the international community has pursued sanctions to impose costs on Russia for violating Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty that that\'s required effective coordination in the international community, as well. \xc2\xa0The point that we\'ve made on a number of occasions is that the United States -- even if those sanctions were in place -- doesn\'t do a whole lot of business directly with Russia when you compare it to the economic ties between Germany and Russia, or Italy and Russia, or even France and Russia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking, is it acceptable for a presidential candidate to say what Donald Trump said about Crimea? \xc2\xa0Is it acceptable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at, Chip, is I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to respond directly to his comments. \xc2\xa0But let me just finish this thought by saying our ability to pressure Russia and to send a clear message about how we will not tolerate the violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty is predicated on our ability to coordinate effectively with our allies. \xc2\xa0That\'s why it would be a bad idea to unilaterally withdraw. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States ultimately has built a coalition that is imposing costs against Russia for violating those international norms. \xc2\xa0And the President believes strongly that the United States and our interests are better served by defending those international norms and coordinating with the international community to impose financial costs against Russia for violating them. \xc2\xa0And to unilaterally withdraw from that effort would weaken the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSuzanne.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to follow up with yesterday in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments. Trump said that he was being sarcastic when he called and encouraged Russian intelligence agencies to look into Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails -- deleted emails, the hacked emails, that they would be richly rewarded. \xc2\xa0So can you clarify here, is this something -- a lot of people saw this as beyond the pale, this was unacceptable, and at the very least irresponsible, coming from a presidential candidate. \xc2\xa0How does the White House see this? \xc2\xa0Is this something that you see that\xe2\x80\x99s just an off-the-cuff remark? \xc2\xa0Or is this something the White House is taking seriously as a national security concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Republican nominee explain his comments and explain his motivation. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let other people decide for themselves if they can figure out when Mr. Trump is being sarcastic and when he\xe2\x80\x99s being serious.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can speak to is the policy of the administration, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty simple one. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s one I think is pretty intuitive, one that we\xe2\x80\x99re all familiar with because it\xe2\x80\x99s the same one that\xe2\x80\x99s been pursued by Presidents of both parties since our nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding, which is that the United States of America is committed to defending the American people without regard to which political party they belong to. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is true when it comes to our efforts to protect the American people in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what does that mean, Josh? \xc2\xa0I mean, people who want to know, is there any consequence, is there any reaction, is there any fallout to what he said -- is the White House taking what he said seriously?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I guess my point is I\xe2\x80\x99ll let others react to the controversial comments of the Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0I can be here to help you understand exactly what our policy is and how significant or how important that policy is. \xc2\xa0And when it comes to protecting the American people against all threats, including threats that emanate from overseas, including threats that exist in cyberspace, this country and this government is committed to protecting our citizens without first asking which political party they belong to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is there any move afoot for White House officials to question the candidate or question the campaign at whether or not that was something that was, in fact, something that was real and acceptable? \xc2\xa0Or is it considered a national security issue? \xc2\xa0Does this administration consider it a national security issue, the comments that he made? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let other people characterize his comments. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him explain them as best he can. \xc2\xa0But for me, we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to stick to articulating what our policy is, and I think the differences in our policy and the rhetoric that is being put forward by the other side is quite different.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has said that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot more material that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to the U.S. election that could come out. \xc2\xa0Is there anything that the administration is doing to prepare or respond to in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that anybody is quite sure what Mr. Assange is talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on the issue of hacking, in this cyber age, is there any reason to be surprised or outraged that foreign governments engage in hacking for intelligence gathering or mischief making?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that question a couple different ways. \xc2\xa0The first is, in the interview that President Obama did earlier this week, he acknowledged that we have seen Russia engage in efforts to at least interfere in a democratic process in other countries, including in Europe. \xc2\xa0So we know that interfering in the political process in other countries is a tactic, or even a strategy, that President Putin has used before. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that some have observed is that in this instance, the information wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just hacked, it was also released. \xc2\xa0What that actually says about the potential perpetrator or their motive is something that the FBI will have to speak to. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re obviously conducting an investigation here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them speak to it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess the other element of your question is how serious is this. \xc2\xa0And I think the fact that this is something that has drawn the attention of the FBI and their careful scrutiny and their coordination with experts across the federal government is an indication that a situation like this is certainly something that we take seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you able to say if U.S. intelligence has a policy on hacking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to say what sort of policy may be in place, but the Office of the Director of National Intelligence may be able to provide you with some information about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On last night\xe2\x80\x99s speech, did President Obama know Hillary Clinton was backstage and was going to join him on stage after his speech?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He did know that, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what did he do after the speech? \xc2\xa0There were about 40 minutes between the end of his speech and leaving the convention. \xc2\xa0What was he doing during that period?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0President Obama had an opportunity to visit backstage with Secretary Clinton, members of her family. \xc2\xa0I believe he had an opportunity to see Senator Kaine. \xc2\xa0I actually wasn\xe2\x80\x99t backstage with him once he\xe2\x80\x99d finished delivering his speech, \xc2\xa0but I know that there were a number of people backstage that he was eager to see and spend some time with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s he doing today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule started a little later today, given the late-night arrival last night. \xc2\xa0The President is meeting with members of his national security team. He periodically, once a quarter or so, will receive an update on the terror threat picture, so he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with members of his team to receive that update again today. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout of that meeting this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tPaul.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks very much. \xc2\xa0Just a couple of quick ones. \xc2\xa0The President has kind of hinted about possibly getting involved in the post-presidential period in venture capital. \xc2\xa0What particular area in sort of the VC world has he expressed any particular interest in? \xc2\xa0And what is it about sort of the VC world that interests him do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As I recall, the President talked about this in the interview that he did with Business Week. \xc2\xa0And there are some aspects of that line of work that appeals to some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual interests. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot of interesting work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done in the field of innovation and science that VCs are strongly supporting. \xc2\xa0As President of the United States, the President has an opportunity to be briefed on those kinds of -- on innovations and scientific developments. \xc2\xa0The President has got a council of advisors in science and technology, his PCAST, that he meets with frequently to get some updates on a variety of scientific innovations. \xc2\xa0And I know that he finds those conversations to be exceedingly interesting. \xc2\xa0And the intellectual rigor associated with those conversations is something that he genuinely enjoys.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what the -- because that essentially was what would be part of -- I think part of what a venture capital operation would include is evaluating innovations and testing the likelihood of their success. \xc2\xa0So that, I guess, would be the other thing that I think that he\'s discussed appeals to him, is sort of the rigorous analysis of those kinds of ideas and plans. \xc2\xa0And again, that kind of rational consideration of options is something that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to do as often as he would like in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0Too often there is a rather irrational and dysfunctional evaluation of options that I think the President has previously spoken to as being a source of frustration. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in the VC world there\'s a much more rigorous, cold-eyed analysis that\'s done, a rational decision-making structure is applied. \xc2\xa0And the President is pretty good at that and feels like that\'s something that he would both do well at and find to be incredibly interesting in his post-presidential life. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\'ll actually do it. \xc2\xa0But having read the interview and having heard him talk about this a little bit, I think those are a couple of things that appeal to him about that line of work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- it\'s occurred to me that even in times that are far worse than today -- the dark era of the Civil War, the Great Depression -- Presidents then, Lincoln and Roosevelt, always spoke in terms of faith and optimism and hope for a future. \xc2\xa0Why is it, you think, that Donald Trump\'s darkness now is getting so much traction? \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t live in times nearly as bad as the times I mentioned. \xc2\xa0Why is he getting so much traction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m not sure. \xc2\xa0And I know that there are a lot of theories that have been floated out there. \xc2\xa0I\'ll let other people speculate about that. \xc2\xa0But I will acknowledge that I was thinking about this a little bit myself earlier today, and the thing that occurred to me is, we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have to go that far back in our history to find an example of a time when the United States was facing a really tough challenge. \xc2\xa0When President Obama took office in 2009, the United States was on the brink of a second Great Depression. \xc2\xa0The U.S. auto industry was weeks away from utter collapse, costing millions of Americans -- at least a million Americans their jobs. \xc2\xa0There were hundreds of thousands of jobs that were being hemorrhaged from our economy every month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But why are people responding to fear now and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t then? \xc2\xa0What\'s changed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think -- stick with me on this. \xc2\xa0Even in the midst of what I would readily acknowledge was a scary time for our country in 2008 -- we saw these precipitous declines in the stock market; Congress had to vote for extraordinary legislation that would try to stabilize the financial system -- even in the midst of all of that, President Obama continued to articulate his hope, optimism and confidence in the future. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\'s no denying -- even Mitch McConnell won\'t deny that our country is in a far better position now than we were then -- something that the Majority Leader has committed to publicly. \xc2\xa0And President Obama continues to have a lot of confidence in the country and is more optimistic than ever about the future of our country, in part because we weathered those hard times and we came out stronger on the other end. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot more work that needs to be done. \xc2\xa0And the President walked through some of those examples last night. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I can\'t account for the strategy that\'s being pursued by the Republican presidential nominee. \xc2\xa0But it\'s a lot different than the strategy that President Obama employed in 2008 and 2012, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s a coincidence that President Obama is actually the first President since President Eisenhower to win two national elections back to back, earning a majority vote from the American people* [President Reagan won twice with a majority of the vote. President Obama won twice - getting more than 51% each time. \xc2\xa0He\'s the first President since Eisenhower to do so.]</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think you mean the first Democrat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The first one since Eisenhower. \xc2\xa0He\'s actually the first President, Democrat or Republican, to get more than *50 [51] percent of the vote twice. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, Reagan did it twice, actually.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Reagan did not do it twice.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He got 50.7 in 1980, if I\'m correct. \xc2\xa0The final question --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'ll follow up with you on it. \xc2\xa0I\'m confident the facts are on my side on this one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I could be wrong. \xc2\xa0The final question is, historians were always ranking Presidents, and the numbers kind of move up and down. \xc2\xa0Right now there\'s sort of a general consensus that of the 43 men who have been President that Obama currently bounces around 19, 20, 21 -- sort of in the middle of the pack. \xc2\xa0Does that strike you about right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m sure I\'m biased. \xc2\xa0So, look, I also am confident that historians will spend a lot of time considering the Obama presidency. \xc2\xa0And I think historians acknowledge that, with time, that it\'s easier to draw a more precise evaluation. \xc2\xa0What that means for the actual numbers is something that historians will determine.</p>\n<p>\n\tJane.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you very much, Josh. \xc2\xa0Donald Trump has mentioned that when he\'s elected President of the United States, that he will withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. \xc2\xa0It seems like withdrawing troops from Korea, that it concerns the security of Korean Peninsula and the U.S.-South Korea relationship. \xc2\xa0What is the Democratic Party\'s view of withdrawal on Korean Peninsula?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the United States of America has an ironclad commitment to the security of our South Korean allies. \xc2\xa0That is a commitment that transcends party. \xc2\xa0I know that President Obama\'s predecessor, President George W. Bush, was committed to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. \xc2\xa0I know that President Clinton was, as well. \xc2\xa0So there has been a longstanding tradition of holding that alliance as a high priority and committing the United States to the defense of our South Korean allies. \xc2\xa0That\'s the policy of the United States. \xc2\xa0It is a policy that benefits our national security. \xc2\xa0It\'s a policy that President Obama has prioritized. \xc2\xa0And if there are people who disagree with that policy, even people who are running for President, I\'ll let them make their own case.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, two questions. \xc2\xa0One, as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned, President Obama has had a very cozy and personal relations with at least two prime ministers of India, including Dr. Manmohan Singh and now Prime Minister Modi. \xc2\xa0And not only business-to-business or country-to-country, but also on a personal basis. \xc2\xa0What do you think will be the future after he leaves? \xc2\xa0Because many, including these two prime ministers and millions of people in India will miss him.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, part of President Obama\'s Asia rebalance has included prioritizing the United States relationship with the world\'s largest democracy. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has traveled multiple times to India. \xc2\xa0And the President has been warmly received by the Indian people on each visit. \xc2\xa0I know that he\'s enjoyed each visit. \xc2\xa0And the President has appreciated the effective working relationship that he\'s had with the leaders of both countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOf course, President and Mrs. Obama hosted Prime Minister Singh and his wife here at the White House for the very first White House state dinner. \xc2\xa0And President Obama was able to work effectively with Prime Minister Modi to reach an agreement about the commitments that India would make in the context of the Paris climate talks. \xc2\xa0That was viewed by many as the lynchpin of completing the agreement in Paris. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it\'s an indication of the longstanding warm relationship between the United States and India. \xc2\xa0Some of that is a result of the deep investment of diplomatic capital that President Obama has made in that relationship. \xc2\xa0And he certainly is hopeful that his successor will do the same thing, because it benefits the American people and our economy, and certainly our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think the President will have a word with President Donald Trump or President Hillary Clinton, whoever will be in the White House, before he leaves regarding U.S.-India relations and the future of U.S.-India relations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what President Obama has indicated is that he is committed to ensuring a smooth transition from the Obama administration to his successor. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that will include conversations between President Obama and the President-elect when the time comes. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how wide-ranging that discussion will be. \xc2\xa0It certainly could include India. \xc2\xa0But whoever it is, President Obama is committed to ensuring a smooth transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And second, as far as hate in America and trust in America is concerned, millions of people in India, they think that there is no country -- and of course the Indian-American community here -- on Earth where there\'s a trust in America, or many people want to come here. \xc2\xa0Now, there\'s a program, Invest in America. \xc2\xa0And does the President support, the White House support this program? \xc2\xa0Because thousands of people in India are lining up to come to the U.S. and invest in America, which is close to $500,000 to $1 million for a green card or to be here. \xc2\xa0They feel safer, and there\'s law and order and justice in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Goyal, I\'ll admit I\'m not familiar with that specific program. \xc2\xa0We can see if somebody around here is and can give you our perspective on it. \xc2\xa0We obviously -- and President Obama has made it a priority to seek out people who are committed to invested in the United States. \xc2\xa0Insourcing has been a top priority, and we certainly have welcomed the kind of investment that we\'ve seen from countries around the world and from businesses around the world who recognize the opportunity that exists to invest in the United States. \xc2\xa0That obviously creates jobs and economic opportunity here in the United States, and we\'ve gone to great lengths to try to encourage it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrian, I saw you had your hand up. \xc2\xa0Do you want the last shot here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0I actually wanted to ask about the transition also. \xc2\xa0Next week, the GSA has made office space available to the two candidates. \xc2\xa0And I\'m just wondering, has the President said any -- given any specific marching orders or instructions to his agencies, to his people about how they should pursue -- or to what degree they should cooperate --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President made clear at the beginning of this year that one of the top priorities of the federal government is to ensure the smooth transition from the Obama administration to the next administration. \xc2\xa0President Obama benefitted tremendously from the effective management and planning that was performed by his predecessor to ensure a smooth transition from the Bush administration to the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0It\'s one of the reasons that President Obama holds President Bush in high regard. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Bush was committed to that effective transition across political parties. \xc2\xa0And this is a testament to President Bush and his commitment to this country and to the institution of the presidency, and President Obama shares that commitment. \xc2\xa0President Obama has identified the same priority and has certainly used the strategy employed by President Bush as a template for his team. \xc2\xa0And so I can tell you that, for months, senior officials here at the White House have been engaged in planning, interacting with senior officials at a wide variety of government agencies to begin preparing now, months before the actual election, to ensure that that smooth transition takes place.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama believes that this is what the American people can and should expect from their federal government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right? \xc2\xa0Thanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:41 P.M.
