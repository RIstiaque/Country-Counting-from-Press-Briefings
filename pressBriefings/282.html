EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all had a good weekend and spent some quality time with your mothers -- even on the phone if necessary.\xc2\xa0 Let me do two quick things and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is, the President and his team here at the White House have been monitoring the storms that occurred overnight in Texas and throughout the Midwest.\xc2\xa0 The President is receiving updates.\xc2\xa0 We know that our officials in FEMA -- or at FEMA offices in both Kansas City and Denton are closely monitoring the response efforts.\xc2\xa0 At this point, we have not received any official request for federal assistance, but we continue to be in close touch with the state and local officials who do have the primary responsibility for responding to those storms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about the communities that were affected, some quite violently, overnight by these storms.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep them in our thoughts and prayers, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to stand with them as they rebuild from the destruction that they saw as a result of the weather.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing that I want to point out is today is the last day for Jessica Santillo, who has served the President in a number of capacities, including in his campaign but also here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s been a fixture in lower press, dealing with many of your inquiries about a variety of things, including the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And throughout all of that, she has demonstrated the kind of professionalism and grace and commitment to this cause that is certainly something that we all admire.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s going to move on to some private sector opportunities, and we certainly wish her well as she does that.\xc2\xa0 But she\xe2\x80\x99s definitely going to be missed around my office.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo thank you, Jessica, for your service.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNedra, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 What changed since last Friday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of the Saudi King\xe2\x80\x99s visit to lead to the trip being called off?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, the goal of the meeting that the President has planned for Camp David later this week is to discuss the best ways to deepen and modernize the important security relationship between the United States and our GCC partners.\xc2\xa0 The countries who are participating in the meeting have obviously made decisions about who they believe is best positioned to represent their countries at the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And given the goals that I\xe2\x80\x99ve just outlined, we agree that the right people will be attending, and are confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the right people around the table at Camp David for discussing and acting on these priorities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the travel plans of the King, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to his office for more information about his change in travel plans.\xc2\xa0 There are a couple things I can tell you about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is there\xe2\x80\x99s been no concern raised by our Saudi partners, either before the change in travels plans or after, related to the agenda at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 So I know that there had been some speculation that this change in travel plans was an attempt to send a message to the United States.\xc2\xa0 If so, that message was not received, because all the feedback that we have received from the Saudis has been positive.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that Secretary of State John Kerry was in Riyadh last week, where he had the opportunity to meet with the King directly.\xc2\xa0 And in the context of that meeting, the King and other senior members of his national security team that visited with Secretary of State Kerry expressed satisfaction and even some optimism about the possibilities of the Camp David agenda.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry also met with all of his counterparts in Paris last week.\xc2\xa0 These are his GCC counterparts.\xc2\xa0 And even coming out of those discussions, there was widespread agreement that this was going to be a worthwhile session with the President of the United States, and each of those countries indicated that they were looking forward to it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll close by just pointing out that Saudi Arabia will be ably represented at the meeting by the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the former interior minister.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who is obviously well known to members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, and he\xe2\x80\x99s well known to the President himself because he has convened meetings with the President in the Oval Office two times over the last two years or so.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll also be joined by the Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who happens to be the son of the King and is the chief defense official.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo obviously, for the purposes of having a meeting about how to deepen our security cooperation with our partners in Saudi Arabia, having the Crown Prince and the Deputy Crown Prince, both of whom have leadership responsibilities when it comes to providing for the security of Saudi Arabia, gives us confidence that we\'ll be able to have a robust discussion at Camp David, but also that we\'ll be able to follow through on the commitments that are made in the context of the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it safe to assume, since your deputy announced the visit on Friday, that the King had formally accepted the invitation at one point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that is true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the White House consider this a snub of any kind?\xc2\xa0 Or how do you interpret this then?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, for the reasons that the King changed his travel plans, I\'d refer you to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m confident that they will tell you is that the travel plans are completely unrelated to the agenda that\'s planned for Camp David.\xc2\xa0 And again, that is based on the private conversations that the Secretary of State has had with the King himself and with other senior officials in Saudi Arabia, both in Riyadh and in Paris.\xc2\xa0 That\'s evident from the public statements that we have seen from senior members of the Saudi Arabian national security team so far.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to be confident that the senior officials who will be representing the interest of Saudi Arabia at the meeting will be able to -- are empowered to not just represent the views of Saudi Arabia in the meeting, but also to implement any decisions that are made in the context of the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the point is, the President wanted to convene a discussion with our GCC partners with the goal of modernizing and deepening our security cooperation with them.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll point out that these GCC members consider the security cooperation that they have with the United States as integral to their own country\xe2\x80\x99s national security.\xc2\xa0 So it is in the interest of these countries to send senior members of their national security team who can represent the views of their country and ensure that they live up to any commitments that they make in the context of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And based on the list of attendees that we\'ve seen so far, we\'re confident that that will occur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On that, with the change in plans that we found out about over the weekend that will now leave only two out of the six GCC rulers attending the summit at Camp David, how does the White House see that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that number present a snub to the White House?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not a snub?\xc2\xa0 If you\'re only getting two of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve identified the word of the day in the briefing today.\xc2\xa0 No, fair enough.\xc2\xa0 That was probably the word of the day in the briefing based on the press coverage before we even started going through these questions, which is why I\'m happy to talk to you about them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWell, we\'ve walked through the situation in Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be confident that the senior national security officials who can both represent the interest of Saudi Arabia at the meeting and follow through on any commitments that Saudi Arabia makes in the context of the meeting will be present and accounted for at the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe same is true when it\'s applied to the four other countries that are participating in addition to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 Let me give you another example.\xc2\xa0 The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, is the deputy commander of the UAE military, but is the principal interlocutor between the United States and the UAE when it comes to significant national security questions like this one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, we continue to be completely confident that Mohammed bin Zayed, as the senior representative of the UAE at the meeting, will, again, be able to represent the interests of his country in the discussion, and ensure that any commitments that he makes on behalf of his country will be fully and appropriately implemented.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that there was never a commitment from anyone other than Mohammed bin Zayed to lead the UAE delegation at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously pleased that -- I mean, so I guess the point is, taken together, if you look at the individuals who will be sitting around the table with the President at Camp David, we continue to be confident that these are individuals who can represent the interests of their country and implement any commitments that they make in the context of the meeting.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore importantly, the countries that are sending the delegations have confidence that these are the appropriate individuals to participate in this meeting.\xc2\xa0 And, again, to the extent that we are seeking to reassure those nations about the importance of their security relationship with the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s in their interest to ensure that the right leaders are attending the meeting.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from all the countries that they will be able to provide -- or that the necessary officials will participate in the meeting at the right time.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made the right decision about who to send.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic -- Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Putin in Sochi.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the utility of that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat is the U.S. hoping to get out of that meeting?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard maintaining lines of communication, but it seems pretty clear where the U.S. stands in respect to eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So could you just explain what you hope to get out of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit about how complicated the relationship is between the United States and Russia; that there are a variety of areas where the United States has been able to successfully work with Russia in pursuit of interests that benefit the citizens of both our countries.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been a wide range of things.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRussia has participated in the P5+1 negotiations with Iran.\xc2\xa0 They have been an important partner in putting in place the sanctions regime that has compelled Iran to the negotiating table, and we have been appreciative of the role that they have played in that effort.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s much discussion about the way that the United States and Russia was able to work together to dispose of Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical weapons stockpile.\xc2\xa0 That would not have been possible without the leadership of Russia, using their unique relationship with the Assad regime, to both convince the Assad regime to declare their chemical weapons stockpile, but then also to effectuate the destruction of that chemical stockpile.\xc2\xa0 And that did highlight the strong working relationship between the United States and Russia when it comes in pursuit of our mutual interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve also, as you pointed out, not been shy about identifying those areas where we have had pretty sharp disagreements with Russia that\xe2\x80\x99s principally come on the issue of Ukraine and the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that independent nation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview of the specific meeting that Secretary Kerry will be convening in Sochi.\xc2\xa0 But this relationship will, of course, be against the backdrop of those conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Continuing on Syria, what is the common ground that Russia and the United States have about Syria?\xc2\xa0 Why is there reason for the talks themselves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to Syria, I mean, obviously the significant concern that we had about Syria\xe2\x80\x99s declared chemical stockpile was that it presented a significant proliferation risk; that when you\xe2\x80\x99re in a chaotic war-torn country, like in Syria, that there is the risk that extremists could get their hands on those chemical weapons and proliferate them around the globe, putting citizens of both our countries at pretty deep risk.\xc2\xa0 And so it was in the clear interest of the United States and Russia to get the Assad regime to acknowledge that chemical weapons stockpile existed, and to engage in a broader international effort to ensure that those chemical weapons were destroyed so they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used anywhere else.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good example of where our interests align.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going forward, Josh, I understand what\xe2\x80\x99s already happened.\xc2\xa0 But sending the Secretary of State to talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s going forward, what is the common ground he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at that you feel might cause Syria to reengage and help settle a civil war there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that this is going to be the only thing that they discuss.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of things that are obviously on our mutual list of interests here.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest for there to continue to be this widespread violence and chaos inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 This is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to effectively build a coalition of more than 60 countries to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Because the prospect of these violent extremists getting a foothold inside Syria and establishing a safe haven does pose a risk most immediately to countries in the region, but it certainly poses a risk to countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been able to work with Russia in pursuit of that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut more broadly, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that a lot of the conversation that the Secretary of State will have both with his counterpart and with President Putin will include a discussion about the need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and ongoing efforts to try to deescalate the violence in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But respectfully, I\xe2\x80\x99m still not hearing what\xe2\x80\x99s in it for Syria, because Syria [sic] has backed Assad -- continues to back Assad.\xc2\xa0 And while they did help with the ridding of the nuclear weapons, how is the civil war in Syria hurting Russia?\xc2\xa0 Because it continues to leave the man they want in power, in power.\xc2\xa0 What is in it for Russia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s in it for Russia is that it is not in their interest for there to be a chaotic war-torn country where violent extremists could seek to establish a safe haven.\xc2\xa0 And anytime you see that kind of violence and chaos in a country like Syria, that obviously raises significant concerns from countries in the immediate vicinity of Syria, but also around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do those extremists really threaten Russia?\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think they mostly threaten the West?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think President Putin would be happy to convey to you what he believes is a long list of risks and threats that are posed by violent extremists.\xc2\xa0 And I know that this counterterrorism area is an area where the United States and Russia had been able to effectively cooperate.\xc2\xa0 So I know that President Putin shares that concern.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to the Saudi King?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has not recently, but I would not be surprised if the President does have an opportunity to consult with him directly prior to the start of the Camp David meetings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that could happen today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but nothing specifically planned?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if there is a conversation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you were making the argument that these Gulf nations are sending the appropriate representatives.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President is still not meeting with his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 So does that not diminish the gravitas, the seriousness, the effectiveness of this summit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not in the mind of the President and not in the mind of anybody here.\xc2\xa0 There is important work to be done to deepen and modernize these security relationships.\xc2\xa0 And having the senior security officials from each of these countries represented in a way that they can participate robustly in the discussions represent the interests of their country and follow through on any commitments that they make in the context of the meeting gives us some confidence that this will be a worthwhile session.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, the goal here is for each of these countries to strengthen -- further strengthen the important security relationship that they have with the United States.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of these countries to send the appropriate individuals who can participate in the discussions, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s occurring.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United States, is the President prepared to offer any concessions to any of these nations, perhaps allow them to buy more weapons, for example, than they currently --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess if any sort of agreement like that were reached, I would not at all characterize that as a concession.\xc2\xa0 These are partners of ours, and we have an interest in the continued security cooperation that we have with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo whether it\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence cooperation, counterterrorism efforts, or even enhancing the national defense of these countries, this is something that the United States is invested in and has been invested in for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And this will be the substance of the discussions that will be underway at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to preview in terms of what kinds of outcomes we anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, but I do believe and the President continues to believe that the appropriate individuals representing these countries will be in attendance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to ask you about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s comments about Senator Warren over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cOn this one, though\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning the discussion of the trade deal -- \xe2\x80\x9cher arguments don\xe2\x80\x99t stand the test of fact and scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I just want to be clear -- is he accusing her of lying for political gain?\xc2\xa0 What is he specifically saying there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President had about a 20-minute conversation with Matt Bai, and they released the text of the interview.\xc2\xa0 So I think you got a good sense about what the President meant, if you look at the transcript.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is he worried that by having this public dispute with her, that he could, in fact, wind up alienating some of the Democratic lawmakers that he wants to get on board?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about that at all, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President is either.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s been blunt about his views on this topic and why he believes that Democrats should be supportive of a trade agreement that, if reached, would clearly be in the best interest of our economy and clearly would be in the best interest of middle-class families across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Elizabeth Warren said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the President is so confident it\xe2\x80\x99s a good deal, he should declassify the text and let people see it before asking Congress to tie its hands on fixing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s response to that?\xc2\xa0 Why not declassify it now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The point is that if Senator Warren is wondering what she\xe2\x80\x99s voting on, then she can walk over to the room that has been established on Capitol Hill, by the U.S. Trade Representative, and she can read the latest version of the negotiated document.\xc2\xa0 So there is no need for this false criticism that the members of Congress aren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated.\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they have failed to take the responsibility to read the document.\xc2\xa0 It will be provided to them.\xc2\xa0 And that, the President believes, is an important part of this commitment to work with Congress to reach this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And those who do understand what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated have a reason to be supportive of it.\xc2\xa0 And I think the best example I can point you to is to take a look at the vote in the Senate Finance Committee -- that when carefully considered by the Senate Finance Committee, there were hearings that were held, and I assume that many, if not every member of the committee took time to review what was being negotiated, that it earned the support of a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a small sample size, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication to Democrats who are undecided, or at least considering how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on this, that there is ample reason for them to consider why this particular agreement would be clearly in the best interest of our economy and clearly in the best interest of middle-class families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a bit.\xc2\xa0 Jordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On trade, are you guys confident that Democrats will have the votes to advance TPA tomorrow when the Senate holds the test vote?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s important, Jordan, is for Democrats and Republicans to have the votes.\xc2\xa0 This is something that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pass on party line.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s only Republicans who are supporting it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to reach the 60-vote threshold; and if it\xe2\x80\x99s only Democrats who are supporting it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to reach the 60-vote threshold.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what we need is we need to build a bipartisan coalition.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been trying to do his part to make the case to Democrats, some of whom started out reluctant.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit in here about the reflexive opposition that exists in many corners of the Democratic Party about trade agreements.\xc2\xa0 And the case that the President made in private is very similar to the case that the President has made in public that Kristen referred to -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s made a very strong case about why he believes this is in the best interest of our economy both in the short term and over the long term.\xc2\xa0 And that is what has led him to strongly support trying to advance this particular trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that other Democrats will keep an open mind as they evaluate what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he making any calls or holding any emails with lawmakers today on trade?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President has been in frequent conversations with members of Congress -- mostly Democrats, but some Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any detailed information to convey to you about those communications or those meetings.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last one on the defense bill.\xc2\xa0 I know that House Republicans are trying to reinsert some language into that bill that would delay some regulations that have been placed on payday lenders to military members.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that is something that would prompt the White House to issue an official veto threat of the defense bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have already raised significant concerns about a variety of provisions included in the Defense Authorization Act.\xc2\xa0 You have identified yet another one.\xc2\xa0 There is a provision in this bill that would protect loopholes that allow predatory lenders to target military families.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s almost too difficult to believe that you\xe2\x80\x99d have a member of Congress looking to carry water for the payday loan industry, and allow them to continue to target in a predatory fashion military families who in many case are already in a vulnerable financial state.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about military families who have a loved one that\xe2\x80\x99s deployed overseas, and as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to makes ends meet to allow predatory lenders to target them is something that I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine earning the majority support in the United States Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSteve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some Democrats who generally support fast track, but they want to attach this currency provision that the Treasury Secretary has already warned that if currency is attached and bolted on to the fast track bill, that that could potentially undermine getting to a final agreement with all these Asian countries for TPP.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House working aggressively to kill that currency provision?\xc2\xa0 Would it be something that the White House would need to threaten a veto on so that it\xe2\x80\x99s not bolted on to this TPA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, what we have indicated is that we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a better way for us to resolve concerns related to currency.\xc2\xa0 The administration over the last six years has tried to address a wide range of currency issues with other countries through the designated international fora for negotiating these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the G7 or the G20 or at the International Monetary Fund meetings, the United States has been engaged in conversations with other countries to talk to them about exchange rates.\xc2\xa0 And there are a couple of examples that I can cite of progress that has been made in this regard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChina\xe2\x80\x99s exchange rate is up nearly 30 percent on a real effective basis since 2010.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we have not seen Japan intervene in the foreign exchange market for more than three years.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that our advocacy through these multilateral meetings has been effective in a way that has effectively protected American businesses and American workers from some unfair practices.\xc2\xa0 The concern that we have about some of the approaches that are currently being discussed on Capitol Hill is that they could be used to effectively undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.\xc2\xa0 And so this is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a robust conversation on Capitol Hill about the best way to move this forward, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ready to pass judgment on any specific legislative proposal along these lines at this point.\xc2\xa0 But our concerns about some of the proposals that have been floated are well known.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something, though, that you would threaten to veto, if that\xe2\x80\x99s attached to fast track, that would be not worth signing that bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not willing to make that commitment at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what we would like to see, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we can build some bipartisan support in the Senate to get it passed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House at all disappointed in how the Saudis have handled the King\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to come?\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that he had committed, that he had said he was coming, and to find out just days before the summit is supposed to take place would seem to me to be a disappointment for the White House.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if you feel like the Saudis have handled it properly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, as I mentioned before, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on is making sure that we had the proper senior-level representation from each of these countries to participate in a discussion about how to deepen and modernize the security relationship between the United States and our GCC partners.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, seated around the table will be representatives of these countries that are empowered to represent the views of their country and their national interest in the discussions, and ensure that they follow through on any commitments that those countries make in the context of the Camp David meeting.\xc2\xa0 That is the bottom line, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking for, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve received, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is looking forward to the meeting later this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t sure a message was being sent because one hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been received here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fair to say that the Saudis are concerned about the Iran nuclear deal?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that this is part of the reason why the King is not coming?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, they have said -- the Saudis themselves have said that the reason for the change in the King\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule is not related at all to the substance of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think what they have indicated is that he has said that he would prefer to remain in Saudi Arabia to monitor the implementation of the humanitarian pause in Yemen.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the Iran framework, the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m consulting my notes here is that there was a specific statement that was put out by the Saudi cabinet soon after the announcement of the Iran framework in which they said -- in which they expressed \xe2\x80\x9ctheir hope for attaining a binding and definitive agreement that would lead to the strengthening of security and stability in the region and the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So the early indications from the Saudi --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that an endorsement, do you think, of the framework?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what it is, is it is an indication that they recognize that there is a significant national security benefit for Saudi Arabia in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also an indication that they are at least open to the argument that the President has made that the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly were encouraged by that specific statement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think what the Saudis would probably be quick to tell you is the same thing that lots of other people in this country would be quick to tell you, which is that they want to evaluate the final agreement, and that is something that is still being negotiated by our experts.\xc2\xa0 And what we are striving to achieve is a final agreement that reflects the broad political framework that was announced in early April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess, just getting back to the protocol aspect of this, the President, when he was in India, cut short that trip so he could go to Saudi Arabia and pay his respects to the fallen king and meet the new monarch who was being brought in.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that the President has shown respect to the Saudi family and the Saudi Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State was just there this last week.\xc2\xa0 Your deputy said on Air Force One late last week that it was expected that the King was coming.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if -- I would assume that this was, at the very least, a surprise.\xc2\xa0 But I have to ask, is the President disappointed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the President did cut short his visit to India in order to make a stop in Saudi Arabia while that nation was mourning the loss of King Abdullah.\xc2\xa0 And I think many of you all who reported on that visit noted that it was an important symbolic gesture that reflected the depth of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, on the back end of that symbolic visit was a working meeting that the President convened with King Salman.\xc2\xa0 The meeting that the President has scheduled for later this week is not symbolic; it\xe2\x80\x99s one where the President anticipates having a specific and robust discussion about how to deepen and modernize our security relationship with our GCC partners.\xc2\xa0 And the proper leadership will be attending that meeting, and that is to say these are individuals who are empowered to represent the interests of their country in those discussions and ensure that any commitments that they make in the context of that meeting will be implemented.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there is a very practical, specific reason for this particular meeting, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re less interested in symbolic messages and much more interested in the actual discussions that will take place later this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know that the journalist, Seymour Hersh, has put out an article on the facts and circumstances that were involved in the killing of Osama bin Laden -- the mission to kill Osama bin Laden.\xc2\xa0 And I know the White House has put out a statement saying that the article is \xe2\x80\x9cbaseless\xe2\x80\x9d and essentially false.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- are the facts that the public generally understand about the killing of Osama bin Laden, is that story essentially what happened?\xc2\xa0 Are there any elements of that story that perhaps are not correct in the public\xe2\x80\x99s mind and information that\xe2\x80\x99s been put out by the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the Obama White House is not the only one to observe that the story is riddled with inaccuracies and outright falsehoods.\xc2\xa0 The former Deputy Director of the CIA, Mike Morell, has said that every sentence was wrong.\xc2\xa0 And, Jim, I actually thought one of your colleagues at CNN put it best.\xc2\xa0 Peter Bergen, a security analyst for CNN, described the story as being about 10,000 words in length; and he said, based on reading it, that what\xe2\x80\x99s true in the story isn\xe2\x80\x99t new, and what\xe2\x80\x99s new in the story isn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xc2\xa0 So I thought that was a pretty good way of describing why no one here is particularly concerned about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask you about a concert that was held in Baltimore last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry I missed it.\xc2\xa0 It sounded like it was pretty interesting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Did you attend?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I did.\xc2\xa0 So did Kristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You did?\xc2\xa0 Is that right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I reported on it.\xc2\xa0 We were reporting on it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Boy, you are just a slave to your profession, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, Kristen?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Talk about getting the real story.\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just cover that concert from afar; we needed to be there in the front row.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was close.\xc2\xa0 I got a chance to see a lot.\xc2\xa0 But going back to the concert and the Rally for Peace, the message is meaningful for urban areas and those who have had issues with policing.\xc2\xa0 And the musical artist, Prince, was the one who put this on last night, and he said something -- he said that the system is broken and it needs to be fixed now.\xc2\xa0 Realistically, what can be fixed before this President leaves office, as he has put a spotlight on this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President has acknowledged is a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the vast majority of our law enforcement officers across the country do a very difficult job very well.\xc2\xa0 And these are individuals who have chosen a very honorable profession, if not a calling, to be willing to put on that uniform every day, walk out the door, and be prepared to put their life on the line to protect that community.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that is worthy of our respect.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be participating in the National Peace Officers Memorial at the end of this week, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk about that a little bit more.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what is also true is that there are some isolated situations where people I think for justifiable reasons believe that the law is not being fairly implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that is the source of some concern because that does feed some distrust between law enforcement and the community or communities that they\xe2\x80\x99re sworn to serve and protect.\xc2\xa0 And that gap in trust makes police work more dangerous.\xc2\xa0 It also makes it easier for crime to infiltrate in those communities.\xc2\xa0 So the interest of neither the police nor the community is being served when there is a rupture between them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is why you saw the President convene a Task Force on 21st Century Policing to bring community leaders and law enforcement officials together to engage in a discussion of best practices -- what are some of the steps that have been taken in some communities that have enhanced trust between local law enforcement in the community -- with the hope that those best practices can be shared with communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one specific example of how the President believes that we can start to address some of these issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that this kind of distrust and the kinds of situations that have contributed to this distrust have been around for a long time, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not the kinds of things that are going to get solved overnight.\xc2\xa0 But what the President is confident in is that if we have people who enter these professions for the right reasons, and if we have people of goodwill who are leaders in the community who are willing to step forward and work with police to try to bridge their differences, that that can have a material impact on the success that law enforcement has in building strong relationships in communities and preventing crime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I want to drill down on this a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 Because those statements are echoed throughout the nation, not just by a superstar entertainer or several superstar entertainers who say this.\xc2\xa0 What realistically, though, within the next two years can realistically be done to start to break this cycle that has been going on for decades and maybe even centuries?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what realistically in the next two years, as this administration is I guess winding down, what can be expected -- tangibly?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there are a very specific set of recommendations and principles that were outlined in the Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\xc2\xa0 And I think as a very tangible matter, that is what communities across the country can begin to do -- that we can have our local elected leaders, certainly leaders in law enforcement and community leaders come together around implementing some of those best practices.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of a very tangible contribution to addressing some of those problems, I\'d refer you to that document.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true -- and the President made note of this a couple of weeks ago when he was talking about this in the Rose Garden -- is that we can\'t allow all of this to just be boiled down to a law enforcement problem; that the kind of distrust and violence that we see in some communities that\'s directed toward law enforcement is indicative of a much broader and more deep-rooted set of concerns.\xc2\xa0 And the commitment to trying to address the economic inequality and economic injustice in many of these communities will have an impact on our ability to try to lower the crime rate and strengthen the relationship with law enforcement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd whether it\'s making sure that every child in America has access to high-quality early childhood education, or that every kid that wants to go to college can find a way to pay for it, or ensuring that there are job-training opportunities available to those who want to go get some skills that are needed in the workforce and prepare themselves to make a good living -- it could even be something as simple as raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 Right now, if you\'re trying to raise a family of four by working full-time and earning the minimum wage, you\'re raising that family of four below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not fair.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not consistent with the values in this country that hard work should lead to a decent living.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so these are the kinds of common-sense steps that, again, are not going to be implemented overnight, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make a difference overnight, but they can certainly start moving us in the right direction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about any conversations that she\xe2\x80\x99s having with mayors, singularly, in certain problematic cities, or mayors as a whole, when it comes to the summer and trying to lessen or just prevent any of what we saw this spring and last summer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, you\xe2\x80\x99ll also recall that last week the President had the opportunity to visit the conference call with a number of mayors who were meeting in Philadelphia from across the country who were talking about this exact problem.\xc2\xa0 And they spent a lot of time in that meeting talking about what they can do to better meet the needs of the young people in their community.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this is something that the administration is focused on, and this is not just a White House thing that the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are Cabinet officials, like Secretary Duncan, obviously Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, Valerie Jarrett has been engaged in conversations with mayors about how to address this problem and further reduce violence in our communities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So summer jobs, rec centers opening, what are the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can have somebody follow up with you to get you some more specific information about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Elizabeth Warren and the trade talk.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to Elizabeth Warren in the last few weeks since this sort of war of words deepened between them on fast track?\xc2\xa0 And if not, when was the last time they spoke?\xc2\xa0 And lastly, has the opposition -- outspoken opposition of such a prominent liberal Democratic figure complicated his ability to attract Democratic lawmakers to his side on fast track?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I\'m not in a position to detail every conversation that the President has been having with members of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any of the discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to get into the details of that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any -- I\'m not personally aware of any specific conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with her recently.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I wouldn\'t rule them out because the fact is the President has been having a number of conversations over the last several weeks on this.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s possible that he may have had a conversation with her that I\'m not aware of.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to his effort to make the case and win the support of Democrats both on Capitol Hill and across the country, we\'re going to continue to make an aggressive case.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made a very powerful case about why anybody who is focused on advancing the interest of middle-class families is going to take a close look and likely be supportive of this kind of trade agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 That those who are particularly concerned about the negative impact that recent trade agreements have had on middle-class families would acknowledge that failing to engage in the Asia Pacific and declining to support or engage in the Trans-Pacific Partnership would essentially just lock in the status quo.\xc2\xa0 And those companies that have left the United States and sought to invest in countries that have lower labor standards are companies that have already left.\xc2\xa0 And if we want to try to make the case to those companies that they should invest in America, again, we need to start leveling the playing field.\xc2\xa0 And if we can start to raise working standards in other countries, it\'s going to give them an incentive to consider a country like the United States that has a lot to offer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe may not have the cheapest labor in the world, but we do have the most dedicated, hardest-working workers in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have the most aggressive entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 We have the best colleges and universities.\xc2\xa0 We have a system that will allow innovators who are willing to follow the rules to have a genuine opportunity to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And those are the kinds of -- that\'s the kind of environment that we can offer that gives us a significant competitive edge over the rest of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How has her opposition in particular affected this?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s singling out her and her criticism.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not talking publicly about Richard Trumka and Leo Gerard, or the Sierra Club, or other opponents.\xc2\xa0 It\'s Elizabeth Warren who he feels he needs to address publicly her criticism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess -- I mean, I\'d have to go back and look at the transcript.\xc2\xa0 But at least as it relates to the specific interview that he did on Friday, he was asked directly about Senator Warren\xe2\x80\x99s comments, and that is what prompted the response.\xc2\xa0 The thing that I\'ll say is that there\xe2\x80\x99s recent polling data to indicate that the President\xe2\x80\x99s message is starting to have an impact.\xc2\xa0 The latest NBC poll that was just published last week indicated that there is now a plurality of Americans that believes that free trade helps the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so that is an indication that people are open to the argument that the President is making, or at least a plurality of Americans is open to that argument.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to continue to make that case to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And again, as I mentioned earlier, we did see that when a vote was taken on the most progressive trade promotion authority legislation by the Senate Finance Committee, that a majority of Democrats and a majority of Republicans supported it.\xc2\xa0 And that makes us optimistic that we can build the kind of bipartisan support that\'s necessary to advance this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, would the summit this week be better if King Salman were here?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying it would make no difference whether he shows up or not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\'m saying is that what will make the summit successful is ensuring that we have representatives of each of the countries that can represent their country\xe2\x80\x99s view in the discussion and follow through on any commitments they make in the context of that discussion.\xc2\xa0 And we have those representatives around the table -- or we will have those representatives around the table at Camp David when the meetings begin on Thursday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is notoriously, let us say, unmoved by summits.\xc2\xa0 He said publicly many times he gets bored by them.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- always sure they make all that much headway.\xc2\xa0 That\'s when heads of state are with him.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 So what I\'m asking is, why does he believe a summit in which four of the nations will not even send a head of state will be as important as a summit where -- summits before when he said even with heads of state present you don\'t often get that much done?\xc2\xa0 And by that logic, why not just send your Defense Secretary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think the reason for that is that the five GCC countries who are participating in the summit I can assure you that they understand the significance of the summit and the importance of their security relationship with the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why they\xe2\x80\x99re sending anybody.\xc2\xa0 And what we are seeing is that they are sending representatives of their country at a level appropriate in terms of being able to represent the views of their country and follow through on any commitments that are made in the context of the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is looking forward to here, is a substantive, legitimate discussion of these important issues.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\'m sure there will be plenty of pictures taken, so I don\'t have to get our news photographer friends worried about it, but this is not just a photo op.\xc2\xa0 This is an opportunity for us to have a substantive discussion about how to deepen and modernize the security relationship between the United States and our GCC allies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd while we here in the United States certainly value that relationship, I can tell you that those GCC countries understand that that relationship is critical to their very existence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The biggest issue right now for Saudi Arabia, at least immediately, is Yemen.\xc2\xa0 The Houthis announced yesterday that they would accept a cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 What degree of confidence does this administration have that that cease-fire will hold?\xc2\xa0 What does it hope to achieve during that time?\xc2\xa0 And how much will this be a part of the conversations at Camp David?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m confident that this will be something that is discussed at Camp David because this is a source of a lot of concern among the GCC countries; that they see this instability and even chaos inside of Yemen as a security threat to -- certainly not just to Saudi Arabia but to other countries in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99re obviously concerned about the destabilizing impact that Iran appears to be playing in this situation.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is a source of some concern to them, and I\'m confident that this will be discussed.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we hope to achieve by the cease-fire is that we can bring badly needed humanitarian aid to those who have been caught in the cross-fire in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 All of this chaos has had a terrible impact on the humanitarian situation there, and we know that there -- we\'ve already seen reports of food shortages and fuel shortages and other things that are critical to daily life.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been very concerned for some time about the humanitarian toll that this violence and chaos is taking on the Yemeni population.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that over the course of the five days that this cease-fire is in place that many of those needs will be met.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then there was one other part to your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the cease-fire in the context of it providing any sort of springboard for a political resolution.\xc2\xa0 Do you not see it as such?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been concerned about the violence there for some time, and we have been urging all sides to get started with all-party negotiations, led by the U.N.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. has offered to step in and facilitate this role.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. representative to Yemen was here in the White House in the last couple of weeks, meeting with members of our national security team here to talk about this important role.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the violence that we see in Yemen right now is not going to address the political differences that exist within that country.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to need all of the parties to set aside the violence and engage in political negotiations to try to resolve their differences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United Nations has offered to step in and try to facilitate those conversations consistent with other GCC agreements that have previously been established in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that in the context of this cease-fire agreement that there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that all the parties could begin those kinds of political negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But the goal, the point of this cease-fire is specifically to try to address -- give the international community the opportunity to address the pretty dire humanitarian situation that we see in that country right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, on trade.\xc2\xa0 In the interview you discussed, the President said Senator Warren is a politician like anybody else.\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he meant that she\xe2\x80\x99s making a political case.\xc2\xa0 And --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask her if she believes it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the President saying when he says she\xe2\x80\x99s a politician like anybody else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That they\xe2\x80\x99re having a political debate about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true -- we are having a robust political debate, but we feel good about the progress that we\'ve made in the context of that political debate.\xc2\xa0 In the United States Senate, in the Finance Committee, we got a majority or Republicans and a majority of Democrats to support this particular proposal.\xc2\xa0 And when you consider the political views of people all across the country, we\'re seeing that a plurality of Americans at least is open to the argument that the President is making about the opportunity that exists by opening up more overseas markets to American goods and services.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was she implying that she\xe2\x80\x99s insincere?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was blunt about the fact that some of her facts are wrong, and there is a substantive disagreement that they have on this.\xc2\xa0 But the President is also confident that those Democrats who are willing to set aside their reflexive opposition to anything that has trade associated with it and actually consider whether or not this proposal is in the best interest of American workers and American families, that we\'re optimistic about our ability to win over the support and votes of a number of Democrats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say in the House you are further ahead in that than you were two weeks ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s hard to say.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s principally hard to say because I\'m not at all the designated vote counter in the administration.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know the people who are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 And what they say is that the conversations that the President has been having with members of Congress, most of them Democrats, have been useful and that there have been Democrats who have been willing to set aside their reflexive opposition to anything that has trade associated with it and consider the argument that the President has made.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s yielded us some votes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you can identify even one of those, please let me know.\xc2\xa0 You went from no to yes because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s urging.\xc2\xa0 Could you do that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My guess is that\xe2\x80\x99s something that will likely be clear once we\'ve actually had an opportunity to take a vote, because I also think that this is a case that we\'re going to continue to make right up until the vote, and we\'re not going to take any of those votes for granted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple quick things.\xc2\xa0 Just back on trade.\xc2\xa0 In your answer to Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question about transparency or putting the trade pact forward, you know that Senator Warren has said that she has read it; she has read the draft.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad to hear that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s true of all of her colleagues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you were not aware of that?\xc2\xa0 You seemed to suggest --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was not aware of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when she\xe2\x80\x99s talking about advocating more transparency, one of the questions she\xe2\x80\x99s asking is, if on its face the draft is such a persuasive case supporting what the President is saying, why is the President not advocating that the language be publicly available -- publicly available?\xc2\xa0 And the answer is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not final.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not been agreed to.\xc2\xa0 And nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.\xc2\xa0 But the good news is that when the agreement is reached, if one is reached, there will be a 60-day period where everyone will have an opportunity to review the final agreement before the President even signs it.\xc2\xa0 So that will be part of how this works, is that there will be full transparency for the American public for two months prior to the President signing the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true is then, from there, Congress will have an opportunity to consider it.\xc2\xa0 And any vote that Congress takes in terms of this trade agreement will be done with the public\xe2\x80\x99s full knowledge of exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 But right now the negotiations are still underway, and so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to make public a document that all the parties have not yet committed to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if public understanding of it might possibly weigh in on the votes that lawmakers might feel comfortable casting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, before members of Congress have to vote on the trade agreement, there will be ample opportunity for the American public to review it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample opportunity to review it prior to the President signing it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample opportunity for reviewing it prior to Congress taking a vote on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And switching gears to another topic, and that is presidential fundraising for both his library and potentially for the Democratic nominee going forward.\xc2\xa0 Because the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think the library announcement might be tomorrow, is that right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues who are managing that rollout for the precise details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But anyway, the Obama Foundation is actually sending out now missives and using social media to gather up support for what will be aggressive fundraising.\xc2\xa0 So can I just review in anticipation of the announcement of the library, the President does intend to participate in fundraising for the presidential library for the foundation, is that right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go and check on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the specific answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I do know that the foundation has indicated that they expect to live up to the commitments that the President made in the context of his campaign for disclosure and transparency when it comes to donations that they\xe2\x80\x99ll accept.\xc2\xa0 That includes not accepting donations while the President is in office from PACs or lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 And that also -- I think what they have also indicated is a commitment to disclosing with some regularity all donations above a $200- or $250-level. ** The President and the First Lady will not raise money for the foundation while still in office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then going forward to when there is a Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0 Because, for instance, Hillary Clinton is now using Priorities USA as a super PAC, will the President going forward headline any events to raise money for super PACs for the Democratic nominee, whoever that may be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t contemplated that question.\xc2\xa0 But we can get back to you if we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a policy decision on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you give us a little flavor of what the President is going to talk about at Georgetown tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is looking forward to the discussion that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have, that will be moderated by E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post.\xc2\xa0 And it will be an opportunity for the President, in the context of this ongoing conference at Georgetown University, to talk about what more we can do in this country to ensure that everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair shake; and making sure that the common-sense things that we can do to expand opportunity for everybody are things that we follow through on.\xc2\xa0 And whether that\'s raising the minimum wage, or ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality pre-K, or ensuring that the cost of a college education doesn\'t prevent an otherwise hardworking, talented student who wants to make sure that they\'re prepared for a 21st century global economy.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to discuss.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s all consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that the primary goal of the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic policy agenda is expanding opportunity for every single American.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been widely reported that several nations in the GCC would like to see a structured written statement coming out of Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s meetings about a security cooperation, maybe NATO-like.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House share the enthusiasm that that is something that should come out of this week\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview any of the potential deliverables out of the meeting, but I can tell you that the goal of the meeting is to have a robust and specific discussion about steps that can be taken to modernize and deepen the security cooperation between the United States and our GCC partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a snub that King Salman wasn\xe2\x80\x99t coming.\xc2\xa0 You said you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 More importantly, Saudi Arabia said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a snub.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as being disappointed.\xc2\xa0 Was the invitation then extended to him more or less out of courtesy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you specifically know that someone else from their group would be more appropriate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0 No, there was an invitation to Saudi Arabia to participate in the summit, and that was up to and including the King and his participation.\xc2\xa0 He initially committed to participating in the meeting and then informed us late on Friday evening that he would not be able to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat said, we continue to be pleased that the Crown Prince and the Deputy Crown Prince will both be in attendance.\xc2\xa0 I understand that there will be senior officials from the Saudi national security apparatus who will also be participating in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And, again, what we would like to see at the end of the day are representatives from these countries that can articulate the interests and point of view of their country in the meeting and follow through on any commitments that are made in the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that we have the appropriate level of representation from Saudi Arabia in the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing I want to ask you about -- Hillary Clinton said last week that she would like to expand -- and this is an immigration question -- that she\xe2\x80\x99d like to expand on something that the President said he had done as much as he could do in terms of the DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 She said she\xe2\x80\x99d like to see protections from deportation for the parents of so-called DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support that position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has said as a general matter that he strongly believes that we need to bring some greater accountability to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And the President announced some steps back in November that he believed were the extent of the executive authority that he could exercise to try to bring that much-needed accountability to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And there are aspects of that announcement that we have moved forward with implementing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are other aspects of that announcement that are currently ensnared in a legal dispute in the Fifth Circuit.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice is representing the interest of the administration and the federal government in that court proceeding, and we continue to have full confidence in the strength of the legal argument that they\xe2\x80\x99re making.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is as far as the President can go to this point is what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about exactly what legal authorities the President had vested in the office of the presidency to make changes to our immigration system in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with bringing greater accountability to that system.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe that that will have a positive impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 It will have a positive impact even on our budget deficit.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our values as a country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to follow on the GCC question, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that this is not the summit the President envisioned when he made the announcement that he invited the leaders in the Rose Garden?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would -- because, again, as it relates to the question that somebody asked earlier, the goal here was not a symbolic picture with the leaders of five other countries.\xc2\xa0 Frankly -- well, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is a more direct conversation, a substantive conversation about how to deepen and modernize our security relationship with those countries.\xc2\xa0 Are you smiling because I said \xe2\x80\x9cfrankly\xe2\x80\x9d and then started to say something else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t finish.\xc2\xa0 We were all looking forward to what you were going to say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s getting to be the end of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 We get a little --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a practical matter, does the -- the lower level of this meeting, should it also lower our expectations as we\xe2\x80\x99re covering it for what the President can or will announce at the end of it on Thursday because there are not leaders present who perhaps can sign off on some of the things that they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for and that you guys are asking for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you asking that question because I think that is ultimately what\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 We do believe that the representatives from each of these countries are at a sufficient level to sign off on the commitments that are made in the context of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 So we do believe that we will have the representation that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to have a robust, specific, detailed discussion about our security cooperation with each of these countries, and that any commitments that any of the countries make in the context of this discussion will be the kinds of commitments that they can follow through on because of the sufficient level of representation at the meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJerome.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 French President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande arrived in Cuba earlier today.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has expressed in the past his willingness to go to Cuba one day.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel it\xe2\x80\x99s too early for him to go?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is he waiting for a specific move or specific gesture from Raul Castro before going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is an ongoing diplomatic effort to try to normalize the relations between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 There is still some important diplomatic work that remains to be done.\xc2\xa0 The President did enjoy the opportunity that he had to have a pretty blunt and direct conversation with President Castro about additional steps that we need to see Cuba make to better reflecting a country that protects the universal human rights of its people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is a strong case that the President made in the context of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And there are lower-level discussions that are ongoing, both on the human rights issue but also on the range of other steps that we can take to try to normalize relations between our two countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the President has indicated that he does not envision a trip to Cuba anytime in the near future.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out over the course of the next year now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arctic drilling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just approved Arctic drilling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys just approved Arctic drilling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of that breaking news.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a big deal with environmentalists.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you just barked out Arctic drilling.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just -- (laughter) -- why don\xe2\x80\x99t we find out what the announcement is and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you with --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the announcement is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Viqueira, maybe you have a more fully formed question you\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was probably a better one.\xc2\xa0 I just want to close the loop, first of all, on this back-and-forth between symbolic.\xc2\xa0 You said that the Saudi -- that this is more than a symbolic summit.\xc2\xa0 The Saudis will have the proper people there.\xc2\xa0 Just so there\xe2\x80\x99s no misunderstanding, it would have been merely symbolic if the King had shown up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not saying that.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is that the President intends for this to be a working meeting.\xc2\xa0 And if the only thing we are concerned about was symbolism, then the only thing we would be focused on is whether or not the person with the highest-ranking title was in attendance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut because we\xe2\x80\x99re actually focused on some more specific details, we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in making sure that individuals who are participating in the meeting are individuals who are empowered and sufficiently equipped with the ability to represent the interest of their country and follow through on any commitments that they make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 In the Rose Garden, after the interim agreement was signed, the President at the end of his remarks spoke of the possibility of Iran joining the community of nations if it sticks by its obligations.\xc2\xa0 That sort of gets to the anxiety that many Gulf nations are feeling about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s role in the region.\xc2\xa0 That they look at the interim agreement and wonder if it is containment of Iran or d\xc3\xa9tente with Iran, and they worry that it\xe2\x80\x99s d\xc3\xa9tente with Iran.\xc2\xa0 Does the President understand those anxieties on the part of the Gulf nations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, he shares them.\xc2\xa0 The President has been pretty blunt about the fact that it is important for us to try to reach this diplomatic agreement that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 But we do not anticipate that these conversations are going to lead to a satisfactory resolution when it comes to the long list of bad behavior that Iran engages in.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Iran support terror groups around the world, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Iran engage in destabilizing activity, both in the region and around the world including in Yemen.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now, Iran has unjustly detained three or four Americans inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 We believe that those individuals should be released.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to harbor significant concerns about the anti-Semitic rhetoric that Iran uses to menace our closest ally in the region, Israel.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long list of concerns.\xc2\xa0 And in some ways, they serve to remind us of how important it is for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have these concerns even if a diplomatic agreement about their nuclear program can be reached.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we know is shared by our other partners and allies in the region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple more on the GCC summit very quickly.\xc2\xa0 The air campaign against the Houthis, as you mentioned, is obviously going to come up.\xc2\xa0 The United States has supported it with logistics and intelligence.\xc2\xa0 Has it been worth it?\xc2\xa0 Has it been successful?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for an updated assessment of that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Saudis and to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the goal of supporting that ongoing effort was to try to help Saudi Arabia resolve the security situation that they were concerned about along their southern border.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think that there are indications that have had a positive impact, but what we have said all along is the only way to completely resolve the security situation inside of Yemen is through a political dialogue that incorporates all parties.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have aggressively pushed all parties in this conflict to engage in that dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s facilitated by the United Nations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, evidentially the King of Bahrain is not coming to the summit as well.\xc2\xa0 Did he ever indicate, or did the Bahrainis ever indicate that he would be and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\'m not sure of the status of his invitation.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to follow up with you on that before Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Okay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:11 P.M.
