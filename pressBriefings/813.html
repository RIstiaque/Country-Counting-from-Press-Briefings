EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for joining us this morning here in Williamsburg, Virginia.\xc2\xa0 I have a brief statement to make at the top.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to say that the United States welcomes the adoption today by the European Union of significant new sanctions against the Iranian government in response to the Iranian government\xe2\x80\x99s continued violation of its international obligations regarding its nuclear program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis action, which includes additional sanctions in the financial, trade, energy and transport sectors, as well as additional designations on entities in the oil and gas industry, further strengthens international efforts to pressure and isolate the Iranian government for its continued refusal to comply with its international obligations and fully cooperate with the IAEA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, rallying the world to isolate Iran and increase the pressure on its leadership so that they stop pursuing a nuclear weapon has been a top priority for the President since the day he took office.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to that leadership, Iran is under more pressure than ever before.\xc2\xa0 The Iranian government is responsible for the state of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economy and the isolation of the country.\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have made conscious choices about how they manage their economy, how they prioritize their budget and how they respond to the concerns of their people.\xc2\xa0 The regime has chosen to spend money to pursue nuclear activities in violation of its international obligations, to support Bashar al-Assad\xe2\x80\x99s brutal regime, to enable terrorist acts around the world, and to undertake destabilizing activities around the region.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIran knows the kind of concrete steps we are looking for to bring it back into full compliance with its international nuclear obligations, to address the proposal tabled by the P5-plus-1, and to cooperate fully and transparently with the International Atomic Energy Agency.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of quick things that you may have seen but just to remind everyone.\xc2\xa0 We have a new TV spot out today, \xe2\x80\x9cMain Street,\xe2\x80\x9d that has average Americans discussing how the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies will help move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about 30 seconds, and I\'m just going to play it here -- since we all love visual aids -- if my iPad will do it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t(Video is played.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 As the President has been saying out on the campaign trail, you can expect him to continue to make the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done, but we\'ve come too far to come back -- to turn back now.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully he\'ll have the opportunity to make that case tomorrow evening.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a reminder, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created 5.2 million jobs in the last 31 months.\xc2\xa0 Consumer confidence is at a five-year high.\xc2\xa0 Foreclosures are at a five-year low.\xc2\xa0 This ad is running in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, Virginia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou also should have seen a memo in your in-boxes this morning just highlighting the fact the Mitt Romney will say and do anything, regardless of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true to become president. And no doubt over the last couple of days while he\xe2\x80\x99s been practicing and preparing for the debate he spent time memorizing deceptions and ways to hide from his \xe2\x80\x9cseverely conservative\xe2\x80\x9d record -- positions I should say.\xc2\xa0 So this is a translation guide of sorts for all of you and for people at home who are watching and can determine what he actually means by what he says tomorrow at the debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJust one final, third piece I wanted to flag -- a new report just came out from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation that finds that if Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plan had been in place -- if the Romney-Ryan plan, I should say, had been in place, 60 percent of seniors would have had to pay more today to get the same Medicare coverage.\xc2\xa0 And just a specific example that was of interest to us in there:\xc2\xa0 To get the same coverage, a senior in Miami, Florida would have had to pay more than $5,900 more because of their plan to voucherize Medicare.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, the ad is kind of a full embrace of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic record, which a lot of Republicans say is his biggest weakness.\xc2\xa0 How are you guys trying to balance what you see in terms of the public kind of slightly feeling better about the economy with the fact that you have millions of Americans that are still out of work?\xc2\xa0 How does he balance that, particularly in the debate tomorrow, when he\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking questions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard the President say out on the campaign trail, on the stump, in interviews, we need to do more.\xc2\xa0 And he has a plan to do more.\xc2\xa0 He makes the case at every opportunity he can to call on Congress to act on doing more to invest in infrastructure, doing more to help small businesses, doing more to help keep teachers employed. But we have made progress, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve come too far to turn back.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the fact is the American people in 21 days -- and many are already voting, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted before -- will be making a choice between two different plans, two different visions for the country.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the President would be happy to spend the entire debate talking about their different visions for the middle class tomorrow evening.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s that difference between, as he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out before, his plan that would extend tax cuts for the middle class, make sure health care for Americans is protected, give kids an opportunity to go to college -- and the Romney-Ryan plan that would extend tax cuts for the highest income, a $5 trillion tax cut package that would balance the burden on the backs of the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our message to the American people is:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way; we have a long way to go; we have a plan to do that, a better vision for the country moving forward, and we want -- the President is the one candidate who will fight for you if he\xe2\x80\x99s given another four years in the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I think one thing we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned, I can say as a matter of policy, is that consistently the American people are a lot smarter than some political entities give them credit for.\xc2\xa0 They know -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this reflected I think again and again in data -- that President Obama did not cause the recession that he inherited when he took office, the worst recession since the Great Depression and the worst recession in our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 They know how severe that crisis was, how deep the hole was that we needed to begin to climb out of.\xc2\xa0 And they understand that getting out of that hole will not -- is not an overnight project.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think if you look at how Americans view the recession and the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- stopping the decline and reversing it, they have a very sophisticated understanding of what happened and what we need to do to continue to move forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said consumer confidence is at a five-month [sic] high, foreclosure a five-year low.\xc2\xa0 We see today that retail sales increased more than expected last month.\xc2\xa0 And yet, with all this positive economic data, we\xe2\x80\x99re still seeing a tightening in the polls.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that means that impressions of the economy are now secondary in this election and that the changing perception of Romney after the last debate is having a greater impact on voters?\xc2\xa0 And how does that set up the stakes then for tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to unwrap some of those questions.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed this race would be close.\xc2\xa0 We believe and we think the middle class believe the more they learn about the plans the President has for the economy and the more they learn about Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plans -- or lack of plans -- for the middle class, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to choose the President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to -- continuing to make that case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we know this election is close because we know that many parts of this country continue to be divided.\xc2\xa0 We also know that the President is his own harshest critic and he knows that Mitt Romney had a better debate 10 days ago, 11 days -- however many days it was.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to answering questions from the American people tomorrow night, some that will be about the economy, some that will be about many other issues, and of course we have no control over that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I would say we know that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t sitting at their kitchen tables at home focused on pressing refresh on the BLS website or looking at economic data every day.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for the candidates to lay out their specific plans for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe feel we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to do that.\xc2\xa0 And we feel what the President has put out there is much stronger than what Mitt Romney has.\xc2\xa0 But we also know this country has been through a hard time and that we have to ask people and remind people that change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen overnight and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress, but we have a lot more to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the warning we have for people is that Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plans are -- would be dusting off the Bush playbook and going back to many of the policies that led to this crisis to begin with.\xc2\xa0 And those aren\'t the right options for this country or the right options for the middle class.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t know if I addressed every aspect of your question.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a report late last night or early this morning that the Obama campaign, in concert with the Romney campaign, has pressed to have Candy Crowley not ask follow-up questions at the debate tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Can you address sort of what the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s position is on the debate format and whether the moderator should be able to ask follow-up questions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There are discussions around every debate.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the specifics of those.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President is looking forward to the debate tomorrow night, looking forward to answering questions from the American people who will be in the audience.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared for and ready to take questions from wherever they come.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that sounds like a non-answer to that question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\'m saying is that I\'m not going to get into the specifics of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, this is a town hall, which means the questions will be coming from the American people in the audience.\xc2\xa0 But if questions come from other sources, he\'s happy to address those questions as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would the campaign prefer that follow-up questions not be asked?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into any more specifics than that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about the debate prep and just his weekend in general, and specifically what he did differently over the last couple of days from Nevada?\xc2\xa0 And then also, besides debate prep, what else has he done while he\xe2\x80\x99s here -- did he bring his golf clubs, briefings -- what else he\xe2\x80\x99s done with his time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I can take it from the campaign side.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we arrived Saturday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 He spent some time over the last 48 hours, I suppose, preparing with his team\xc2\xa0 -- that means studying, that means practicing.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he took some time yesterday to go visit a local campaign office and made calls with some volunteers there, and get them psyched up about the 21 days or 22 days we have left of the campaign.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOther than that, he spent a little time enjoying the grounds, walking around and taking in the beautiful atmosphere we have here.\xc2\xa0 But his focus has been on preparing for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 He\'s excited for it.\xc2\xa0 I know we\'ve all seen him a bit -- he\xe2\x80\x99s calm and energized and just looking forward to getting to New York tomorrow.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is also receiving, as he does every day, his presidential daily brief and getting updates from his policy advisors where appropriate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a question on the meningitis issue that sort of popped last week.\xc2\xa0 What steps does the President believe are necessary to keep this from happening again?\xc2\xa0 And what sort of involvement or interactions is he having on this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\'s been briefed on it and he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it and as concerned about it as you would expect, given the severity of the impact on some people who\xe2\x80\x99ve either died or have gotten very sick.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter obviously that the CDC and FDA are working on, so for more in terms of steps that might be taken I would refer to those agencies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he confident or pleased with how the CDC and the FDA have been handling it?\xc2\xa0 I guess there\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism of the FDA in particular.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him.\xc2\xa0 I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s fully aware of it and obviously wants to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the appropriate measures on a matter like this. But I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any policy specifics for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, you mentioned that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t do as well as Mitt Romney in the first debate.\xc2\xa0 Has he lost ground in the 10 or 11 days since the first debate?\xc2\xa0 And you talked about the race being close, but is it your sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s in the same place in the battleground states in the country as he was before Denver?\xc2\xa0 Or is he -- has the space between them grown or shrunk, or is he behind at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, you all see the same polls we see.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at them across the board, the state polls have been pretty stable for the past couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 We always expected that the polls would tighten, and some of them have.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the morning after the debate -- one of the reasons why, I should say -- the morning after the debate, the President is heading out to Colorado -- not Colorado -- to Iowa, to Ohio on Wednesday, to New Hampshire on Thursday, because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to compete for every last vote until the polls close.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we feel good about where we are in the race.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d rather be us than them because we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident in our ground game. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been organizing on the ground since the last campaign ended.\xc2\xa0 People are already voting in this country and have been for weeks, and we have a superior early voting program.\xc2\xa0 And we feel confident that when people look at the choice between the two candidates, that the President is offering a better choice for middle-class families, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote on when they go to the polls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that the debate helped your cause?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think the President himself has been pretty clear that Mitt Romney had a better night.\xc2\xa0 But people aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- people across this country aren\xe2\x80\x99t voting on who is the better salesman-in-chief.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re looking for who is going to represent them better in the White House; who is prepared to be Commander-in-Chief; who is going to fight for middle-class values and middle-class issues.\xc2\xa0 And we feel confident that the President is the superior choice on those -- by those gauges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jen, so Obama is down, obviously, for a couple days during this debate prep.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be down for a couple of days before the final debate.\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about what his campaigning is going to look like coming out of that third debate through Election Day?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see more events every day? Is he going to be hitting multiple states in one day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too ahead of where we are, just because we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the planning process as well.\xc2\xa0 I will say we\xe2\x80\x99re not taking a single vote for granted, and I would expect that the schedule for the last two weeks of the campaign will reflect that.\xc2\xa0 And that means we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to see as many voters as we can, and visit with as many American middle-class families across the country as we can.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as we have more details on where that is and what that means, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you guys have it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple questions from Ann Compton.\xc2\xa0 The \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes\xe2\x80\x9d ad where Romney was asked about the 14 percent tax rate, can you remind us what the President does propose in terms of capital gains tax increase?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s basically criticizing Romney for freezing the legal tax rate.\xc2\xa0 How would the President increase the capital gains rate?\xc2\xa0 Or is he just criticizing Romney for something the President has not proposed changing?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, secondly, the Ohio Attorney General has filed an emergency request with Justice Kagan to allow Ohio early voting three days early for civilian voters.\xc2\xa0 Does it matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So let me take the first one first.\xc2\xa0 The President and Mitt Romney have several differences when it comes to tax rates.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney wants to tax his own income at a lower rate -- he wants to lower the capital gains rate, I should say.\xc2\xa0 We want to return the capital gains rate to 20 percent for high-income taxpayers by rolling back the Bush tax cuts above $250,000.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also have a strong difference of opinion on the Buffett Rule -- something the President has strongly supported, Mitt Romney has opposed.\xc2\xa0 And I mentioned -- did I mention carried interest -- and how carried interest is taxed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a number of differences.\xc2\xa0 Also the President has named loopholes.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been clear about ending tax cuts for the highest income, been clear wants to end tax loopholes for, say, companies shipping jobs overseas, for the highest income, and Mitt Romney has failed to mention those.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of -- I think the differences are an ocean wide there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second question, on Ohio, can you repeat that one more time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The Ohio Attorney General has filed an emergency request with Justice Kagan to allow Ohio early voting three days early for civilians voters.\xc2\xa0 Does it matter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s always in the best interest of the American people to have -- for all eligible voters to have the opportunity to vote early if they can, and to make it flexible for people, given challenging work schedules and all the obligations everybody has in their daily lives.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been strong proponents of making sure that people in Ohio had access to early voting for those additional three days, which would be consistent with what the law has been.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBeyond that, I know this is an ongoing case and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure when the decision will be made.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a comment when it does.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been strong proponents of ensuring people have the opportunity to vote -- eligible people have the opportunity to vote and the access to vote and the information to vote.\xc2\xa0 And a big part of our focus in a lot of these key states has been making sure people are equipped with that information.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it absolutely does matter because people have all sorts of -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s taking your kids to soccer practice, or it\xe2\x80\x99s working a double shift, or it\xe2\x80\x99s helping your kids with your homework, providing more flexible hours is certainly something we see as a positive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You may not want to answer this, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try anyway.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, go for it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is debate prep different for a town hall than it is for a podium-to-podium debate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 You are right, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to answer that because -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say that of course, the debate prep team and the President are preparing for the format that will be the debate tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 His number-one goal tomorrow is to continue to lay out his vision for the American people for the next four years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this before but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning again, we fully understand the large audience of any debate and the people watching at home who may not have tuned in and may be tuning in, and certainly see that as an opportunity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I would -- you should expect that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be firm, but respectful in correcting the record in the times we expect Mitt Romney will hide from and distort his own policies.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s energized and I expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be making a passionate case.\xc2\xa0 But the audience is the people in the room, but also the people at home, and certainly he takes that into account in how he\xe2\x80\x99s preparing and looking ahead to tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say how it\xe2\x80\x99s going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, you heard him say it\xe2\x80\x99s going well.\xc2\xa0 I think it was good to get one debate under his belt, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s watched that back and looked at what he did well and maybe what he feels he could have done better.\xc2\xa0 And as I said before, he\xe2\x80\x99s his own harshest critic and that of course informs his preparations looking ahead to tomorrow as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Miami radio station interview, he said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 -- Nicki Minaj.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask about Nicki Minaj.\xc2\xa0 He had said if you read the transcript of the debate it came off better than if you probably had seen it on TV.\xc2\xa0 And he has referenced when -- his reactions maybe when he watched it on TV weren\xe2\x80\x99t as good.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, in the debate prep, are you guys videotaping his practice and is he going back and watching them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of that. I will say a great advantage that he has is that he feels fully comfortable with his policies and his record, and is happy to speak to them whether it\xe2\x80\x99s at the debate or to the people of Ohio and Iowa on Wednesday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMitt Romney has been clear he needs to and has a desire to hide from his \xe2\x80\x9cseverely conservative\xe2\x80\x9d record, positions he\xe2\x80\x99s been running on for months and years.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a little more difficult in that regard going to the debate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think the President has looked back at his past performance, as I said before, but he\xe2\x80\x99s really looking ahead and he\xe2\x80\x99s looking ahead to the performance tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 And even the day after the debate, last week or a week and a half ago, he was fired up in Wisconsin.\xc2\xa0 He was excited to see probably the 40,000 or 50,000 people we saw that day.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe know there are a lot of -- the American people are making their choice on a number of factors and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just who has the slickest sales pitch at the debates.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned -- I know you said you\xe2\x80\x99re not going into the specifics of debate prep, but is it the sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking it more seriously than the last time?\xc2\xa0 I know in Nevada he said that debate prep was a drag and they were making him study, kind of a joke -- I think.\xc2\xa0 But is he -- is his tone different? Is he approaching the debate, the prep and practice here, differently than he did in Las Vegas?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of the debate prep.\xc2\xa0 I would dispute the premise of your question, though.\xc2\xa0 The President takes every task seriously, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s preparing for a debate, or it\xe2\x80\x99s discussing the options for helping small businesses, or meeting with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 He was being honest that he\xe2\x80\x99d probably rather be outside enjoying the beautiful weather or walking around than maybe studying for a debate.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a pretty human response.\xc2\xa0 But he took every moment of the debate prep seriously the first time around; he\'s taking it seriously this time around.\xc2\xa0 I think he feels energized and calm, and he\xe2\x80\x99s really looking forward to it tomorrow evening.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a beautiful place.\xc2\xa0 You all have been staying here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With early voting taking place now, can you just talk a little bit about the stakes for tomorrow night, and people talk about debates historically not altering the outcomes in elections but since there\xe2\x80\x99s such an emphasis on early voting now, why that could be different?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the debates have a large audience.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very well aware of that.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons why they\'re such a great opportunity for the President to speak directly to the American people at home and lay out the choice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President, though -- that\'s not the only way he\'s communicating with the American people.\xc2\xa0 So he\'s going to be campaigning quite a bit this week.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously up in the air with ads across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think our view is the American people watching at home are looking for the choice between the candidates.\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking for, of course, their performance in part, but I think the advantage we feel he has is that his policies are ultimately better for the American people. And when they sit down and think about, well, would I rather have my Medicare voucherized, or would I rather have the plan the President is talking about, that if he has the opportunity to explain that, that\'s a plus for us.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo going into tomorrow night, his goal is to lay out the differences for the American people, do it in a forceful but respectful manner.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a number of questions from the audience; he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a number of opportunities to answer many questions.\xc2\xa0 But coming out of it, we think that the race is still going to be won or lost by who has the better policies and better plan for the middle class, who has the better ground game and better plans to encourage people and educate people to early vote and get them to the polls.\xc2\xa0 And we feel confident where we are on both fronts.\xc2\xa0 But we also feel good about where the President is going into tomorrow night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on the early voting, that this is taking place as voters are heading to the polls now.\xc2\xa0 For both Romney and the President, how does that make it all the more important that they come out of these debates the clear winner or clearly articulating that choice for voters?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- I don\'t want to overstate it.\xc2\xa0 I think every opportunity you have to speak to tens of millions of people about your vision for the future is a good opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And many people who are early voting may be watching at home.\xc2\xa0 Many of them may have already made their decision.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a factor in this as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is an important period of time in this election.\xc2\xa0 The last couple of weeks have been important periods of time in this election.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not the only factor that people early voting are making their choice on.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in a state like Ohio, I\'ll take, the President has been there making the case for the importance of early voting, making the case for why people should go to the polls on multiple occasions over the past couple of weeks and speaking directly to them in their backyards.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow is another opportunity to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut he hasn\'t wasted one moment making the case for early voting or making the case for why people should go to the polls. So it\'s one factor and it\'s a big audience, but certainly not the only factor in how people are making their decisions for early voting.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, I just got an email from Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Oh, you did?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I did.\xc2\xa0 He says that this race is tied.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like we hear two different things from you guys.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend on all the Sunday shows, we just kept hearing about you guys have an advantage in the battleground states, which implies that you\xe2\x80\x99re winning.\xc2\xa0 And now Obama is telling people he wants to get money from that the race is tied.\xc2\xa0 Is that just kind of a fundraising tactic?\xc2\xa0 Or where do you guys really see this?\xc2\xa0 Is it tied, or do you have an edge?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very, very close.\xc2\xa0 And there are some states where we are up by a few points; there are some states where we\xe2\x80\x99re down by a few points.\xc2\xa0 And across the country nationally you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of the polls -- which we pay far less attention to, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated many times -- those show the race very close, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the sum is where everybody -- we\xe2\x80\x99re all on the same page here is this race is very close.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s tightened, which we fully expected to happen.\xc2\xa0 And has always been the case, the President, Jim Messina, David Axelrod, David Plouffe, whomever it is feels it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remind the American people that we have a long way to go here.\xc2\xa0 We need everybody to register, everybody to get out to the polls.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the message that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately sending.\xc2\xa0 And we need every last dollar to make sure we can compete against not only our Republican opponent but the special interest money coming in still from the super PACs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I -- not speaking for the campaign, but speaking for him, because he said this in an interview after the debate, that the fundamentals of the race still give us an advantage, give him an advantage.\xc2\xa0 And I think so both are consistent, that it is essentially tied, but some of the underlying fundamentals of the race give the President a slight advantage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would point to those fundamentals to make sure that you understand they include policy.\xc2\xa0 Overwhelmingly, when Americans are presented with policy options that are on the table here with regards to the economy, to Medicare, to energy, education, the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is supported far more broadly than the vision put forward by his opponents.\xc2\xa0 And I think those fundamentals matter a great deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch the Nationals game Friday night?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where was he?\xc2\xa0 Where were we Friday night?\xc2\xa0 I have spoken with him about the game, about the enormous pain I felt as if my heart had been torn out and stomped on, on the sidewalk at that terrible loss.\xc2\xa0 And he sympathized with me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe did comment last night on the restoration of faith in Washington sports teams created by RG III\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable performance in the Redskins game, which he was aware of, as well, having seen a few highlights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He was at dinner with his last contest winner, Dinner with Barack Obama, on Friday evening, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he watched it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a late game, but I don\'t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- getting to Nats Stadium?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 Did you go to the game?\xc2\xa0 Terrible.\xc2\xa0 My son -- I made him go to bed because it was such a late game, and the first thing he said when he got up in the morning was, did they win?\xc2\xa0 It was very hard.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:19 A.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
