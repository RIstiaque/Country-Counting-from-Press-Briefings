ICT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We are very fortunate to be joined by the Secretary of State, who is going to give us an update on the President\'s visit after day two of three, here in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 He\'s also going to offer some personal reflections on what this trip has meant and the progress we\'ve seen, I\'d say, in the years since you\'ve led this effort a few decades ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\'m going to turn it over to Secretary Kerry, who will have time for just a few questions.\xc2\xa0 And then Ben and I will stick around for a few extra questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY KERRY:\xc2\xa0 Eric, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Sorry to sidetrack there for a minute.</p>\n<p>\n\tGood evening, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s really a pleasure for me to be here with all of you, but it\'s also a tremendous privilege to be here with President Obama on what is unquestionably an historic demarcation effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI have to tell you that for many years I have looked forward to a time when people would hear the word "Vietnam" or the name "Vietnam" and think more of a country than a conflict.\xc2\xa0 And with President Obama\'s visit this week, with the crowds that we saw along the street today, the remarkably warm and generous welcome, the unbelievable excitement of people that we are here with a President of the United States at this moment is absolutely palpable, and I think it is a demarcation point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, clearly, we will never fail to honor the sacrifice of those who fought here and of what their dreams were for this country.\xc2\xa0 But I think one can say genuinely, definitively, without failing to honor past service, that we have reached a new point in our relationship now.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will tell you that when I first came over here around 1990 or so, not that many Americans had traveled at that point in time officially, from the government of the United States certainly.\xc2\xa0 And in Hanoi, there literally were very few cars.\xc2\xa0 None of the street lights worked.\xc2\xa0 People were still in black pajamas.\xc2\xa0 There was a law that said they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to foreigners.\xc2\xa0 And the embargo was in full force.\xc2\xa0 There were just bicycles, massive numbers of bicycles and people riding to work.\xc2\xa0 Very few hotels in the city.\xc2\xa0 I stayed in a government guesthouse.\xc2\xa0 And the transition from that moment -- when America decided we were going to sort of start to become engaged -- until now is nothing less than stunning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a country that is practicing a raging form of capitalism.\xc2\xa0 It is engaged and has been called the tiger of this region.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, by every measure, this is a significant emphasis on the policy of President Obama with respect to the rebalance to Asia.\xc2\xa0 This is a prime example of the way in which the United States has been able to forge a new relationship out of the ashes of war and to create real peace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when people ask what does it mean to have lifted the lethal weapons ban -- what it means is it\'s normal.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have lethal embargoes or bans for countries that we treat normally.\xc2\xa0 And after 20 years of recognition, it is time to honor that normality.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that it is also a very important decision in terms of making certain that Vietnam has the equipment that it needs in order to be able to defend itself and to stand up as part of ASEAN, as part of a rule of law, a rules-based structure -- which is what President Obama has been trying to seek both in TPP, as well as in our overall policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this visit and this moment, in my judgement, reaffirms what has been clear for some period of time to many of us:\xc2\xa0 The United States and Vietnam no longer define our relationship by the enmities of a bygone era.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I often point out that the young adults of America and Vietnam were both born after normal relations were established 20 years ago, and what was extraordinary to my generation could not be more routine or natural to them.\xc2\xa0 And all you have to do is look and measure this transformation that has taken place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTwenty years ago, there were fewer than 60,000 American visitors to Vietnam on an annual basis; today, there\'s nearly half a million.\xc2\xa0 Twenty years ago, bilateral trade in goods was only $450 million; today, it\'s more than $45 billion a year.\xc2\xa0 Twenty years ago, there were fewer than 800 Vietnamese students studying in the United States; today, nearly 19,000.\xc2\xa0 And through the Lower Mekong Initiative -- a place that I know well -- we are working to improve Vietnam\'s resilience to the effects of climate change, focusing our aid on clean energy and the development of sustainable infrastructure and ecosystem resource management.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re also working together, excitingly, in the academic arena.\xc2\xa0 And I can\'t emphasize how key that is in terms of transformational long-term impact of a relationship.\xc2\xa0 The Institute of International Education, Arizona State University, Harvard Medical School, the University of Hawaii all have partnerships with institutions in Vietnam, several involving participation by the private sector.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow, I will have the privilege of launching the formal launch of Fulbright University Vietnam, which will be a full-fledged, non-profit and totally academically free institution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur two countries are also cooperating on security issues -- something that none of us could have imagined 45, 50 years ago.\xc2\xa0 Our Coast Guards and our Navies are working together.\xc2\xa0 Vietnam is a partner in America\'s Global Peace Operations Initiative.\xc2\xa0 In 2014, Vietnam began contributing to U.N. peace operations in a small way, but with plans to send engineering, medical, and other specialized units in the future.\xc2\xa0 And along with allies and partners, the United States is helping personnel from Vietnam to prepare for those deployments.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things we did in the course of this visit is sign an agreement which will permit the pre-deployment of supplies in the event of emergency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me just emphasize that measure this visit alone, major business agreements -- Pratt &amp; Whitney, Boeing, wind energy, the Fulbright University, the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam, the Mekong Delta Initiative, Fulbright University, TPP\xc2\xa0 -- it seems to me that that alone, without all the other things I added, defines rebalance impact and a relationship that is really nothing less than transformational.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there is no question, as the President said earlier today, that our government and the government in Hanoi continue to have differences, obviously.\xc2\xa0 The fact that we are cooperating in all of these other areas doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there is a sudden erasing of fundamental differences in how we organize our governments, how we deal directly with our citizens.\xc2\xa0 And so the good news, however, is we\'re talking about that.\xc2\xa0 We talk about that very directly.\xc2\xa0 We talked about it today.\xc2\xa0 We talked about it yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd today, you saw the President meet with some folks in their civil society -- people who represented disabilities, people who represented church, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 That could not have been imagined 20 years ago.\xc2\xa0 That meeting today, while it lacked three people that had been invited and we hoped had been there, was still a remarkably significant meeting because it took place. And that\'s the first time a President of the United States sat down with civil society in the capital of this country and talked in an open way as he did today.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is clear that we and Vietnam are engaged today in a way I can tell you that none of us could have imagined during the war. And it is clear that Vietnam is reaching towards this globalized world of modernity.\xc2\xa0 After all, millions of people in Vietnam already freely use -- I think it\'s something like 38 million people and some 29 million or so under the age of 25 who use Facebook.\xc2\xa0 So thousands of Vietnamese workers are already freely associating to defend their interests.\xc2\xa0 And under TPP, those rights will be increased, as well as environmental protection.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the Vietnamese are the ones who are asking for the guarantees of a government to put into law the recognition of their freedoms.\xc2\xa0 And there will be, shortly, an effort within the parliament to codify certain rights in ways that are reflected in the constitution of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the more progress that occurs in those areas, the more likely it is -- as President Obama explained very clearly -- the more likely it is that our bilateral relationship, which has already come so far, is going to be able to reach even greater potential.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re here.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why this is significant.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I think this is worth the fight.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I am happy to open it up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 The China Daily is warning the United States not to spark a fire in Asia.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m quoting now:\xc2\xa0 "The United States and Vietnam must not spark a regional tinderbox" -- noting the concerns of trying to curb the rise of China.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to what the China Daily has written? And if I could follow, based on what you\'ve observed in the time since 1990, is there any doubt in your mind that there will be an even greater openness here in Vietnam in the years to come?\xc2\xa0 And how can you manage that as a country that still has so many fundamental differences between governments?</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY KERRY:\xc2\xa0 Between -- I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. and Vietnam.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY KERRY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 Last year -- I mean, they released -- I\'m going to take the second part of your question first.\xc2\xa0 They released a number of prisoners.\xc2\xa0 They had about 160, I think; 60 or so were released. There had been increased freedoms of worship.\xc2\xa0 The church has been recognized.\xc2\xa0 Handicapped efforts have been recognized.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s some progress.\xc2\xa0 Is it as much progress as we want?\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 And there is going to be a journey ahead of us while we continue to work on those things.\xc2\xa0 But I really think that\'s at the center of President Obama\'s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing in Burma.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing in Iraq and in other places, Afghanistan, where transformation is taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\tFolks, I got to tell you, we are impatient by nature, and that\'s good.\xc2\xa0 We get a lot done in America because we are impatient.\xc2\xa0 But you can\'t be impatient -- you can be impatient, but you\'ve got to also recognize the time it takes for cultural transformation, for generational transformation, for people to be able to learn how to manage and exercise rights and certain freedoms.\xc2\xa0 And we went through that ourselves.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how can we turn away from our own history?\xc2\xa0 It was only in the 1960s, when I was in college, that we began the battle -- or the next evolution of the battle to have full voting rights in America and full civil rights, and Jim Crow.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so long ago in our history, for a country that began with the Constitution we began with.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for countries that don\xe2\x80\x99t begin with that, or don\xe2\x80\x99t have any of that tradition, we have to recognize that road that they\'re on is going to be a roller coaster ride to some degree.\xc2\xa0 But as long as it\'s moving in the same direction, that\'s what is important.\xc2\xa0 As long as the United States itself remains faithful to our values and we are always pushing in the right direction, as the President did today, I think we can absolutely look forward with confidence to this transformation taking hold.</p>\n<p>\n\tI personally, I do not know how -- I mean, I was sitting on the Commerce Committee of the Senate when we rewrote the rules for telecommunications.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think about information management.\xc2\xa0 And this was 1996.\xc2\xa0 Look at where we are 20 years later in our own revolution in terms of that technology and communication.\xc2\xa0 I came into a Senate that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an Internet, and look at where we are.\xc2\xa0 So life changes, and it will change here -- because you cannot function in the modern, globalized marketplace of today without opening up ultimately, and without being able to be competitive in terms of purchase, sales, communications, and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, on the first part of your question about China, I\'d say several things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is not about China.\xc2\xa0 Nothing that we did here or are doing here is focused on China.\xc2\xa0 It is focused on the fastest-growing marketplace in the world.\xc2\xa0 It is focused on a rules-based order that we have consistently -- Republican and Democrat, President alike -- held at the center of our policies.\xc2\xa0 And it is focused on strengthening the ability in this region to be able to promote that rules-based order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, part of that rules-based order, frankly, requires the peaceful resolution of the problems of the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 We have consistently urged in private conversations and public conversation with China that they respect the rule of law and that they engage diplomatically with the countries that are contesting claims and that they not move unilaterally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you want to point to the possibilities of tinderbox and of perhaps igniting something, I would caution China, as President Obama and others have, to not unilaterally move to engage in reclamation activities and militarization of islands and areas that are part of the claims that are in contest today. We don\xe2\x80\x99t take a position on those claims.\xc2\xa0 China should note that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not saying China is wrong in its claims; we\'re simply saying, resolve it peacefully, resolve it through a rules-based structure.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo nothing we\'ve done here is out of the ordinary.\xc2\xa0 We have lifted an embargo, which was out of the ordinary.\xc2\xa0 The embargo itself, the lethal arms embargo, was a restraint on normality.\xc2\xa0 Now we have a normal relation, so we lift it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s very normal.\xc2\xa0 Not out of order, and certainly not inflammatory.\xc2\xa0 And I hope China will read this correctly, because our hope is for normal respect for maritime law and for the relationships that are so key in this region in terms of resolving the code of conduct and moving forward in a diplomatic way to resolve these differences.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry, while we have you, on another topic -- the battle against ISIS and terrorism.\xc2\xa0 So what extent now, when you look at the Egypt air crash, is the thinking that this was or was not an act of terrorism?\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hearing a lot about the battle for Fallujah beginning.\xc2\xa0 How do you see that playing out? How long is that going to take?\xc2\xa0 Why now?\xc2\xa0 And do you think this is really -- there\'s been a lot said about how the administration has turned the tide in this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY KERRY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information -- particularly on the road like this, I just have no way of authoritatively commenting at all on the EgyptAir crash.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen catches of the news, and I\'m reading what people are reading.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\'s my job to surmise.\xc2\xa0 I think that has too many consequences.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s let the investigators investigate and let them do what they\'re doing, and we\'ll see where we are.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to ISIS, what Fallujah means is that we\'re continuing the process that President Obama has put in play to defeat ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to defeat them.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said that again and again.\xc2\xa0 And I think I\'ve been backed up week to week by the increased efforts that we are seeing be successful -- with communities in Iraq being returned to their inhabitants, with ISIS being compressed in its area of activity, though it is still lethal.\xc2\xa0 We know that.\xc2\xa0 And we see them lashing out, to some degree, because they\'re not able to take territory.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not able to mount lasting holding actions.\xc2\xa0 They can attack and move, and that\'s still dangerous, and we see them with suicide attacks, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, that will continue, as we continue to press the battle against them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think what Fallujah means is that our generals and our cooperation with the Iraqis and with the full coalition of 66 countries have a clear strategy.\xc2\xa0 They\'re moving very systematically.\xc2\xa0 And I believe we\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 And the President has instructed all of us to try to think about ways in which we could accelerate that, for obvious reasons.\xc2\xa0 The faster we can eliminate Daesh as a threat force, the better off the world would be, because it has impacts on economies, it has impacts on travel, it has an impact on the threat and safety.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s the President\'s instructions to us, and that\'s what we\'re trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you said that this is not about China. But it\'s hard not to see many of the President\'s comments:\xc2\xa0 "Big nations should not bully smaller ones."\xc2\xa0 "Vietnam is an independent and sovereign nation, and no other nation can impose its will on you."\xc2\xa0 These were all big lines that got a lot of applause today, and they got a lot of applause because the audience clearly understood that the President was talking about China and Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 And so huge parts of this trip are clearly directed at pushing back on China, both in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to be going to Japan.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to talk about proliferation.\xc2\xa0 In this region, the most important proliferation problem is in North Korea, which is Chinese technology gotten through Pakistan, and China has the most leverage in the North Korea situation.\xc2\xa0 So again and again -- even TPP is a trade organization that you all have sort set up without China, in the Pacific.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s hard not to see each one of the things that you\'re talking about, the speeches that you\'re making -- and even now you\'re talking about you immediately pivot to the South China Sea -- without seeing China being a huge part of this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tSECRETARY KERRY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\'s happening is you\'re confusing, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my saying so, respectfully, the focus and the direction of what we\'re doing versus some of the impact, collaterally, of what we do.\xc2\xa0 I\'d obviously be either misleading you or pretty stupid if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that order in the South China Sea and encouraging peaceful resolution and making sure that ASEAN is strong doesn\xe2\x80\x99t collaterally have an impact on perceptions there.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s not focused on China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama could not have been more clear.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve said it a hundred times -- and we mean it:\xc2\xa0 We welcome the rise of a strong China, a China that assumes responsibilities as a global superpower leader, and plays out its responsibilities in ways that are helpful.\xc2\xa0 And that means encouraging peace and stability.\xc2\xa0 As long as China is playing by those rules and adopting it, none of this is focused on China.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s really something we have worked on in our country and stood for since World War II.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve been working on this rules-based structure, freedom of navigation, codes of conduct, peaceful resolution, diplomatic process.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the hallmark of American policy for throughout the Cold War and beyond.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s not specifically focused on China.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there is a collateral impact to the degree China chooses to do X, Y or Z.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re very clear -- we encourage China not to be unilaterally militarizing, unilaterally moving.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not focused on China.\xc2\xa0 I just can\'t say it enough.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on this region.\xc2\xa0 And I think the primary threat of the entire region is North Korea, Kim Jong-un, and the proliferation activities of the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the primary threat.\xc2\xa0 It\'s actually perhaps the lead threat globally with respect to one of the two or three currently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think these guys are going to take over here.\xc2\xa0 I answered more than I thought I was doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.\xc2\xa0 Good to see you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Ben and I are your second act and happy to take any remaining questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tNancy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, did the administration push back at all -- with the activists that who were denied access to the meeting this morning -- with the Vietnamese government, register a protest or anything?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that when the President travels around the world, he meets with government and he meets with civil society.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve done that here in Vietnam. \xc2\xa0We\'ve done it in Cuba.\xc2\xa0 We did it in Myanmar.\xc2\xa0 We did it in Ethiopia.\xc2\xa0 And we set up a similar meeting here.\xc2\xa0 This morning -- or overnight, really, we learned that there were a number of individuals who were being prevented from, or dissuaded from attending the meeting with the President.\xc2\xa0 We protested to the government.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately we were able to meet with the group of people that the President had this morning, which included advocates around issues like freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, disability rights, freedom of worship.\xc2\xa0 But there were a number of individuals who were not able to attend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No, I think the Secretary identified the number of people.\xc2\xa0 What I\'d say, though, is number one, as Secretary Kerry pointed out, the fact of an American President or any head of state or government meeting with independent civil society in Hanoi is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And so, clearly, this was something that was a source of significant discomfort for the government.\xc2\xa0 And that alone I think demonstrates that we\'re able, through this relationship, to hear from different voices and to lift up these different issues. And I think certainly the President benefited from this conversation today, and made the point that we\'re going to continue to remain engaged with civil society.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo the second point I\'d make, going forward, even as we are elevating this relationship in a host of ways -- our security cooperation, our commercial ties, our people-to-people ties -- clearly human rights is going to continue to be on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s part of what we wanted to demonstrate today, that we\'re not beyond all of our differences, we\'re going to continue to raise them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then the final point I\'d make on this is we believe very strongly that we are going to be better-positioned to advance human rights through a policy of engagement; that if we were to withhold the relationship with the United States and try to use the fact of cooperation in different areas to pressure the government to do certain things, we would be less able to, over time, encourage positive reform than if we\'re here and we\'re engaged.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you look at the transformation that\'s taking place here that Secretary Kerry talked about, that includes things that are very empowering like the ability for people to have access to Facebook, like the enormous interconnectivity that you have between young people here and young people across the region and around the world.\xc2\xa0 The opening that takes place is creating a space for discussion and debate and dialogue that is new.\xc2\xa0 And as the Secretary said, we\'ve seen some progress in recent years, but certainly not sufficient progress.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to press the government on all those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add one thing for Nancy, which is the President, I think it\'s noteworthy, chose to raise this in front of all of you -- meaning he thinks it\'s significant enough to make sure that all of you knew about this.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s indicative of the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to press on this and make it a priority moving forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night, during his speech to the Vietnamese people, he seemed to be approaching this extremely delicately.\xc2\xa0 Given that this had just happened, and given that just yesterday the BBC was told by the government to stop reporting -- I mean, it\'s kind of happening boldly while he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 But he approached the whole thing by first talking about the problems that were in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\'s how he opened the discussion.\xc2\xa0 And then he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get very specific or critical in any way.\xc2\xa0 He just said -- he kind of extolled the virtues of certain freedoms in a general sense.\xc2\xa0 It seemed like he was much harder on the subject and more specific in places like Kenya, for example.\xc2\xa0 Was there a reason he had to approach this so delicately?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a consistent way in which the President raises these issues anywhere -- Cuba, Vietnam, Kenya.\xc2\xa0 He discusses what we stand for, what we believe, and the universal values that he thinks that all people should be able to have access to, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think he was speaking delicately in any way.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn fact, that speech was broadcast here in Vietnam, and those are not things that people in Vietnam hear frequently.\xc2\xa0 They do not hear leaders of the stature of President Obama discussing those values openly in Hanoi with that kind of platform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, look, we have a very complicated history in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s important that the President make clear here that we recognize that history and we\'re not coming here to impose a system of government on Vietnam, but rather we\'re coming here to engage the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 And part of that engagement is going to be advocacy around these issues.\xc2\xa0 And people know what we stand for.\xc2\xa0 They know that we raise individual human rights cases.\xc2\xa0 They know that we advocate for the types of reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see here.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor instance, if you look at TPP, a main sticking point here in Vietnam was the fact that in order to come into TPP they had to allow for independent labor unions; they had to allow for fair wages; they had to allow for limitations on workers\xe2\x80\x99 hours.\xc2\xa0 Those are human rights advances that were embedded with TPP.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how engagement allows us to advance the types of reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the last thing I\'d say about this, Michelle, is Vietnam is not going to change its political system overnight, and it\'s not going to change its political system because we tell them to. What\xe2\x80\x99s going to ultimately bring greater change and reform to Vietnam is the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve already seen that progress take place in the last two decades, during normalization.\xc2\xa0 In some ways, we\'ve seen it accelerate in recent years as people are more connected and expect more of their government.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen laws pass that begin to address issues of human rights, including the ability of people to protest their detention.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately we\'d like to see laws pass that address issues like freedom of speech and assembly.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\'s going to take time for Vietnam to evolve.\xc2\xa0 But the final thing I\'d say about this is, I think the Vietnamese people know what the President stands for.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the reception that he got in Hanoi and the reception that he got coming into Ho Chi Minh City, I\'ve traveled all over the world with President Obama, and other than Myanmar, I can\'t think of another country that received him like that.\xc2\xa0 And those are people who know exactly what he stands for and believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s helping the Vietnamese people achieve a better future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another question on about Navy access here in Vietnam. We just got back from the Philippines, involved in exercises, and we have now the ability to access five bases in the Philippines we gave up in 1991.\xc2\xa0 Now we\'re back in.\xc2\xa0 Another one is the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 Many of the allies we\'ve got are giving us more access to bases and use for the Navy.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in Vietnam?\xc2\xa0 When and how, and how big?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I obviously don\'t want to compare the relationship that we have with the Philippines, a treaty ally, to Vietnam. \xc2\xa0What I would say is we are deepening our cooperation with Vietnam in a number of areas.\xc2\xa0 One of those includes maritime security and having discussions around how we can help enhance their capability with respect to maritime security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve also had conversations about disaster response and how we can perhaps pre-position certain resources that can make Vietnam more effective in working with other ASEAN partners in responding to natural disasters.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, going forward, as we consider the relationship between the United States Nave and Vietnam, that\'s going to be an evolving conversation.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to discussions related to what types of cooperation we might pursue, what types of port calls there may be, I think that\'s going to be an unfolding process in the coming months and years.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, by deepening our collaboration with Vietnam and with ASEAN, by removing this vestige of the Cold War with the lethal arms ban, we\'re able to have a conversation with Vietnam like we have with other countries within ASEAN, and we expect them to be an important partner of the United States just like we\'ve been deepening cooperation with other ASEAN countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We have time for one or two more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can you tell us if you got any specific commitment on this trip from the Vietnamese government on human rights, and whether that leverage, specifically when it comes to weapons, is gone?\xc2\xa0 Or is this like a case-by-case basis -- every time they ask for another piece of policing equipment, we have a conversation with them about freedom of assembly?\xc2\xa0 How does that work?\xc2\xa0 And can you also give us your read on the level of instability in North Korea, given that the Secretary just said it\'s the lead global threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, on North Korea, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to the fact of their nuclear program and that they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly the leading threat as it relates to nuclear proliferation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to commitments, yes, the government did indicate to us that it was committed to pursuing additional reforms in this space.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that involves the implementation of laws that have been passed that allow for more rights.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, they were referencing individuals who we have raised with them.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases, they were referring to upcoming legislative efforts that they might pursue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s a broad discussion around the trajectory of progress here in Vietnam that focused both on individual human rights cases of concern -- like Father L\xc3\xbd who was released the other day -- but also legal reform that codifies certain rights, like the ability of people to protest their detention, seek greater transparency from the government, seek the right to assemble, seek the ability to have a civil society that is independent of the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this will be an ongoing conversation.\xc2\xa0 The government indicates to us that they are moving in a direction on a number of these issues.\xc2\xa0 We will wait and see whether or not they follow through on those commitments.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t define this relationship as a strict quid pro quo as it relates to our engagement as against specific steps.\xc2\xa0 But what they certainly understand is the ability of us to cooperate depends upon continued progress on a range of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so just as TPP requires them to fulfill their labor commitments -- because if they are not allowing for the registration of independent labor unions, and if they\xe2\x80\x99re not allowing for the types of workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights that are codified in TPP, they won\'t get the benefits of TPP, because TPP is enforceable.\xc2\xa0 So they have to do those things, they have to implement those laws in order to get those protections lifted and have the market access that comes with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an indication of how a broadening relationship maintains the ability for us to raise human rights concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the lethal weapons ban, we have now lifted the prohibition on the sale of weapons.\xc2\xa0 But as with any other country, we do review each weapons sale on a case-by-case basis. So it will continue to be the case that as we are considering certain arms sales to Vietnam we will look at a variety of factors, and it\'s certainly going to be the case if our administration, Congress, future administrations, I\'m sure, will look at the trajectory of the human rights picture in Vietnam as they make those decisions.\xc2\xa0 So that continues to be the case going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we believe that, broadly speaking, what we\'ve done through normalization with Vietnam is empowering the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 And it is ultimately leading to a future where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have greater rights and opportunities, and that we can push that process forward much more effectively by deepening the relationship than by pulling back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any other -- to be free?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99ve released a number of prisoners over the last year.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see an additional number of political prisoners released.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to make predictions about specific cases.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s fair to say, here, as in other countries in this part of the world, we are regularly raising through human rights dialogue and other channels, including on this visit, cases that are of concern to us.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some light on the pushback related to last night, such as who was involved and what the Vietnamese government\xe2\x80\x99s response was?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, the President said a number of times that the United States is demonstrating its commitment to fully normalizing relations.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what is left to do to fully normalize relations?\xc2\xa0 Is it just a matter of implementing decisions that have already been made, or are there additional policy decisions that need to be made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as we became aware of individuals who were facing obstacles in attending the meeting we raised those concerns at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was certainly involved in those efforts, as were people in the White House.\xc2\xa0 This is something that we\'ve done in many countries.\xc2\xa0 We faced obstacles and concerns around participants in those types of meetings in other countries, and we raised them through the White House and through the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, we were not able to have every participant at this meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I do want to be very clear that we have to use or engagement as a means of raising these issues.\xc2\xa0 If the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pursuing this policy, he wouldn\'t be sitting in Hanoi with a series of civil society and human rights activists talking about these issue and talking about them publicly, and giving a speech about it that reached the Vietnamese people.\xc2\xa0 So if we just stayed in Washington and expressed our concerns we\xe2\x80\x99d never have the opportunity to have that type of conversation.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a conversation that has never taken place before in Hanoi -- which is precisely why the government was so uncomfortable with it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we deeply believe that by being engaged, by coming here, we are having a conversation that would not otherwise happen.\xc2\xa0 We are able to hear the voices of those civil society activists.\xc2\xa0 That gives a greater platform to their ideas, just as we\'re able to engage with and hear the ideas of the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you look at the Vietnamese people, again, if our focus is on how are we helping the Vietnamese people, there are few countries in the world where the United States is as highly regarded as here in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 You see that in every public opinion survey; you see it on the streets here today.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a testament to the fact that the Vietnamese believe this relationship benefits them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say what it was that did to -- were they physically arrested and hauled off to jail?\xc2\xa0 Was it house arrest? Warned?\xc2\xa0 And to the best of your knowledge now, are they free to move about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, Matt, I would just say that there are a variety of ways in which governments seek to make clear to people that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attend a certain meeting.\xc2\xa0 I personally am not familiar enough with each individual case, I think, to be able to give an accurate rendering that I know to be completely true.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is that, using a variety of different methods, a number of people felt either prevented from or uncomfortable attending the meeting.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama volunteered that to the press because he wanted people to know that not everybody who was invited was able to attend.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will certainly be following up and have followed up to make sure that all of those individuals are free and they\xe2\x80\x99re not being in any way subject to any punishment.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s something that our embassy does on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals who are regular sources of information to not just the United States but to advocates on these issues around the world.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who have the courage, frankly, to take those positions.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who assume the hardship of staking out positions that may put them on the other side of the government here.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what our commitment is, is, number one, that we\'re going to engage them just as we engage the government as part of normalization.\xc2\xa0 Number two, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to raise these issues privately with the government.\xc2\xa0 And number three, that President Obama discusses these issues publicly as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, the public engagement that we have here should not be underestimated.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about a Fulbright University opening, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first independently accredited university that has the ability to exercise a freedom of academic pursuits that is not subject to government restrictions.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about our exchange programs, that\xe2\x80\x99s connecting people from Vietnam to other countries and to the United States, and we have 12,000 people participating in that exchange program.\xc2\xa0 So there are all kinds of ways that we are able to demonstrate our commitment to universal values, including advocacy on individual cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Carol asked about normalizing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have, I think, in many ways removed many of the vestiges of the past as it relates to Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 The prohibition on lethal arms sales was certainly a vestige of the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, the Vietnamese agreement to allow the Peace Corps to come here I think demonstrates on their side that they are putting behind a vestige of the Cold War.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, having a normal relationship with another country does not necessarily define the extent to which your partnership develops.\xc2\xa0 So, for instance, we were discussing earlier our military and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We are at a nascent stage of that collaboration.\xc2\xa0 As we develop a closer relationship with Vietnam and as we look at all of the different factors in our relationship, I think that will have a bearing on just how close the collaboration is between our militaries on a variety of issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, again, as I said on TPP, as they implement their commitments, that will have a direct bearing on how much they are able to benefit from the agreement, assuming it\xe2\x80\x99s approved by the respective parliaments and our Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, we have, I think, removed the barriers to this relationship, but at the same time, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t established just how far it can evolve.\xc2\xa0 And at the end of the day, we always have the closest relationships with countries with whom we share broad interests and a shared set of values.\xc2\xa0 And as this relationship evolves, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how far it can go.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, as Secretary Kerry said, if you look at how far it\xe2\x80\x99s come in just the last 20 years, it suggests that there\xe2\x80\x99s enormous potential here in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 And look, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I know we\xe2\x80\x99re spending a lot of time, as we appropriately should be, discussing the very serious differences between our governments, but it is worth stepping back and reflecting on just how extraordinary it is, given the history between our two countries, given the war, that you have a U.S. President received as he\xe2\x80\x99s been by both the government and people of Vietnam on this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is different from many other countries around the world when you look at the history.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we are able to be where we are today with Vietnam in terms of our commercial ties, our security ties, our people-to-people ties, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the fact that countries get more out of pursuing peaceful cooperation than they do out of conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s take one more.\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that, Eric.\xc2\xa0 Ben, I probably speak for a lot of people in the room who are looking for you to sort of unpack some of the comments that you made in that Times Magazine article, in particular when you said \xe2\x80\x9cThe average reporter we talk to is 27 years old, and their only experience consists of being on the political campaigns.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a sea change. They literally know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that struck a lot of people as a curious statement by you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if I could follow, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been accused of misleading the timeline as far as the negotiations were concerned on the Iran nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 It was also suggested that you were promoting a narrative that the administration was dealing with moderates when in fact, it was all along dealing with hardliners.\xc2\xa0 If you could clarify that, I\'d appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed this at least in part, but I don\'t think I\'ve had a chance to engage you personally or have you comment on these things on camera.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, on the second question, many of you saw the Medium post I wrote after the article came out.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you all covered the Iran deal for many years.\xc2\xa0 At no point did I say in that article that there was any false narrative as it relates to the Iranian hardliners and moderates.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think if we review the facts, they\xe2\x80\x99re very clear.\xc2\xa0 We had wanted to pursue an Iranian nuclear deal for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 President Obama campaigned on that platform.\xc2\xa0 I went to work for him in the summer of 2007, when he was having a debate in the Democratic primary about whether to pursue diplomacy with Iran.\xc2\xa0 So that was no secret.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is we pursued several efforts to make progress on nuclear negotiations in the first term, some of them quite public, and they did not go anywhere.\xc2\xa0 It is also true that we were able to establish that we could have a discreet channel of communication with the Iranians through Oman during the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term.\xc2\xa0 However, those discussions did not go anywhere.\xc2\xa0 They were not substantive.\xc2\xa0 They did not in any way foresee the deal that was ultimately reached.\xc2\xa0 All it was, was our ability to establish that we could have a discussion with the Iranians, which we were already having in other forums, like the P5+1.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this was dead in the water in our first term.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why we spent so much time imposing sanctions on Iran, because we did not see a change in the position of the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also undeniably true that that changed after the election of Hassan Rouhani.\xc2\xa0 And what happened after President Rouhani was elected is that President Obama wrote him a letter and indicated that we wanted to pursue a dialogue on nuclear issues.\xc2\xa0 Very quickly, that led to the negotiations that began in secret between the United States and Iran in the summer leading to the fall of 2013, and then very quickly moved into the P5+1 negotiations that were launched at the U.N. General Assembly in New York in 2013.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there may be a debate that is I think a very important debate about the degree of moderation of different elements of the Iranian leadership -- the difference between a Qasem Soleimani or President Rouhani, for instance, in their respective views of Iranian foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Some people may not want to apply the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d to anybody in Iran, given their continued violation of international norms and support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, President Rouhani, Foreign Minister Zarif approached the nuclear issue in a different way, in a way that was more moderate than the previous regime under President Ahmadinejad.\xc2\xa0 And we were able to get a nuclear deal because there was a different regime and different administration in Tehran.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with respect to the timeline, we have always been absolutely clear about the timeline of our interest in an Iranian nuclear deal and how it unfolded.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, the areas of that timeline that remained secret for some time have long ago since been publicly discussed, including our talks in Oman.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important -- I know, while there\xe2\x80\x99s debate on the Iranian issue as it relates to the article, that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said at podiums like this for years is what I would say to any of you, which is that there was a sea change after the election of President Rouhani.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we agree with everything that he does.\xc2\xa0 There continue to be ballistic missile launches.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 There continues to be threats to Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut on the specific question of the nuclear deal, we did have an administration under President Rouhani that was different from the administration of President Ahmadinejad.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s just -- anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s covered this issue and looked at it closely would find that to be the case, irrespective of other views of Iranian actions or U.S. policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the first question, all I\xe2\x80\x99d say is, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this job for over seven years.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with some of you for that entire time or part of that time.\xc2\xa0 I think that you all know how much I take seriously our responsibility to engage with you and to try to communicate our policies on very complicated and difficult issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take bits of quotes that were pulled out of different places and get into a media commentary here.\xc2\xa0 I addressed this the other day and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something similar here today, which is simply that I think those of you who have worked with me know how much I respect the role of the media in what we do, how much, even if I might disagree with you, I want you to understand where we\xe2\x80\x99re coming from and what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to accomplish, and, frankly, how much I enjoy being on trips just like this and talking about issues like this remarkable transformation in our relationship with Vietnam.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I just think that the people who know me and have worked with me know exactly how I approach these issues, how I think about my responsibilities and my engagement with you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that I really have enjoyed for the last seven and a half years and will enjoy doing for the next several months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did you or did you not say that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
