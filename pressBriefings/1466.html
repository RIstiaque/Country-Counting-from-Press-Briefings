EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll try to do this quickly so we can get to afternoon meetings with the Joint Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 But let me start out with giving you guys a quick rundown of the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Saturday, tomorrow, the First Family will welcome more than 2,000 local area children from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia schools, and their families for trick-or-treating at the North Portico for Halloween.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the President and First Lady and the Vice President and Dr. Biden will host a Halloween reception for military families and children of White House and White House residence staff.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are they coming as?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All sorts of things.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time is that, roughly?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s 7:00 tomorrow night.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to dress up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not been told the First Family is going to dress up, but I will endeavor to check.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a denial, then?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage on it?\xc2\xa0 Pool?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if there\'s pool or not, to be honest with you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just walk up to the front door, ring the bell and say, "trick or treat."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are not invited?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can\'t -- you\'re a little old for this I think; I\'m just saying.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sunday the President will travel to Camden and Newark, New Jersey, to attend rallies for Governor Corzine.\xc2\xa0 On Monday the President will attend the second quarterly meeting of the President\'s Economic Recovery Advisory Board here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday morning the President will meet, as we announced yesterday, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany -- again, here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Later the President will meet with His Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew here as well.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon the President will participate in the U.S.-European Union Summit with the Prime Minister of Sweden, Frederik Reinfeldt, President of the European Commission Jos\xc3\xa9 Manuel Barroso, and the European Council High Representative Javier Solana.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday the President will participate in a credentialing ceremony for foreign ambassadors.\xc2\xa0 Later he will travel to Madison, Wisconsin to discuss strengthening America\'s education system.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Thursday the President will host the White House Tribal Nations Conference.\xc2\xa0 The event will be held at the Department of Interior and each of the 564 federally recognized tribes has been invited to send a representative.\xc2\xa0 The President will deliver opening and closing remarks at the ceremony.\xc2\xa0 And in the afternoon the President will meet with President Ian Khama of Botswana here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only guidance for Friday is that the President will attend meetings here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller, take us away.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A few questions on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think it was appropriate for Secretary Clinton to be as blunt as she was towards Pakistan in the comments she made about Pakistan\'s unwillingness to find terrorists within their borders?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\'ve been in ongoing conversations with the Pakistanis about ways that they can address and go after violent extremists in their country that threaten both Pakistan and the United States.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t -- I think the remarks were completely appropriate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think they were completely appropriate?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mm-hmm.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no chance of that undermining the effort going on here for a new strategy or revamped strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0 You talk a lot about partnerships, but then you have those -- that kind of sort of calling out of a partner.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously in those relationships, we expect that both sides, I think -- both sides would expect the others working constructively to address concerns in that relationship.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the United States has great concern about extremists in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to -- continue to discuss with them what can be done.\xc2\xa0 And those remarks were appropriate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting today -- which one are we up to now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Seventh.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seventh?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That sounds right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the -- how would you frame the mission and the expectations for today\'s meeting, from the President\'s perspective?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, the President asked to meet with the Joint Chiefs, the second time he\'s met with them as a group.\xc2\xa0 The first time was, I think, in the first month of the administration.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, these are folks that represent all branches of our armed forces, and I think we\'ll -- the President wants an opportunity to talk to them about General McChrystal\'s assessment.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\'re -- being in charge of their branch, these are the men who are required to provide trained and equipped soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen for missions both in Afghanistan, Iraq and throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they talking about specific troop numbers today, Robert?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\'re going to go through -- we\'ll go through the region and talk about General McChrystal\'s assessment, and as we talk about the assessment I\'m sure the resource request will be part of that discussion.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the American people hear the White House say that the recovery package has created 650,000 jobs, a million jobs -- first of all, could you explain the difference between the claim of 650,000 and the million jobs?\xc2\xa0 And second of all --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me start with that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- 640,329, based on the reportable data from projects that have been funded through September 30th by the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 The data that we received back was to measure direct job impact from that project money, right?\xc2\xa0 So the direct jobs in that is, again, 640,329.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The statistics do not measure indirect jobs that may be created through those projects.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s take an example.\xc2\xa0 If we fund a road project and, Jake, you\'re hired to help lay the pavement on a new widening of an interstate, what\'s not counted is whether Bill gets -- his job gets saved at the asphalt plant that produces the material that ultimately is used in that project.\xc2\xa0 The figures also don\'t include money that has gone out through tax cuts and other parts of the bill that are not examined in this report.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the 640,329 directly saved or created -- right, saved or created?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How credible should the American people consider these numbers, given that in many cases they\'re rough estimates and there has been some reporting problems in the past?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there were -- there was a reporting problem with one of the contracting numbers because that paperwork went up quite quickly.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve had a chance to go through the numbers over the past couple weeks and address any confusion or errors.\xc2\xa0 This is paperwork directly from a project that money has been appropriated for.\xc2\xa0 So I think the American people can have confidence in it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The -- and then switching subjects for one second, the President signed a homeland security appropriations bill that contained a provision allowing the Secretary of Defense to block the release not only of these other detainee abuse photographs but other ones that -- future ones that may exist.\xc2\xa0 How is that consistent with the promise of transparency?\xc2\xa0 Not so much the decision the President already announced about those specific detainee abuse photographs, but this kind of blanket power that is now vested in the Secretary of Defense?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the blanket power is based on the Secretary of Defense telling the Commander-in-Chief that the release of these photos would threaten the safety and security of American soldiers.\xc2\xa0 I doubt seriously that Secretary Gates -- I know that Secretary Gates won\'t -- and I would assume that any future Secretary of Defense is not going to abuse that privilege.\xc2\xa0 To say to somebody that the release of this would harm our men and women who are protecting our freedom is not a -- not something that you would trigger lightly.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s narrowly written to assure that our men and women are protected, just as incidents like this are investigated.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I am hard-pressed to imagine any Secretary of Defense approving the release of the Abu Ghraib photographs because releasing those photographs, any general would argue, put American lives at risk, and yet it can also be argued that releasing those photographs stopped a horrific pattern of abuse that was going on at American prisons throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 So if this law had been in effect back then --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I have not heard Secretary Gates make this argument.\xc2\xa0 I think going backwards into a big hypothetical is --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to explain why it is that so many people feel like --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a blanket protection is blanket ability to just cover up any --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let\'s talk about the protection going forward rather than generalizing in many ways about something that you haven\'t had a discussion with the Secretary of Defense about in the past.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But President Obama has just given Secretary Gates power that did not exist before to block the release of any prisoner abuse photographers.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That -- hold on, hold on, well, let\'s -- let\'s make this -- not just block any prisoner photographs.\xc2\xa0 Block prisoner photographs that the Secretary of Defense has deemed threatens the safety of men and women in our uniform.\xc2\xa0 So let\'s broaden the -- let\'s make sure we understand what the definition is.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t -- this is -- this is a trigger that the Secretary of Defense has to determine and that -- before it can be triggered.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me put it this way.\xc2\xa0 Let me ask this -- ask it this way.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama think the release of the Abu Ghraib photographs put American lives at risk?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\'re going back into a generalization of hypotheticals.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is what you\'re giving -- this is what the President just gave his Secretary of Defense the power to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about those specific photos, nor have I talked to Secretary Gates about those specific photos.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s an unrealistic fear that people might have, that of the -- if a similar circumstance were to present itself, the judgment might come down against releasing, which in the eyes of many people had a remedial effect on that very problem?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This administration takes seriously, I think, based on what we have released publicly, detainee abuse and the conditions with which detainees are held -- right?\xc2\xa0 We\'ve taken a lot of grief for that.\xc2\xa0 But what the President determined is that we are not going to put, through that, our men and women in harm if the Secretary of Defense determines that something like that could do that -- just as the regional commanders communicated to the Secretary of Defense that\'s what these type of photos could do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Major, I\'m -- again, I\'m happy to talk to the Secretary of Defense about this, but I would not want to generalize, going back, by using the word "could" so many times.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you -- do you think that the stimulus is doing what you expected to do up to this point, or did you expect more jobs to be saved or created?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\'re on track with what we estimated would likely happen.\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday\'s figures denote that we have seen a growth in our economy, particularly if you look at -- well, we haven\'t had a growth like we had in the previous quarter in more than two years.\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t had any positive economic growth in more than a year.\xc2\xa0 So I think for those that have said the stimulus or the recovery plan aren\'t working, you\'re hard-pressed to back that statement up with the figures that have come out in the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the number of jobs, the 640,000 saved or created --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Direct jobs for the 47 percent that was required to be examined by the independent board through this date.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is that where the administration saw it at this point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, when you\'re sort of looking --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s approximately -- the million jobs saved or created has us on track to where we thought we\'d be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then back to the meeting again today -- so one of the questions that\'s being looked at is -- with these military leaders -- do you have the personnel to potentially match 40,000 going into Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that force strength, the health of the force, is certainly a topic that will come up.\xc2\xa0 Their views on the assessment will come up.\xc2\xa0 What I mentioned, which is I think also what your network is reporting, that\'s statutorily what the Joint Chiefs have purview over.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you maintaining that the figure of a million, more or less, jobs is reached by counting the indirect jobs that flow off the 600-and-some-odd thousand?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think through a combination of the indirect jobs as well as the percentage of the act that has not -- that is not measured through this report, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your own material yesterday suggested that it was a percentage not yet measured, the half of the money not yet spent, or at least not recorded.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there\'s about 47 percent of the total number is examined by law in this report.\xc2\xa0 This report --again, required by the statute -- measures direct jobs from these -- from projects.\xc2\xa0 It does not count money that goes from tax cuts, money that would go from other -- or go to recipients through other safety networks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re making these jobs that you say have been counted so carefully sound like a scientific, actual -- a number that can be observed scientifically.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At 3:00 p.m. you\'ll be able to observe it holistically on your computer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Each one of these so-called saved or created jobs represents a concrete new job or saved job?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or two part-time jobs, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or two part-time jobs?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your critics don\'t believe that it\'s possible to count anything like that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our critics didn\'t think the recovery plan would help the economy grow, but I think the critics -- if you put 50 cents in the newspaper machine and pull the arm, you\'ll see that our critics haven\'t been so right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seventy-five cents.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s a dollar for --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Seventy-five -- well -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where are you buying your papers?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t worry, there\'s a payment that goes along with that for the recovery plan to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just keep buying.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look it up online.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jeff has had nothing to say during this interplay, so we\'ll -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>I\'m sorry, Helen, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Do what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And many others.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A fellow Nobel, Krugman, who is a columnist with the New York Times.\xc2\xa0 He said -- he said conservatives don\'t want Americans to have universal health care, and they don\'t want the President to succeed.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that report?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Helen, the President has said on a number of occasions that he does think some of his critics in Congress on health care have decided that they want to play a political game rather than one that addresses the problem that we\'ve dealt with for decades, and that is health insurance reform, absolutely.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\'t he go after them, then?\xc2\xa0 Call them what they are?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has done quite a bit of that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been happening throughout this process.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few things.\xc2\xa0 One, is it fair to say the strategic review in Afghanistan is winding down?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is nearing its -- I think it\'s nearing its conclusion, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen -- I\'ve gotten --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Everybody has got to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I\'ve gotten a couple questions today about whether -- people have stated that this is the last meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the last meeting, is that correct?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have certainly not been told that it\'s the last meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s on other meetings scheduled?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not currently.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there likely to be one next week?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There could be, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, it seems as if there are reports that the deal that the negotiators agreed to, as far as on nuclear fuel, has been nixed by the government itself.\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that the Iranian government is not negotiating in good faith?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have yet to see, and we await the details of their response to the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the same reports you have, but we have yet to see a detailed response --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When do you expect this detailed response?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are in constant contact with the IAEA in order to get that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a -- I mean, is the President going to say, you know what, if we don\'t get it here, then we\'re going to think about the next step here, we\'re going to think about sanctions, or we\'re going to do something else?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that the President\'s time is not unlimited.\xc2\xa0 This was not about talking for the sake of talking.\xc2\xa0 This was about reaching an agreement that just a few weeks ago seemed to be something that the Iranians wanted.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On H1N1, is there anything that you guys, looking back, could have done differently to have sped up this vaccine?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say I think we have -- the numbers that I got earlier today I think there are now 26.2, I believe, million doses that are now -- have been now made available.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there was supposed to be over a hundred million.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, we have -- obviously had problems in the delivery of the vaccine from manufacturers.\xc2\xa0 The 26.2 million, though, is 3 million more than we had just two days ago.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\'s accurate to say the President has been and is frustrated with ensuring that this vaccine is delivered on time, and won\'t be satisfied until those that want to be vaccinated from HIN1 have the opportunity through the vaccine to do so.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything the government could have done differently?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we have -- the manufacturer -- the manufacturing of the vaccine, which certainly takes about six to nine months, in this case is taking closer to six months.\xc2\xa0 But it hasn\'t been as fast as we were told, or as fast as we had hoped.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll continue -- I know that John Brennan and others meet daily on this topic to ensure that we have the vaccine that we need as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a mistake believing the private sector on this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we certainly had hoped that their predictions on this would be correct.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Is General Jones\'s trip to Russia, to Moscow, a sign that the negotiations on the START follow-on treaty are on schedule, or that they are at some kind of impasse?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, General Jones is back from that trip today and will participate in the meeting this afternoon in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 We think the talks are progressing as we had hoped for a treaty that expires the 5th of December.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you think you\'ll make that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We believe so, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And anything more on the meeting of the President\'s Economic Recovery Advisory Board?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a topic that I can -- we can see if there is a little bit more detail going forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, do you have an estimate of what the cost per job of those 640,000 would be?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t and I think the economists would tell you, Mark, that there\'s still investment in those jobs that is being made.\xc2\xa0 The projects -- I think on the form there\'s a part that denotes that there\'s still a certain amount of investment in this project that\'s yet to be spent out.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not sure you can make a one-to-one math conclusion on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President has begun reading or intends to read the House health care bill?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, but I can ask.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is anyone in the White House reading it, all 2,000 pages of it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All 1,990 -- I can assure you there are many people that are studying it, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said that the President\'s decision on Afghanistan would be weeks away.\xc2\xa0 Is that still correct and are you still sticking with that?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that he will not be deciding it before he leaves for Asia on November 11th?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t gotten any greater guidance than a week, so I\'ll stick with that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before, during, or after?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can narrow it down to either before, during, or after.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would still be coming after the election, though, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It certainly could come earlier, but I don\'t anticipate that it would.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New Jersey election or the Afghan election?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assumed Afghan, but a fairly good question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the record, I was asking about the Afghan election.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 Let the record reflect.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up Chuck\'s question on H1N1.\xc2\xa0 With whom or what is the President frustrated with about the vaccine?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is frustrated that all those who want to be vaccinated thus far haven\'t had an opportunity to do so.\xc2\xa0 We had hoped that the vaccine would, as we had been told, be here faster.\xc2\xa0 It has not.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that, and the team believe, they\'re making progress.\xc2\xa0 I noted that there\'s 3 million additional doses of the vaccine than there were just two days ago.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re working with state and local authorities to ensure that there are -- all that can be done is being done to ensure the speedy delivery of that vaccine.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a bureaucratic breakdown or a vaccine production breakdown?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- I think right now -- again, we\'d hoped that what the manufacturer had said in terms of getting the vaccine here earlier would have been true.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on the election question --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The New Jersey one or the Afghan?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New Jersey one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\'s been reported that the President\'s pollster, Joel Benenson, is taking an active role in Governor Corzine\'s campaign.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he works for him.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Does that in any way elevate the stakes for the White House in that election or in Tuesday\'s results generally?\xc2\xa0 Do you see anything coming out of results Tuesday that could assist or in any way undermine what the White House is trying to accomplish legislatively on Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on Joel\'s participation in New Jersey?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Based on whatever election results.\xc2\xa0 There is some speculation if Corzine doesn\'t win, things don\'t work out for Creigh Deeds, Bill Owens doesn\'t win in New York 23, it could put a damper on things for the White House in a political environment where people are suddenly nervous about maybe short-term political prospects as opposed to larger legislation aims the White House is pushing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we continue to take the long view on what\'s going on in Washington and throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have time to dissect whatever those results are on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think it portends -- quite honestly, whatever the results are I don\'t think they portend a lot in dealing with the future.\xc2\xa0 I saw that somebody -- I think somebody had mentioned that if you lost either governorship it would impact -- in 2001, if I\'m not mistaken, in Virginia and New Jersey, a Democrat won in either one of those, I don\'t think anybody thought that when they looked at the election results in 2002 they thought that President Bush was significantly hampered by that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple Recovery Act questions.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the 643,000 jobs --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Six hundred forty thousand, three hundred and twenty-nine.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Directly created.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roughly that\'s at a pace of about 80,000 per month.\xc2\xa0 If you single out since the act was signed on February 17th, not counting February but counting the months since -- would that be a fair --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I trust your math --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- but other than that, I can\'t speak to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet on a monthly basis, about 500,000 or more Americans are filing first-time unemployment, for benefit claims.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say this.\xc2\xa0 We\'re happy it\'s not 580,000.\xc2\xa0 Right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ll take what you created?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is obviously not satisfied that anybody that wants to find a job in this country can\'t.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of people that that applies to, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 But I think we saw through GDP growth a positive improvement that we think is the beginning of better things.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that if you can look at this plan and say, without it we would have lost -- you would have had 80,000 additional people every month applying for unemployment benefits, yes.\xc2\xa0 Not only are you not paying out those unemployment benefits, but that person has a job.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s actually a good way of discussing the multiplier effect, indirectly, of jobs saved or created.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one on stimulus, then I\'ll let it go, I promise.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden just said a moment ago that all of the GDP growth, or virtually all of it, can be attributed to Recovery Act spending.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of it, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we were discussing with you the Edmunds.com situation yesterday, you pointed to 1.66 percent of that 3.5 percent GDP growth as attributable to car sales --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Cash for Clunkers.\xc2\xa0 Now, Jared has told me that your analysis for the stimulus and its economic benefits doesn\'t count Cash for Clunkers spending.\xc2\xa0 It only counts Recovery Act spending.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, the analysis for today?\xc2\xa0 Yes, because as you -- Jared will tell you, as I would too, that Cash for Clunkers was funded out of a separately --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is, how do we reconcile these two?\xc2\xa0 If Cash for Clunkers was 1.66 of the 3.5, and all the Recovery Act spending is responsible for the 3.5 GDP growth, I don\'t see how those two things can both be true.\xc2\xa0 If the Recovery Act is responsible for all of the 3.5 GDP growth --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\'s what -- let me go back to what you said a minute ago --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Cash for Clunkers was responsible for half of that --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If we didn\'t have the GDP -- if we didn\'t have the Recovery Act, our GDP would probably be, what, somewhere near flat, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what you say, okay, right.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s how I\'d measure it.\xc2\xa0 Without it, we would be basically middling along.\xc2\xa0 We, through the Recovery Act, have seen positive economic growth, and that\'s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but yesterday you said in defense of Cash for Clunkers almost half of the 3.5 percent GDP growth was attributable to Cash for Clunkers.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just the figures based on the GDP itself, yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not Recovery Act spending.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\'s not Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 It\'s part of the plan that the President has put forward in order to help the economy grow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if half the GDP number didn\'t -- is Cash for Clunkers, how can it be -- I\'m still trying to figure out how the Recovery Act can be responsible for all the 3.5 percent GDP number --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go back and look at the math figures on this.\xc2\xa0 I think what\'s undeniable, Major, is that the recovery plan is helping the economy grow, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, so am I.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What did you come to the conclusion?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It may be 3.5, it may be -- the difference between 3.5 and what 1.66 --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is the economy growing for the first time --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- which you said was attributable to Cash for Clunkers.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is the economy growing for the first time in a year, based on your assessment of the figures?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we get a blackboard in here, please?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get some math teachers as well.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And some coffee.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m just tired.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was anything but boring.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, settle down.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What exactly has the President taken away from all these meetings that he\'s had?\xc2\xa0 This is the seventh one he\'s had, today.\xc2\xa0 If you could shed some light on what he\'s -- how he\'s processing this, how he\'s keeping this -- what does he talk with his other advisors about after he comes out of these meetings?\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, have you decided -- and how will you have him explain this to the American people?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the second one.\xc2\xa0 We have not, in all honestly, had extensive conversations about that yet.\xc2\xa0 I do believe, without getting into specifics, I think the President strongly believes that it\'s important for the American people and for the international community to know his reasoning behind whatever decision he makes, and to clearly explain our goals and objectives in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, and the region as a whole.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I anticipate that whatever form it ultimately takes, the President will use the occasion to explain some of that to the American people so that they understand his decision-making and his thought process.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A TV address or something, to the nation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we haven\'t gotten into broad specifics on that yet.</p>\n<p>On the first part, Jeff, you know, look, I think -- I don\'t -- I used to have it calculated, I should just go back and do it, the number of hours that he has spent in these meetings is probably now -- well, at the end of today will probably be getting close to 20 direct hours of his time.\xc2\xa0 The group -- the principals that meet with the President additionally take time to get the material ready, and are prepared to answer questions for the President, probably at least twice as much of that of the President\'s time the principals have spent.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously we -- the President and his team have spent a pretty big chunk of time evaluating very, very closely each of these individual countries, their relationship together and their impact on the region.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of these meetings, he generally is off to the next thing.\xc2\xa0 I think he has spent quite a bit of time after the meetings back in the office -- back in his office, probably primarily in the Residence at night, going back and reading through his notes, as well as -- notes that he\'s taken on the meetings, and oftentimes will come out with questions that the team will prepare the answers for, for the next meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, if possible, how have these seven meetings not created the need for an eighth and a ninth and a tenth?\xc2\xa0 At what point does he stop these meetings, announce a decision, and fine-tune after that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President has certainly told all of us that we were going to go through an extensive and exhaustive review, but Jeff, I can assure you that he knows and the team know that you cannot and we will not meet in perpetuity on this.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that we\'re still -- we\'re still assessing the information that he needs to make that final decision.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just briefly to follow on that, there was a report that he\'d asked for a problems-by-problems breakdown of the Afghan leadership.\xc2\xa0 Are there other outstanding things like that that he still wants to come back to him to -- before he can make a decision?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what that list would be.\xc2\xa0 That certainly, as was talked about in the Post, was something that the President had asked be created because in all honesty, less because it had anything to do with resource requests for those individual provinces, but as we wind down our commitment ultimately in Afghanistan, we\'re going to have to transfer the security, the economic development, the civilian nature, the governmental function both in Kabul and throughout the country to entities in Kabul and in these provinces.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants, as we\'re beginning or as we\'re going through this assessment, to begin to think about what structures are in place and what structures have to be strengthened in order to eventually transfer that core responsibility to Kabul and provincial government.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understanding that, are there any other things that he\'s asked --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that -- nothing that come to mind right away, but maybe there may be some stuff today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Early yesterday morning when he was in Dover and met with the families, the families said that he asked, is there anything we can do for the families.\xc2\xa0 And the mother of -- Dona Griffin, a mother of the last of the dignified transfers, said that she told the President, "Don\'t leave our troops hanging."\xc2\xa0 When he walks into the Situation Room right about now, does he have any sense that the time he\'s taking to make these decisions is leaving those troops hanging?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, to go back through what\'s happened, the President believed that additional forces were needed in March and he added them to get us to a point where we could evaluate the outcome of the election.\xc2\xa0 That obviously has been delayed a little bit, but he believes this is a point in which it\'s necessary to fully assess where we are.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the President thinks -- I know he doesn\'t believe that this assessment is in any way doing that.\xc2\xa0 I think he understands and I think, as you heard him say yesterday in the Oval Office, I think his commitment, particularly after going to a place like Dover, is to understand the full cost of the war.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he think when -- how did he respond when she said --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about the individual comments that -- conversations that he had with the families.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go this meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President rooting for the Phillies or the Yankees?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that one.\xc2\xa0 Probably I would -- I\'ll say I think the Phillies because of Plouffe, but I don\'t know the answer.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he watching the World Series?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I was going to ask you India is on -- India is on high red alert and --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This would be a long answer so I got to run to this meeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Have a nice weekend.</p>\n<p>END</p>\n<p>1:34 P.M.
