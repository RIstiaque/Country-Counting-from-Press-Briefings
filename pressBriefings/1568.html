EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How are you guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 Fire away.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think the Iranian election was run fairly and that the announced results are accurate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a lot to add to what -- the statement that we put out this weekend and what Vice President Biden said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we continue to have concern about what we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Iranians are looking into this, as well.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be heartened by the enthusiasm of young people in Iran.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think what\'s important is the concerns that we have about their nuclear weapons program, and the concern we have about their support for terror isn\xe2\x80\x99t any different than it was on Friday.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the margin of victory announced for Ahmadinejad seem reasonable or plausible to the White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of factors that give us some concern about what we\'ve seen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President open to including changes to medical malpractice rules as part of a health care overhaul this year?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that\'s going to be something that needs to be addressed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he will -- as I told many people, he will mention this as part of the speech today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a very small, short part of the speech.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t specifics.\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion that somehow -- if you thought this was a speech on medical malpractice, you would -- that would be wrong.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- take away from the fact that it\'s a small part of the speech that he is not as committed to malpractice reform as he is to other things?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 This isn\'t a med mal speech and that\'s not what he\'s come to talk about today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aside from the speech, is he open to the idea of setting caps on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'ll see from the speech what he\'s going to talk about today.\xc2\xa0 The President, as a member of the Senate, worked on a number of different proposals that can bring relief from the cost of medical malpractice that don\'t necessarily involve that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s he going to tell the trial lawyers?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 About?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About medical malpractice reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The same thing he tells the doctors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- are skeptical.\xc2\xa0 A lot of these guys I talked to over the weekend at the AMA are very skeptical.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the victory today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how does -- what does he take away from his push today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is about talking to the doctors, but also talking to the American people.\xc2\xa0 I think you can understand, having covered politics, as well as all of you can, things get said in public to maintain your negotiating leverage, and things get worked on in a large table to make progress.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'re very enthusiastic about where we are in this process. I think the President will outline a strong case that health care reform is not only necessary and needed but can\'t wait.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t wait for the millions of people that are being crushed by skyrocketing health care costs.\xc2\xa0 Our federal budget deficit can\'t wait as Medicare and Medicaid -- the costs of Medicare and Medicaid skyrocket.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think he\'ll outline the case for necessary and needed reforms.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this is just part of the process.\xc2\xa0 We understand, as I said, what some people may say in public is different than what we see as progress toward real reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there something in it for the doctors?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think you\'re not -- understand that health care reform is not just something that the President sees as a phrase or a hope.\xc2\xa0 The goal is -- and I\'m sure -- I know doctors share this, too -- doctors want to practice medicine, right?\xc2\xa0 They don\'t want to be insurance administrators.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t want to spend a huge portion of their time filling out forms.\xc2\xa0 They want to treat patients; they want to provide the best quality of coverage; they want to do so in a way that\'s affordable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why people get into practicing medicine.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are all goals that are shared by the President.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Why do we as a country spend twice as much per capita as some countries do on outcomes that aren\'t as good?\xc2\xa0 I think those are concerns that are shared by both entities, both the President and doctors.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'re optimistic that health care reform is truly possible this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to push members of his own party about medical malpractice reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to push members of both parties on all aspects of what it\'s going to take to get reform through Congress and to his desk this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Director Panetta\'s assessment that Vice President -- former Vice President Cheney almost wants another attack to happen?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to get into motivations.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what our business is.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s concern is keeping the American people safe.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had policy disagreements, but I think what is true for anybody is doing what\'s -- doing what we need to to keep the American people safe and secure.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the President is working on every day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The AMA said last week that they were not against all kinds of public plans, but some kinds.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to go into some detail today about what he sees as sort of a workable public plan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President will obviously talk, as he did last week in Green Bay, about the benefits of choice and competition; the need to ensure that there is an affordable option for those that are getting the opportunity to get affordable health care.\xc2\xa0 The President has always seen that as an important part of reform.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what -- the case that he\'ll outline today, making sure that we have a public option that gives people greater choice, that brings competition to the insurance market is one that I think the President believes quite strongly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to get to that point?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of different ways to get to all these points.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why you heard the President in the campaign talk about having a big table with lots of chairs.\xc2\xa0 I think this is another stop on the big table tour.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that, when the doctors are saying that a public health program will run private insurers out of business, does the President agree with that assessment?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you should see what -- I don\'t know which one you\'re referring to.\xc2\xa0 You should look at what the AMA put out after the so-called story about their opposition.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think doctors are going to say that a public option would do that, since obviously that\'s a healthy part of our health care system.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President says that he wants to get $75 billion in savings from Medicare prescription drugs over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The pharmaceutical industry says that doesn\'t necessarily have to come from lower prices for medications.\xc2\xa0 Do you know of some other way to get to that target without lower prices?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speak for them.\xc2\xa0 I know what the President has outlined.\xc2\xa0 I know what Peter and Nancy-Ann talked to you guys about in preparation for the Saturday radio address.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think the President believes strongly that reform can\'t just -- if "reform" is simply perpetuating over the course of 10 more years the way we\'ve delivered medicine, the way we\'ve practiced medicine, the way we\'ve paid for medicine over the previous 10 years, then we\'re not getting reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think that\'s why the President has outlined a series of proposals, including the ones he added to this Saturday, that not only make it affordable -- make reform affordable, but also change in a positive way how we deliver health care and how we do it in a way that\'s best for the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think Medicare should negotiate more strenuously with the pharmaceutical companies for better prices?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into negotiating here, but obviously we\'re working with all entities, including the pharmaceutical industry, to bring about reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Netanyahu speech yesterday, the administration sort of welcomed the things that he had to say about a separate Palestinian state, but the Palestinians have pretty firmly rejected it.\xc2\xa0 Did the President really get what he needed from Netanyahu in order to push the peace process forward?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the government -- the Netanyahu government took a big step forward yesterday in acknowledging for the first time the need for a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that there is a long way to go and many twists and turns in the road to get there, but is pleased thus far with the progress that\'s being made.\xc2\xa0 And I think yesterday\'s speech certainly is a big part of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be able to do something to get the Palestinians on board?\xc2\xa0 What is he going to do --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'re working and discussing with all involved how we can move this process forward, how we can create a two-state solution whereby Israel and the Palestinians live side by side in peace and security.\xc2\xa0 I think what Mr. Netanyahu said yesterday is an important part of that reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  10:58 A.M.
