Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:00 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, let me inform you that tomorrow President Obama will sign the bipartisan bill to cut student loan interest rates.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is a bill that passed with wide majority support on both sides of the aisle and will save millions of students an average of $1,500 on loans they take out this year.</p>\n<p>Even with this important bill signed into law, much work remains to ensure college stays within reach for middle-class families and those striving to get into the middle class.</p>\n<p>As the President said in his speech at Knox College, in the coming months he will lay out an aggressive strategy to build on the historic college affordability steps this administration has already taken.\xc2\xa0 And I mention this just for housekeeping purposes, that the signing will have pooled press coverage.</p>\n<p>With that, Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Officials in the Philippines said today that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to start negotiations with the U.S. shortly for an increased American military presence there, and they say that that is in part to counter Chinese aggression in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. seeking a larger military presence in the Philippines?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing to report to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we are very focused on, and have been since President Obama took office, on the need to rebalance our foreign policy and to in particular focus on the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in a variety of ways that we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in the region, and that includes with some of the steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken within the security realm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about potential agreements we might have.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, and it\xe2\x80\x99s because the United States has historically had an important role to play in the Pacific, the Asia Pacific region, and that role has to continue.\xc2\xa0 Some of the fastest-growing economies in the world are there, and we need to be fully engaged throughout the region both economically and when it comes to security matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually about an agreement, this is about starting negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Can you not even say if negotiations are starting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I cannot confirm that, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then one loose end on Russia, after the announcement yesterday.\xc2\xa0 With regards to Snowden, is the U.S. position now that you are still seeking Russia\xe2\x80\x99s help in bringing Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. even though he\xe2\x80\x99s now been granted asylum?\xc2\xa0 Or are you kind of in a point now where you\xe2\x80\x99re going to let him stay there for the year and try to negotiate something for after that asylum is up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly remains our position that Mr. Snowden should be returned to the United States where he faces felony charges and where he will be afforded all the rights and protections of defendants in this country.</p>\n<p>It still remains our position that there is a longstanding level of cooperation with Russia on law enforcement matters which would have made it possible for Russia to take that step and obviously to take that step in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our position on this has been clear for a long time, and it has been stated both publicly and privately in conversations with our Russian counterparts.\xc2\xa0 So it remains our position --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s your position or not, are you still actively working with them to try to bring him back right now?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have a lot of fish to fry, if you will, with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of issues to engage with the Russians over.\xc2\xa0 And there is a two-plus-two ministerial meeting tomorrow here in Washington and there will be a host of topics.\xc2\xa0 So this is not the focus of our engagement with Russia, but it is not something that we\'re dropping by any means.\xc2\xa0 And it remains our position that there is ample legal justification to return Mr. Snowden to the United States.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a dissident.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not a whistleblower.\xc2\xa0 He is wanted on charges for the unauthorized public release of classified information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a few days now since George W. Bush had his heart procedure.\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to the former President or members of the Bush family since then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President did speak with former President Bush yesterday to wish him well, and is glad to hear that the procedure went well and that former President Bush is recovering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just back on Russia for a second.\xc2\xa0 The President is facing some criticism for the way the Snowden affair played out, the confrontation resulting in the cancelled summit.\xc2\xa0 Given Russia\xe2\x80\x99s importance as a player on issues like Syria and North Korea -- people point to, for example, the 2010 exchange of Russians that went sort of quietly without a hitch.\xc2\xa0 Given Russia\xe2\x80\x99s importance, is the President rethinking the way this happened?\xc2\xa0 Does he regret the way this ended up?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is disappointed, as he said and I said, by the decision the Russians made not to return Mr. Snowden to the United States, by the decision they made to grant him temporary asylum.\xc2\xa0 We have said from the beginning, going back to 2009, that it is in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to pursue an engagement with Russia that is very clear-eyed, that allows for basically parallel conversations about the issues where we can make progress and cooperate, and the issues where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 And that has been the case from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Now, when it comes to the decision to cancel the summit, as I think has been well reported, there were a variety of challenges that led to the assessment that this was not the right time to have a summit.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Mr. Snowden was a factor, but he was far from the only factor.\xc2\xa0 And as you know -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering these things for a long time -- summits of leaders tend to be designed around making progress on significant issues that -- progress that has been achieved in the run-up to a summit of that nature, and we had not seen that progress sufficiently on a range of issues to merit a summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different topic altogether.\xc2\xa0 So next week he goes on holiday.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of what he plans to do?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do anything on the work side with regards to budget or fiscal issues or international issues, or is it purely a vacation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to make a Fed chairman decision and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Joke.\xc2\xa0 The President very much looks forward to being able to spend a few days with his family, and it also remains the case that wherever he is, he\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States and will be dedicating a portion of his day to being briefed and working on all the issues that are on the table in front of him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to tell you about, but he will be, of course, regularly updated on the current threat that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be regularly updated on issues going on around the world and the country, but with any luck, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also have some time to relax with his family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to the summit with President Putin, why not go to Russia, why not go to Moscow and have the President sit down with President Putin face to face and tell him, air these differences face to face, rather than cancel this summit?\xc2\xa0 President Reagan sat down with the Soviets when the stakes were much higher.\xc2\xa0 Why not do that here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to resist the temptation to give you a little history about some of those issues that I happen to be familiar with when it comes to previous summits in the Soviet era.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there was a different relationship and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- there were many different issues on the table.</p>\n<p>What is absolutely the case is that President Obama met with President Putin at the G8.\xc2\xa0 President Obama has spoken with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 And counterparts at different levels of government in this administration have spoken with -- or rather their counterparts in the Russian government about this issue and many others.\xc2\xa0 And as I was just saying in answer to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, we did not see, on a range of fronts, the kind of sufficient progress on some of the major issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaging with the Russians on to merit a summit.</p>\n<p>Mr. Snowden was a factor, but not the only factor.\xc2\xa0 And when you have summits like these, you want the kind of progress prior to them to be sufficient enough to merit a meeting of the leaders.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage with the Russians, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced by the high-level meeting that\xe2\x80\x99s being held tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And we have a host of business with the Russians, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 But it just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the right time for a summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the issue of the embassy closings, there have been some critics out there who have now described this as an overreaction, and there was a New York Times article that seemed to indicate that there were people within al Qaeda that were sort of celebrating the fact that the United States closed all these embassies around the world.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cdamned if you do, damned if you don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d factor there.\xc2\xa0 Are you feeling that inside the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the decisions made were made out of an abundance of caution in reaction to a very real stream of information about a potential threat.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to protecting Americans serving in our embassies and facilities around the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to take the necessary precautions when there is this kind of credible threat information.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the right decision to make, and we continue to assess the information that we have and continue to view the threat as we have all week, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve made these decisions, and absolutely believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do in the interest of the safety and security of Americans serving abroad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some other reporting out there, Jay, that I just wanted to ask you about on the issue of domestic surveillance.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s an article in The New York Times, not to keep asking you about articles in The New York Times -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Michael doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind -- that indicates that perhaps some of this surveillance of emails coming from the United States might be wider than originally, I guess, acknowledged by U.S. officials.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, can you describe how widespread this surveillance is of emails being sent from people inside the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the article eventually explained we have made clear that under FAA 702, the NSA may not intentionally target a U.S. person.\xc2\xa0 In carrying out its mission, NSA collects only what it is explicitly authorized to collect.\xc2\xa0 And while NSA analysts examine only a very small percentage of the world\xe2\x80\x99s traffic, if communications of U.S. persons are incidentally collected the agency must follow minimization procedures that are approved by the U.S. Attorney General and designed to protect the privacy of U.S. persons.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, these procedures require NSA to minimize the acquisition processing, retention and dissemination of information of or concerning U.S. persons.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the program is to investigate and potentially prevent terrorist threats emanating from foreign sources.\xc2\xa0 And the protections in place regarding the inadvertent collection of information of U.S. citizens ensure that there\'s a minimized -- a process of minimization that protects the privacy of American citizens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just to boil this down into plain language that people can understand -- forgive me for following up -- if Joe Schmo from Kokomo wants to know if when he sends an email overseas is it being read, what would you say?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not being read.\xc2\xa0 The information that is targeted has to do with terrorist threats or potential terrorist threats emanating from foreign persons in foreign areas.\xc2\xa0 And there are procedures in place -- as I just described and I\'m sure ODNI and others, NSA, can explain to you in greater detail -- that ensure that inadvertently collected information is minimized and dealt with appropriately.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to ask you about the so-called homosexual "propaganda" law in Russia.\xc2\xa0 Of course, the President was asked by Jay Leno about this, and he said, "I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them."\xc2\xa0 So my question is, does the President condemn this Russian law?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President absolutely opposes and has made clear in other countries laws that discriminate against individuals, whether for race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, with due respect, I\'m asking specifically this law.\xc2\xa0 Does the President condemn this law?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Sure, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned that American delegations going over to the Olympics could face prosecution under this law for so-called promoting homosexuality?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think the President made clear the other night is that it is in Russia\'s interest to ensure that the Olympics are a success.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s certainly true of other host countries when they have the privilege of hosting an Olympics.\xc2\xa0 And he would expect them to take the necessary measures to ensure their success.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And has this issue been raised directly with the Russians, both in terms of condemning this law and for ensuring that American citizens traveling to the Olympics, including the athletes, won\'t be detained?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You would have to direct that question to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know if the administration has brought this issue up with the Russians?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask you to address that question to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t personally know whether those conversations have been held.\xc2\xa0 It\'s our clear position that we oppose laws like that in any country, and that includes Russia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what do you say to those who say that there should be a boycott of the Olympics over this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the President\'s remarks, which clearly stated his views and our position, and our expectation that it\'s in Russia\'s interest to ensure that the Olympics are a success.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a basic human rights issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jon, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question.\xc2\xa0 The President answered it on television.\xc2\xa0 The Olympics are not for a while.\xc2\xa0 I think that our view is clear.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly expect the host of any Olympics to ensure that they are a success, and that includes ensuring that delegations and athletes are all treated appropriately and with respect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a movement to -- for those who say it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be boycotted, but the position should be made clear that American athletes, athletes everywhere should wear symbols expressing displeasure and condemnation of this law, and that that\'s something the American delegation should do.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House say about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what our views are, what the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are, which he himself expressed, and what our expectations are.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, evaluating the state of the reset with Russia, is it impossible to have a reset with Putin leading Russia?\xc2\xa0 Is he the irritant here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made it more difficult since Medvedev stepped down to achieve the kind of progress that the administration is seeking?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we engage with nations and make progress or run into obstacles based on policy, not individuals.\xc2\xa0 I would note that, as Russia hands would be sure to point out, that Vladimir Putin was Prime Minister and widely viewed, I think accurately, as having a significant influence over the course of affairs while President Medvedev was President.\xc2\xa0 And we were able to make the kind of progress that we made in our relations with Russia at that time.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to note that despite the challenges that we have encountered in our relationship with Russia in recent times, that we still do have cooperation with the Russians on a number of important issues.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to engage with the Russians, as we are tomorrow, to try to make progress on those and other areas.</p>\n<p>But there is no question that we have run into some obstacles on some important issues, and for that reason, as well as the issues of Mr. Snowden, we decided it was not the right to have a bilateral summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In conversations with some who are experts on Russia and some in this building, there is a sense that the reset was really a Medvedev sort of phenomenon.\xc2\xa0 And though Putin was clearly influencing some of the decisions, much more was achieved at that period of time, and the reset is sort of for that period of time almost only, kind of encased in sort of a policy amber, if you will.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s pretty good for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not bad for a Thursday --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I like that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I like that.\xc2\xa0 I like that, yes.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that some of the progress we made in our relationship with Russia on issues that were in the interest of our national security and in our broader interest came when President Medvedev was in office.\xc2\xa0 However, it is important to note, even as we face the challenges we face and have the disagreements we have with the Russians, that we continue to have cooperation and agreement on a number of important issues, including those issues that we reached agreement with Russia on during President Medvedev\xe2\x80\x99s time as President.</p>\n<p>I\'m not minimizing the challenges we face or the disagreements we have with Russia, but I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to imagine that everything was harmonious in our relationship with Russia a few years ago and is now lacking harmony of any kind at this time.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we have a number of disagreements with Russia.\xc2\xa0 We certainly had some under President Medvedev, including over missile defense --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It worse now.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no question.\xc2\xa0 No question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Egypt -- Bill Burns has left.\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain and Senator Graham have left.\xc2\xa0 The Egyptian government has announced that it is essentially -- this transitional government -- through negotiating about the protests, and it appears that there are some signals that a confrontation is coming.\xc2\xa0 The administration and the State Department put out a very lengthy statement yesterday with the EU almost pleading with this transitional government.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there was almost a plaintiff quality to the letter:\xc2\xa0 Don\'t go down this road.\xc2\xa0 How nervous is this administration about what\xe2\x80\x99s coming next in Egypt?\xc2\xa0 And is there a sense of powerlessness now that Burns and these senators that were at least working in some tandem with the administration are out of the country?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry was there, as you noted, and had a number of important meetings and expressed our strongly held view -- expressed also in the joint statement with EU High Representative Ashton -- that more violence would be a troubling sign and we remain concerned and troubled that the government and opposition leaders have yet to find a way to break what is a dangerous stalemate and to agree to implement tangible confidence-building measures.</p>\n<p>It is essential, in our view -- and that\'s why we have been working intensively over the past week on this issue\xc2\xa0 -- to urge the Egyptian government and opposition parties to begin a process of genuine reconciliation to move ahead inclusively to consider amendments to the Constitution, and to prepare as quickly as possible for parliamentary and presidential elections.</p>\n<p>In addition to working with the EU, we have cooperated closely in this effort to urge the Egyptians to take this course of action with the UAE and with Qatar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that we have made broadly clear to the Egyptian authorities as well as the opposition that reconciliation is the path they need to follow for the sake of the Egyptian people and for the sake of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s transition away from authoritarianism and to democracy.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with the transitional government, with the opposition parties to urge that course of action on them, because it\xe2\x80\x99s very much in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xc2\xa0 And it is the stated objective of the transitional authorities to move to elections, to move to a return to a democratically elected civilian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And our focus has been on urging those authorities and urging the opposition to participate in a process of reconciliation to allow for full representation of all views in that process.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue that effort both from here and when we have high officials visiting Egypt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get more concerted without having the President go there, to have Burns there for several days, these two senators, and then as soon as they leave get this announcement that reconciliation talks, if not over, are not going to be engaged in to the level that you were pleading with the Egyptian transitional government.\xc2\xa0 How disappointed or frustrated are you about this turn of events?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there has not been a return to violence but we are very concerned about that possibility, and we made that clear and we continue to make that clear.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to urge all parties to pursue reconciliation over stalemate and confrontation, especially violent confrontation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We urge the authorities to allow for peaceful demonstrations, and we urge the authorities to allow for an inclusive process where all voices and factions are heard and represented within Egypt for the sake of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow on NSA and Joe Schmo\xe2\x80\x99s concerns that were mentioned by Jim.\xc2\xa0 The President on Leno -- is the issue more that the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can track a phone number or an email address that we know is connected to some sort of terrorism threat\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Those are his words.\xc2\xa0 And then the Times is reporting today that, in their words, the NSA is \xe2\x80\x9csearching the contents of vast amounts of Americans\xe2\x80\x99 email and text communications,\xe2\x80\x9d and presumably not all of those people are connected to terror, as the President said.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.\xc2\xa0 What I made clear in answer to Jim is that this program is focused entirely on foreign terrorist threats, and information that is tracked is related solely to that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the intelligence community for more details.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear of that in what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the program, 702, Section 702.\xc2\xa0 Representatives of Congress who have been fully briefed on this program have made that clear in their public presentations and will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I think is absolutely the case -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re blending a couple of things here -- is the metadata collection represented by 215 is not content, it is telephone numbers and call times.\xc2\xa0 It is -- any further action requires procedures in place, again, that have judicial and congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And separately, the programs that are looking at or seeking to find more information about foreign terrorist threats fall under 702 and are as I described and as members of Congress and the intelligence community have described.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick topics.\xc2\xa0 The Fort Hood trial -- a victim of that attack who was shot in the chest has an op-ed in The Washington Post today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying he and others are being denied government benefits because the administration classified this as a noncombat, workplace violence incident, instead of a terrorist attack.\xc2\xa0 Why did the administration not call it a terror attack?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a question for the Department of Defense, but I will take the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one on -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 One, Peter King, a Republican, a couple of days ago -- you know he\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican -- was saying the administration should not be criticized for not doing enough to protect consulates and embassies in the run-up to Benghazi and now be criticized for having an abundance of caution.\xc2\xa0 He said you deserve credit for that.</p>\n<p>There was an analyst quoted today in The New York Times, though, that was saying he believes that you\xe2\x80\x99re in a defensive crouch since Benghazi, and that the administration is too eager to close these embassies.\xc2\xa0 This was --- how do you answer that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say what I said earlier, which is that we have information that is specific enough and credible enough to lead us to take the action we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in order to, out of an abundance of caution, ensure the security of our personnel in a variety of countries serving abroad.\xc2\xa0 And we are convinced that that is the right step to take, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate procedures and steps moving forward as we get more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Last week, CNN reported that dozens of people who were working for the CIA around Benghazi on the night of the attack, and they\'re claiming that some of these CIA operatives now feel like they\'re being intimidated, that they\'re getting polygraph tests, sometimes on a monthly basis, which is much more frequent than CIA officials apparently normally get, because the government is trying to figure out whether or not they\'re talking to the media, they\'re talking to Congress about what happened that night.</p>\n<p>Can you assure the American people that\'s not happening?\xc2\xa0 And can you shed any light on what the CIA was doing?\xc2\xa0 I realize there may be classified information there.\xc2\xa0 But, in general, is there anything you can say about what the CIA was doing there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on CIA individuals or operations around the world.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the CIA on that.\xc2\xa0 I would also refer you to the very clear statement in response to that, put out by the CIA, which says:</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe CIA has worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, CIA leadership has informed officers who may want to speak with the oversight committees on this matter that it will support and facilitate such contact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want to, and there is an established process to facilitate such communication on a confidential basis.\xc2\xa0 The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi the opportunity to meet with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We are not aware of any CIA employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern with Congress about that Benghazi incident.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I think that\'s a fairly detailed response to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have you done anything -- you\xe2\x80\x99re just relaying on what they\'re saying.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House checked with the CIA to make sure that that\'s the case?\xc2\xa0 Or that\'s just their statement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would refer you to the statement the CIA made on the record as a response to that report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as of yesterday, the President hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to President Putin about his decision.\xc2\xa0 Has that changed?\xc2\xa0 Has he reached out to Putin?\xc2\xa0 Or does he have any plans to do so?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any calls to read out or preview.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just following up on what Major was asking, given this latest deterioration, does the President view the reset as officially over?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I tried to answer this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try again.\xc2\xa0 When the President came into office, he saw a situation where our relations with Russia were at a point where we were not achieving cooperation on issues where we thought it was possible to achieve cooperation, and thus pursued a policy that sought, in a very clear-eyed way, engagement with Russia on a whole host of issues, recognizing that we would disagree on some of those issues, like missile defense.\xc2\xa0 That process led to successes in cooperation that have directly benefitted the United States, directly benefitted U.S. national security, and were well worth the effort.\xc2\xa0 Some of that cooperation continues to this day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have also made clear that we have had longstanding disagreements with Russia on a number of issues and we have seen increased obstacles in some of the efforts we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged with the Russians on when it comes to trying to make further progress on some of these issues, separate and apart from the Snowden disagreement.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason we decided to cancel the summit.</p>\n<p>But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, it is still an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 We will still engage with the Russians on the issues that matter between us, including the disagreements as well as the areas of potential cooperation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Secretaries of Defense and State are meeting with their counterparts tomorrow, and we will continue that process moving forward, always being very blunt and clear about our disagreements on Syria, on missile defense, and other areas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess given the fact that the reset was such a large priority for President Obama, what role does he plan?\xc2\xa0 You point out obviously the meetings tomorrow, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, but what role does he play in getting this back --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States and he oversees our foreign policy and engages with countries around the world, and his team engages with countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 And his Secretaries of State and Defense will be engaging with and meeting with their Russian counterparts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you one about immigration.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Chuck Schumer said he was okay with a piecemeal approach to immigration.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe would much prefer a big comprehensive bill, but any way that the House can get there is okay by us.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to the House process, not to an outcome.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the outcome has to be comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That is the path forward that the President has made clear is necessary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the path that a bipartisan, large majority in the Senate has made clear is necessary.\xc2\xa0 I mean, how we get from here to there in the House is an open question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see that as the most realistic path to getting to this point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The legislative analysis, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to congressional reporters and others.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is, it is our hope and expectation that a comprehensive immigration reform bill will emerge from Congress that the President can sign, that meets his principles of significantly enhanced border security measures, of provisions in place to streamline and improve our legal immigration system, provisions in place that make sure that all of our businesses are playing by the same set of rules, and provisions in place that ensure that there is a pathway to citizenship that means going to the back of the line, paying fines and paying taxes, but has a clear pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is what the Senate bill represents.\xc2\xa0 That is what is right for the country.\xc2\xa0 That is what is enormously right for our economy, for our businesses, for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And I think as we see around the country, there is broad support for this -- Democrats, Republicans, labor, big business and small business, faith communities, law enforcement communities.\xc2\xa0 And we know it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, and we believe that it is something that will happen because there\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming support to do it.</p>\n<p>Yes, and then Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what exactly are the expectations for this meeting tomorrow, the Kerry/Hagel meeting with counterparts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying, we have a number of issues that we engage with the Russians on -- security issues, economic issues -- and we will continue to discuss those issues with the Russian government going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect some progress, or is this just a reality check?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, this is an important meeting among high-level officials of both governments.\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to the State Department and the Defense Department to read out those meetings and to preview them.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to make is that on a whole range of security issues, a whole range of issues that are regional or global, we do and should engage with the Russians and will continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At times, when counterparts of high-ranking Cabinet members have been in town, the President has also seen them briefly.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that might happen tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates or hints to provide.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up just a bit on that?\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President had passed a message on to the secretaries to these counterparts on a personal level to President Putin.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President speaks with his Secretaries of Defense and State all the time.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this issue and this relationship, as they have so many of the other issues that are subject to the conversations he has with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to read out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I just add another quick question?\xc2\xa0 In 1980, President Jimmy Carter boycotted the Olympics, brought 64 other nations along with him, including China and Japan, West Germany and Canada.\xc2\xa0 What would be the tipping point for the President to go down this road?\xc2\xa0 Is there any one thing that would --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation we\xe2\x80\x99re not having.\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear about his views on the issues of gay rights, LGBT rights, and concerns that have been raised internationally about laws in Russia, and his expectation that, as host of the Olympics, Russia will conduct them in a way that shines a favorable light on them as well as ensures the absolutely necessary and proper treatment of delegations and athletes.</p>\n<p>To speculate about something like that is I don\xe2\x80\x99t think in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The President is going on holiday, as was mentioned last week.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about how the costs of such a holiday are broken up between the President personally and the rest of the taxpayers?\xc2\xa0 I know, for example, he --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In keeping with longstanding tradition, using the same formulas that have been in place, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, for administration after administration after administration.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more specific for you on it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that has been the case for years, whether it was President Bush, President Clinton, President Bush, President Reagan.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, when you\'re President of the United States, you carry a little baggage when you travel.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s true whether it\'s on a summit, international meeting, a domestic trip, or for a vacation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing just quickly.\xc2\xa0 He has no plans to meet with Putin in St. Petersburg, is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Russia is hosting the G20 and is one of the participants in the G20, so I\'m sure they will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no bilat?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No plans for a bilat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re told that at the White House tonight Secretary Kerry is meeting with Jewish groups.\xc2\xa0 Why is that meeting happening at the White House instead of State?\xc2\xa0 And does the President plan to stop by?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any changes to announce to the President\'s schedule.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s a great place to have a meeting.\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, I don\'t have any more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s not a specific White House interest or plan for White House engagement in that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think that the Secretary of State and other members of the administration engage with groups all the time.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes those meetings are held here, sometimes they\'re held at different agencies.</p>\n<p>April.\xc2\xa0 And then Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\'m going to go back to issues of security, especially with these increased threats.\xc2\xa0 Embassies around the world are being looked at.\xc2\xa0 What\'s happening here back home?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern back home, particularly for rail, as we\'ve seen issues in the Tube in London and in Spain?\xc2\xa0 What\'s happening back here?\xc2\xa0 What are the concerns for back here?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And as we\'ve said, the information we have suggests that the potential threat emanates from and may occur in the Arabian Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 However, we can\'t rule anything out.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason we take necessary precautions when it comes to our domestic homeland security.\xc2\xa0 And DHS would have more details, but as I\'ve said in the past, there are measures taken when appropriate -- both seen and unseen -- by TSA and other agencies to ensure or enhance the security procedures in place when it is viewed that there is need to do so.\xc2\xa0 And I think they might have more information for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So while the threat that we\'ve been discussing emanates from and may occur in the Arabian Peninsula or the broader region of North Africa or the Middle East, we certainly can\'t rule anything out.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we put out the -- the State Department put out the global warning and why we\'ve taken a number of security precautions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, to follow up, in prior administrations since 9/11, many would say it\'s not a matter of if, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of when.\xc2\xa0 Is that kind of the same mentality here that something is imminent at some point in time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it is absolutely the case that there is a constant stream of potential threats out there to the United States because there are people around the world who want to do harm to the U.S. and harm to American citizens.\xc2\xa0 Assessments are made by our national security team based on the information available to them about the level of potential threats and the precautions that need to be taken in response to those.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have to maintain our vigilance as a nation because, as I said, those threats exist.\xc2\xa0 And while, as we\'ve talked about earlier this week, al Qaeda core and its leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been decimated and is not nearly what it was 10 years ago, al Qaeda in general and its affiliate organizations -- as we\'ve been talking about for years now -- continue to represent threats.\xc2\xa0 And AQAP in particular is viewed by the national security team as the most operational of the al Qaeda affiliates and the one that poses the greatest potential threat to the United States.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is that time of the year again, presidential vacations.\xc2\xa0 And that means the other party is saying the incumbent party is taking too much time off.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans are saying President Obama spends too much, is too extravagant on his vacations, that he is spending too much time while other problems are going on.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that kind of criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just check what they said six years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on what April is asking?\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that we are at a heightened level of alert domestically?\xc2\xa0 Can you just say that\'s the case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the specific gradations, I would refer you to the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 What I am saying, as we\'ve said all week, is that the threat, while emanating from and potentially occurring in the Arabian Peninsula, is of the nature that we can\'t rule anything out, and therefore, we\'ve taken precautions beyond the Arabian Peninsula, both with our diplomatic facilities and through other measures.</p>\n<p>So I would refer you to DHS and TSA about different procedures that may be in place when it comes to the TSA or other agencies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you doing that because you want them to be the appropriate sources of the information and you feel reluctant to do that, or would --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have specifics on the measures they\'ve taken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that and broadening it out, there are so many Americans who are confused about whether this broad global threat is something that the administration could know when to turn off in effect, know when to stand down from a threat that would seem to be ongoing and long-lasting.\xc2\xa0 So can you just explain again -- if the intelligence was somewhat non-specific but actionable, what would -- then the administration would put Americans back in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it will be an assessment of the information we have based on the variety of means that we have available to us to assess these kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 What the current threat represents is very real and, therefore, we took the very deliberate action that we took as an administration to ensure that out of an abundance of caution, some facilities were temporarily closed and some individuals are removed from Yemen, for example.</p>\n<p>This was not the ongoing generalized reality that we have groups and individuals out there in the world who want to do harm to the United States.\xc2\xa0 This was more specific than that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so this will continue until there is that level of intelligence so that you can ensure or to make --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there will be an assessment.\xc2\xa0 And when there is an assessment that this current threat is not what it was, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably change our posture.\xc2\xa0 But I certainly don\'t have a timeline to predict to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on immigration.\xc2\xa0 There are advocates of immigration reform who believe fervently that the President has the executive power, as he did with DREAMers, to take legalization to the next level using his own executive authority.\xc2\xa0 Separate and apart from the President\xe2\x80\x99s ambition to have legislation, does he believe he has that executive authority to take it one step above the DREAMers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear when the action was taken by DHS with regards to prosecutorial discretion that this was not a solution and it was far short of what was needed when it came to legislation.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely the case that we have to enforce the law, and we do.</p>\n<p>We can make decisions, as were made by DHS when it came to making sure our resources were targeted appropriately, but those are limited actions and they do not solve the problem.\xc2\xa0 And we need to address this in a comprehensive way.\xc2\xa0 And doing it that way ensures that everyone who has a particular interest in border security on the one hand, or making sure our businesses all play by the same rules on the other, or that there is a credible, if difficult, path to citizenship, but a clear path to citizenship on the other hand -- that all of these -- and then, of course, those who, rightly, see the necessity of reforming our legal immigration system so that we can ensure, for example, that some of the best and brightest from around the world who study here and want to start businesses here can do that -- that all of these elements come together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s what helps build the impact on our economy -- the positive impact -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s also what helps build the consensus around this enterprise.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President supports it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill and then Ann, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- did you have anything?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Bill; Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann or me.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly call on you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to come back to the summit for just a second.\xc2\xa0 Everything seemed to be on track toward a summit until the Snowden release -- report.\xc2\xa0 So are you telling us today that even without Edward Snowden, there would still be no summit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that Mr. Snowden was a factor, but that there were and have been for some time now a number of issues that had caused us to assess the utility of holding a summit at this time.\xc2\xa0 Obviously to guess at what the outcome of that assessment would have been absent the Mr. Snowden factor is hard to do.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not denying that Mr. Snowden was a factor\xc2\xa0 -- we\'ve made that clear in everything we\'ve said about it.</p>\n<p>But we\'ve also made clear, because we think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, that we have not achieved the kind of progress on some of the issues where we have been trying to engage the Russians to enough of a degree that having a summit made sense.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Is the reason the President is going to Sweden because as just as the United States is trying to deport Edward Snowden, a leaker, back to the United States, Sweden is also trying to extradite a leaks figure, Julian Assange, after --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sweden is a close friend and partner to the United States and plays a key leadership role on the international stage, including in opening new trade and investment opportunities through the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, advancing clean technologies and promoting environmental sustainability.</p>\n<p>And the fact is, as I think I said on the plane or one of my briefings this week, this has been under -- well, it must have been yesterday since we only announced it yesterday -- we have been considering a trip for some time. When we were able to -- or decided to cancel the summit in Moscow, it made sense to couple the visit to Sweden with the G20 summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President met at the G20 last year with President Putin, the administration briefers came out and said that they were pleased with the trajectory of relations between the countries.\xc2\xa0 Is it President Putin who has changed the equation here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I addressed that in part.\xc2\xa0 I would say that a year ago is not now, and that over the course of time we have encountered obstacles on a number of issues and have been unable to reach the kind of progress with the Russians on some of these issues that we had hoped.</p>\n<p>We\'ll continue to engage with them on all of these issues, including those that we have agreement currently and are seeking more engagement and those where we have disagreement.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, as I\'ve noted, we assessed that we were not reaching the kinds of -- making the kind of progress that we wanted in anticipation of a summit to make the summit useful, and therefore, we decided to cancel.</p>\n<p>Thanks, all.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:49 P.M.
