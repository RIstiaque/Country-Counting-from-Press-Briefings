EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see you a little earlier than usual.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to try to use your time very efficiently this morning.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to be focused on obviously the President\xe2\x80\x99s overseas trip.\xc2\xa0 We obviously did a briefing yesterday to focus on the India portion of the trip.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to do a briefing early next week to talk about the G20 and some of the other economic issues that are at play on the trip.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of them and I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interest among you guys in covering those aspects of the trip.\xc2\xa0 But I ask you to hold those questions until that briefing on Monday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gibbs is going to be out in a couple hours to do the regular daily briefing, so if there are questions about the midterm elections that you haven\'t asked in the last six weeks you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to ask him about those then.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to lay out the ground rules, this is an off-camera briefing but it\xe2\x80\x99s on the record, not embargoed in any way.\xc2\xa0 So you guys can report on this right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll start with -- here today is Ben Rhodes and Jeff Bader from the NSC who will sort of walk through the schedule for the other portion of the trip that comes after India and talk about some of the issues that the President will be confronting while he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Ben, do you want to start?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just pick up the schedule from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President will conclude his visit to India on Tuesday, November 9th, and I\'ll just underscore a couple things off the bat.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as I said yesterday, the countries we\'re going to be talking about today are Indonesia, South Korea and Japan.\xc2\xa0 And this whole trip we do want to underscore is a part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Asia strategy -- and Jeff can speak to that -- a renewed engagement of the United States in Asia that is founded upon our core alliances in the region, and of course, South Korea and Japan are at the top of that list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly it\xe2\x80\x99s on deepening partnerships with emerging powers, and Indonesia is certainly on that list.\xc2\xa0 And it also includes increased engagement in America with the Asian architecture -- so that\'s Asian regional institutions such as ASEAN, which the President has met with a couple of times, and APEC, which he\'ll be going to on this trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we see this very much in the context of the focus we put on Asia as a region of the world with the most dynamic and growing markets that are going to be fundamental to our export initiative of doubling exports in the world, but also fundamental to a number of political and security concerns that will a subject of the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing I\'d just underscore about all four of these countries, as I did yesterday, is that these are, all four, democracies, and again, we believe that each of these countries sends a strong signal of the ability of democracy to thrive within Asia and the ability of robust economic development to take place within emerging democracies as well as established ones.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the 9th, the President will travel to Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 As many of you know, we wanted to get to Indonesia for some time this year.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, circumstances intervened a couple of times, so the President was very happy to have this chance to go to Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a country that he lived in when he was growing up and his sister, of course, Maya, has deep roots in Indonesia as well.\xc2\xa0 And so the President is very much looking forward to this opportunity to fulfill his commitment to go to Indonesia this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Indonesia is an emerging economy, a member of the G20, and the President will be attending the G20 meetings on this trip.\xc2\xa0 We have a growing economic relationship with Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also an emerging democracy, quite an inspiring story of the emergence of democracy in Indonesia in the last decade.\xc2\xa0 They are the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim-majority country.\xc2\xa0 So we see in Indonesia the intersection of a lot of key American interests and we see this as a partnership that is very important to the future of American interests in Asia and the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will begin on the 9th with a bilateral meeting with President Yudhoyono in Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 He, after that meeting, will have a press conference with the two Presidents.\xc2\xa0 And then later that night, the Indonesians have graciously agreed to host an official dinner for the President in Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 So that will be the official portion of the program on the 9th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the morning of the 10th -- the 10th is Heroes Day in Indonesia, a major national holiday, so the President will begin the day by laying a wreath at the Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 From there he will go on and pay a visit to the Istiqlal Mosque, which is the largest mosque in Indonesia -- again, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim-majority country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then from there the President will deliver a speech -- not from the mosque, but then he\xe2\x80\x99ll go to another site, which we will -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in the process of finalizing.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver a speech to the Indonesian people, and in that speech he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance talk about the partnership that we\xe2\x80\x99re building with Indonesia, but also to talk about some of the themes of democracy and development and our outreach to Muslim communities around the world, while also speaking of Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s pluralism and tolerance as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- while Muslim-majority, it\xe2\x80\x99s host to a broad religious diversity.\xc2\xa0 So this speech will give the President an opportunity to discuss some of the themes that many of you have heard him talk about and to, again, in a country where he can speak to the importance of Indonesia to him, personally, having lived there for several years in Jakarta as a boy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave Jakarta and proceed on to Seoul, and spend the night in Seoul on the 10th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the 11th, Veterans Day, the President will begin his day by commemorating Veterans Day by speaking to U.S. troops at Yongsan Garrison in Seoul.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add a couple points on this. First of all, it is not only Veterans Day but it\xe2\x80\x99s also the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War this year.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to pay tribute to all of the U.S. servicemen and women who have served in the Korean War and then also on the Korean Peninsula in the decades that have followed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, in doing so, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also have the opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary progress that the Republic of Korea has made in the 60 years since the beginning of the Korean War.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the quite astonishing stories of the second half of the 20th century, the economic development of Korea and the development of its democracy, which of course is tied very closely to the strength of our alliance with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From there, the President will go into a bilateral meeting with President Lee at the Blue House.\xc2\xa0 Jeff can speak a bit to the topics of that bilat.\xc2\xa0 Then President Lee will host a working lunch with President Obama at the Blue House, as he did during President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s last visit to Korea last year.\xc2\xa0 Then following that bilat and lunch, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a press conference with President Lee as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then following the bilat and press conference with President Lee, the President will have a bilateral meeting with President Hu Jintao of China.\xc2\xa0 And Jeff, again, can speak to some of the subjects of that bilat.\xc2\xa0 This is again, I think, Jeff that -- I don\'t know that any Presidents had that many -- seventh bilat with Hu.\xc2\xa0 So this continues very robust high-level consultations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think any President in a similar period of time has had this meetings with a Chinese counterpart.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seventh?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Seventh, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then from there, the President will begin the program of the G20.\xc2\xa0 Again -- I\'ll just echo Josh -- we plan to have a separate briefing with the economic team to go through the themes of the G20 and to discuss issues related to the ongoing negotiations around the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll work through the schedule here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The G20 working dinner will be that night in Seoul at the National Museum.\xc2\xa0 Then the next day, Friday, November 12th, is the official program of the G20, which will include of course a morning plenary session, a family photo, a working lunch, an afternoon plenary session, similar to the previous G20s that you all have covered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the close of the G20, the President will hold a press conference, as he normally does.\xc2\xa0 So I just do want to, for your own planning purposes, remind you that that\'s four press conferences that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be holding on this trip, one with Prime Minister Singh, one with President Yudhoyono, one with President Lee, and then the concluding G20 conference.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that press conference, the President will leave South Korea and travel on to Yokohama, Japan, again, Korea and Japan being the foundation of our engagement in the region as our two very close allies in East Asia, and this being the 50th anniversary of the U.S.-Japan Alliance, which Jeff can speak to a little bit.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very much looking forward to the second visit the President will make to Japan, following the one he did last November.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saturday, November 13th, the President will begin the day by giving remarks to the CEO business summit that is attached to the APEC meetings.\xc2\xa0 And at this opportunity, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking about the economic advances that have been made throughout the trip -- that obviously begins with a fairly robust economic component of our India visit, as Mike Froman discussed yesterday, around our efforts to expand our exports into India and deepen our engagement with India\xe2\x80\x99s economy, will proceed through the meetings and at the G20.\xc2\xa0 And so, this speech is an opportunity for the President to put in context our aggressive efforts to increase our economic engagement and our exports in Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following that speech, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Kan of Japan.\xc2\xa0 He enjoyed meeting with Prime Minister Kan on the margins of the G20 in Toronto and waited to, before the APEC meetings, have this opportunity to meet with him in Yokohama.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following that, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Gillard of Australia.\xc2\xa0 And, again, Jeff can speak to some of the subject matter of this bilat as well.\xc2\xa0 Australia is obviously one of our closest allies in the region -- and the world, as well.\xc2\xa0 This will be his first bilateral meeting with the new Prime Minister since her election.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After these bilats, we\xe2\x80\x99ll head into the APEC program, which begins with a working lunch and then a leaders retreat.\xc2\xa0 And then, that night there\xe2\x80\x99s an official APEC dinner as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The following day, we are planning to begin the day with a bilateral meeting with President Medvedev of Russia.\xc2\xa0 And this, of course, is one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s closest and most active relationships with any foreign leader.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss a number of issues, including the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made recently in terms of U.S. support for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the WTO, as well as our ongoing cooperation on issues like non-proliferation, nuclear security, and other security issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that, the APEC program will conclude with a leaders retreat and working lunch.\xc2\xa0 And then, following that working lunch, the President will pay a visit to the great Buddha statue that is nearby in Yokohama.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the marvels of Japanese culture, and the President had visited this particular Buddha statue as a child actually when he visited Japan, so he is very much looking forward to this opportunity to pay a return visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then after that, we will head home to the United States, arriving on the afternoon of the 14th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, Jeff, you want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Just two overall comments on the themes of the Asia trip, just to supplement what Ben said.\xc2\xa0 Ben mentioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest and stress on multilateral institutions in the region.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that the President has decided that we\xe2\x80\x99re joining the East Asia Summit, which is a grouping of 16 key countries in Asia that has annual meetings.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton will be attending the meeting two days from now in Hanoi on October 30th as a guest of the chair.\xc2\xa0 But in the future, this will be on the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President will participate.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important step that Asian countries welcome as a sign of our continuing involvement in Asia and evolving institutions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second thing I\xe2\x80\x99d mention about the degree of attention that Asia has got in this administration regularly at multilateral meetings; meetings with Asians, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, have been prominent, if not dominant, in terms of the number of meetings -- recalling Toronto, something like six out of the seven bilaterals that the President had were with Asian countries.\xc2\xa0 So this is continuation of a long-term interest that the President has established.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the individual countries, as Ben mentioned, the first off is Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia -- we have tried to highlight Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s growing importance in this administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President\xe2\x80\x99s biography, which of course makes him an enormously popular figure in Indonesia, but also the importance of the country, which is now a member of the G20.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the largest Muslim-majority country in the world; it\xe2\x80\x99s the largest, in terms of population, democracy in the world; and it\xe2\x80\x99s the most important country in ASEAN, which is a grouping of over half a billion people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the trip the President will launch at the presidential level what we\xe2\x80\x99re calling the comprehensive partnership between the U.S. and Indonesia, which is a way to try to deepen and broaden the relationship on political security issues, economic issues, and people-to-people issues.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing plans for increased assistance to education in Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a five-year program, a substantial five-year program, cooperation with the Indonesians on climate change, where Indonesia has been a leader in the developing world, taking -- President Yudhoyono taking a very aggressive position on curtailment of emissions.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll also consult closely with the Indonesians on issues such as Iran, where they have influence; on South China Sea; counterterrorism; and Burma. The elections will have just occurred in Burma a few days earlier -- elections which we -- will not be free and fair, in our view, but we will certainly want to talk to President Yudhoyono about next steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Korea, the next stop -- the purpose of the visit, of course, is to attend the G20.\xc2\xa0 The G20, it\xe2\x80\x99s a noteworthy development in terms of Korean history.\xc2\xa0 This is kind of a coming out for South Korea on the global stage.\xc2\xa0 President Lee has spoken about a global Korea -- that was his phrase -- and the G20, I think, is an important watershed in the developments of this global Korea. And in 2012, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the Nuclear Security Summit -- that would be another step in this process, which we have encouraged.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve dramatically altered our relationship for the better with South Korea since January 2009.\xc2\xa0 We have a very close alignment with South Korea on all issues.\xc2\xa0 I will highlight particularly on issues relating to North Korea and the six-party talks.\xc2\xa0 We have consulted with them intensively since day one, and there\'s no daylight between us.\xc2\xa0 The President has discussed this in detail with President Lee every time they\xe2\x80\x99ve met and in\xc2\xa0 their phone conversations; I\'m sure that will be a significant topic in their meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken -- we took steps to demonstrate our solidarity with the South Koreans in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan.\xc2\xa0 There have been joint exercises on both sides of the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a close bond between the two Presidents.\xc2\xa0 I think the two Presidents clearly respect and like each other.\xc2\xa0 The South Koreans, under President Obama and President Lee, sent a PRT to Afghanistan, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve welcomed, which is operating well there.\xc2\xa0 And of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sure obviously the subject of the Korea-U.S. FTA will be a major subject on the trip, but that\'s, I guess, the subject of the briefing in a day or two when we do the econ issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Japan -- the purpose of that stop is the APEC meeting, which Japan is hosting and we will be hosting next year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a broad agenda of political security and economic issues.\xc2\xa0 As Ben mentioned, this is the 50th anniversary of the alliance and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be highlighting that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d say we\xe2\x80\x99re more closely aligned with Japan on strategic issues than we have been at any time since the President came into office.\xc2\xa0 Japan, obviously, has gone through a period of historic change with the election last year, the election of a DPJ -- Democratic Party of Japan -- led government for the first time in modern Japan, except for a brief period in 1994, when any party besides the Liberal Democratic Party has run Japan.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s been a time of transition and a time of some difficulties in Japan.\xc2\xa0 There have been a few prime ministers in our year and a half.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now we are, as I say, more closely aligned than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been at any time -- I would say specifically on the issues of Okinawa, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made considerable progress towards a final base agreement on the relocation of the Marine Air Terminal at the Marine Air Base at Futenma; and also on the issue of the East Asia architecture, where you recall a year and a half ago the Japanese were talking about their own ideas for an East Asia community that did not necessarily include the United States.\xc2\xa0 But now, Japan strongly supports the East Asia Summit and the U.S. decision to participate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our policy has been one of patience and working out whatever differences arise within the context of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 And with Prime Minister Kan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been successful in doing so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issues that I expect to be on the agenda when the President and the Prime Minister meet would be Korea, where we\xe2\x80\x99re closely aligned; Iran, where Japan was really exemplary and a leader in the breadth and scope of the sanctions on Iran that they put in place in the wake of the Security Council resolution; maritime issues in the region; and Afghanistan, where Japan has been the single largest funder of the Afghan police.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, just a word or two on the Asia-related bilateral meetings that we expect.\xc2\xa0 The President will meet with President Hu Jintao of China in Seoul.\xc2\xa0 That meeting will be on November 11th.\xc2\xa0 As has been said, this is the seventh time they\xe2\x80\x99ve met.\xc2\xa0 We expect this meeting to build on the cooperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve established in I think 21 months since President Obama took office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of topics, I think that most likely -- we will undoubtedly talk about economic issues, how we continue to work together to assure the global economy recovers on a balanced and sustainable basis; trade issues.\xc2\xa0 We have differences on issues such as IPR and China\xe2\x80\x99s so-called indigenous innovation policy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about security issues and political issues.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure how many issues will be discussed during the meeting -- there are time constraints -- but issues such as Iran, such as North Korea, such as Sudan, and human rights I would expect to figure in the agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, Australia.\xc2\xa0 As been noted, we\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with Prime Minister Gillard for the first time in Yokohama.\xc2\xa0 The President called Prime Minister Gillard to congratulate her when she was selected after a hotly contested election in Australia.\xc2\xa0 Australia is a close ally.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the President and the Prime Minister will talk about alliance issues.\xc2\xa0 Australia has been very supportive of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Afghanistan, in fact, increased their troop presence in Afghanistan by 40 percent since President Obama came into office.\xc2\xa0 I expect we will talk about economic and trade issues, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations that have been going on, in which Australia and the U.S. are both parties, and other regional issues such as North Korea.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time for a few questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you expect issues of rare earth to come up in the meeting with Hu?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 It could.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say if it will.\xc2\xa0 It depends on time.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, there are a lot of important issues.\xc2\xa0 This is an important issue.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton is going to be seeing State Counselor Dai Bingguo on Hainan Island in China in a few days.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that the issue will come up in either or both.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say for sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I noticed a report today on a statement by the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Technology asserting that China is not manipulating or seeking to manipulate exports of rare earth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lots of reports over the last month or two indicating there have been constraints on Chinese exports.\xc2\xa0 The facts are murky.\xc2\xa0 This is a discussion that -- an issue that Secretary Clinton talked about yesterday with the Japanese Foreign Minister, will be talking about with other leaders, including China.\xc2\xa0 The goal is to ensure that the international market functions without hindrance in ways that satisfies the needs of major producers in the U.S. and elsewhere.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned on the Indonesia leg that education and climate change probably are on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 At every G20, climate change and international assistance has been part of the agenda. And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what impact the U.S. elections and U.S. politics are going to play in the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring these things to the table and to make promises that he was perhaps more freely -- a little more freely made in previous G20s.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 Our commitment to combat climate change is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously continue no matter what the results of the election.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do in our approach to the issue on the international stage is to say that we need a new framework for reducing emissions and that that framework needs to include the United States, as we had kind of been withdrawn from it following the Kyoto process, but it also needs to include emerging economies like China and India and Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 And the Copenhagen Accord of course is the clearest manifestation of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of actions that can be taken.\xc2\xa0 I think through the G20 for instance, it was -- and again, when we do the G20 briefing, Mike Froman will be best positioned to discuss this -- but the phasing out of certain kinds of fossil fuel subsidies was the topic that we\xe2\x80\x99re pushing in the G20 and which we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of actions we can take to strengthen our investments in clean energy at home, to reduce our dependence on oil, and to, again, also reengage on the international stage.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s also a bilateral component to this, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll see on the trip.\xc2\xa0 With India and with Indonesia, for instance, we\xe2\x80\x99ve developed a number of clean energy partnerships that include shared investments, centers of excellence related to clean energy and climate change. And I expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on kind of a bilateral partnership between the United States and Indonesia on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s domestic energy steps that need to be addressed and explored, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak to that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to engage on a bilateral basis, through the G20 and through the framework established in Copenhagen, to continue to try to forge a global accord that can reduce emissions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on the visit to the mosque in Indonesia and the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if, in light of the controversy here over the proposed mosque in lower Manhattan, does the President feel that he needs to send a stronger message of outreach to the Muslim world or repair some damage that perhaps has come out of that debate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I would not conflate the two.\xc2\xa0 When we planned to go to Indonesia in March, we planned to go to this same mosque.\xc2\xa0 I think that when the President visited Egypt, for instance, he traveled to a mosque -- visited a mosque.\xc2\xa0 When he went to Turkey, he visited a mosque.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99s generally\xc2\xa0 -- when he\xe2\x80\x99s visited Muslim-majority countries as President, has often visited the most prominent mosques in the sites that he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that Indonesia, as the, again, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim-majority country, sets a very positive example in terms of both its close relationship with the United States, in terms of its religious diversity and in terms of its democracy, but in a Muslim-majority context.\xc2\xa0 So in many respects, Indonesia sets a very positive example to the world, not simply the Muslim world but to the world more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And so visiting this mosque and in his speech, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to underscore the themes that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in terms of outreach to Muslim communities around the world, but also he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to speak to Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a democracy, Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s rise as an emerging economy, and the pluralism that its story represents -- similar to India\xe2\x80\x99s, in that respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is the speech mostly -- are those, the two themes of the speech, mostly about his Muslim outreach and also Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s place as a tolerant democracy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d say we\xe2\x80\x99ll basically be looking at several themes to the speech.\xc2\xa0 The first, as Jeff described, is what we\xe2\x80\x99re terming a comprehensive partnership, which is a deep and bilateral relationship.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that with President Yudhoyono.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll look at some of the themes of the close ties between the U.S. and Indonesia in his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll also hit on these themes.\xc2\xa0 I think we understand that there will be great interest in Indonesia but also in other Muslim-majority communities around the world in what he has to say.\xc2\xa0 So I think he will hit on some of those themes that he has before in terms of his outreach to the Muslim world in his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And similarly, though, I think we see it\xe2\x80\x99s an important opportunity to hold up Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s emerging democracy.\xc2\xa0 Again, in Southeast Asia, in a part of the world in which there\'s a mix of democracies and states that have not yet embraced democracy, Indonesia sets a positive example and we want to highlight that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think, yes, the bilateral relationship, the outreach to the Muslim world, and also, again, highlighting Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s success as a democracy, as an emerging economy, as a pluralistic society, will be a part of his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be an outdoor venue where ordinary people can attend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an outdoor venue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a big crowd probably for Barack Obama --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Possibly, yes.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t locked in the site, but we\xe2\x80\x99re looking.\xc2\xa0 I think he wanted to speak to -- he\xe2\x80\x99s very popular, as Jeff said, because of his biography, in some respects, and because of his policies in others.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is great anticipation of his visit in Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 And so he wanted to not just have kind of official business.\xc2\xa0 He wanted to have the opportunity to reach more Indonesian people, and that\'s the manner in which we\xe2\x80\x99ve planned the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Korea stop and the speech he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give on Veterans Day, aside from the anniversary and the patriotic occasion, will he use that speech to send any signals to or about North Korea and the transition that\'s underway there and the ongoing threats there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a few things and I know Jeff may want to add, but I think the signal he\xe2\x80\x99ll send is the strength of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 We took some steps after the sinking of the Cheonan, for instance, to underscore this, including the delay of operational control transfer to South Korea, including some of the exercises that Jeff talked about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a stronger message to North Korea and to the world than the alignment of the U.S. in South Korea in terms of our approach to the six-party talks, but also in terms of just the strength of South Korea -- its remarkable economic rise, which stands in very stark contrast to the economic despair that can be found on the northern side of the border.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if you reflect upon the six years that have passed where South Korea and North Korea were basically equally developed six years ago, and now you see a South Korea that is closely aligned with the United States, that has embraced democracy, that has embraced open market reforms, is one of the most dynamic growing economies and powers on the East Asia stage but also the world stage, as evidence by hosting the G20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the message sent to Korea -- North Korea will be one of complete alignment between the U.S. and South Korea at this important juncture, South Korea being a country that\xe2\x80\x99s stronger than it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been, and of the United States being -- not withdrawing from the region but also increasing our engagement both in East Asia, in Korea, and in these international and regional architecture.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 Endorsing what Ben said and just two other points.\xc2\xa0 One is I think that the message that will be sent from the meeting, in addition to what Ben said, is that North Korea needs to understand that it is going to have to take steps not only to address our concerns but South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s; that we stand shoulder to shoulder with South Korea; that North Korea cannot simply take steps towards the United States and think that we will react unless they\xe2\x80\x99re addressing the concerns that South Korea has long had and which are even more intense in the wake of the sinking of the Cheonan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second message, if you will, to use the wording of your question, is that the U.S. would welcome a process with North Korea that leads to North Korea having normal relations with its neighbors and with the United States, and we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 But before that happens, North Korea needs to address with sincerity and with demonstrable behavior the denuclearization issue; that these things are not going to happen -- the benefits that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for are not going to happen until they demonstrate two things, that they are going to improve their relations with the South, and some sincerity on the denuclearization issue, not simply a return to the tactics of the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the 2010 definition of the need for the ongoing, what is it, 30,000-plus U.S. military presence in South Korea?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the -- I mean, what is this era\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the need for this that\xe2\x80\x99s existed for so long there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, we think that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 military presence in the region has been fundamental to its security and stability.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s enabled the peaceful rise of multiple powers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s supported the security of our allies, Japan and Korea.\xc2\xa0 And I think the sinking of the Cheonan demonstrates again the essential need for the United States to remain engaged and sends a strong signal that we are not in any way reducing our commitment to the security of our allies or the region.\xc2\xa0 So I think that that military presence is as necessary as it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a cornerstone of civility and prosperity, and it will continue to be into the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one logistical question.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to the DMZ?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has ever been there, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so, no.\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- with the G20, there\xe2\x80\x99s just not time for that kind of visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, yesterday you talked about the theory of your relationship with China, that there are some things you will agree on, there are some things you disagree on, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to kind of have the relations dominated by disagreements.\xc2\xa0 Some of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s critics are starting to argue that the areas of disagreement with China have actually deepened over the last two years.\xc2\xa0 Could you sort of respond to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, secondly, can you talk about this idea you see in the Asian press quite a lot that the real strategic goal of the U.S. in Southeast Asia particularly is to take advantage of some nervousness among ASEAN countries about China\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about the second question and Jeff is the best positioned to answer on China.\xc2\xa0 I think on Southeast Asia, we see this as a very important region. And I think what we found when we came into office is that the United States had kind of disengaged from Southeast Asia, that you had ASEAN meetings, the preeminent regional forum, that weren\xe2\x80\x99t even attended at a high level by the United States at the end of the previous administration, which sent a signal of U.S. kind of disengagement from the region; and that our reason for engaging is that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s fundamentally in our interest to be a key player in Southeast Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are very dynamic, growing markets from Indonesia to Vietnam to Thailand, and therefore, we want to have deeper economic cooperation with them.\xc2\xa0 These are growing from just emerging economies to the kinds of economies where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to export our goods; we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to support American jobs through our trade relationships with them.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re directly relevant to the United States in that economic respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the security front, this is also a region that has a terrorism issue.\xc2\xa0 There are al Qaeda-affiliated groups in the region such as Jemaah Islamiyah, for instance, in Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 And we have very close counterterrorism cooperation with the Philippines and Indonesia and others to ensure that al Qaeda doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get a foothold in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen them use -- we saw, for instance, the 9/11 plot.\xc2\xa0 You had Kuala Lumpur and other areas where the 9/11 hijackers passed through.\xc2\xa0 So our counterterrorism cooperation in Southeast Asia is directly relevant to our security back here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, we see this as an important region to our interests and to our values.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- on democracy and human rights, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mixed picture in the sense that you have some countries like Indonesia that are embracing democracy and expanding human rights to their citizens, and others like Burma where you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a retrenchment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So across these issues, we see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re a nation and a Pacific power.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that U.S. engagement has been welcomed by the ASEAN countries, as evidenced by the close coordination we have with them at the U.N. in New York when the President hosted the ASEAN leaders.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the broader Asia context that includes our relationship with China and India.\xc2\xa0 But we also see direct engagement with the 10 ASEAN countries as serving its own -- having its own merit and not simply being in the context of our relationship with China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 Just to add to what Ben said, I mean, this has been something we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton went to Indonesia on her first trip abroad in February 2009.\xc2\xa0 She announced that we were acceding to the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which the U.S. had not favored for the previous 25 years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, the President met with the ASEAN 10 leaders in Singapore last year and met with them in New York in September.\xc2\xa0 And the President has announced his intention to join the ASEAN-centered East Asia Summit.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a whole slew of steps from day one.\xc2\xa0 This has been kind of the strategic policy of ours; it\xe2\x80\x99s not been a reaction to events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On China, since day one we have had a clear-eyed and realistic assessment of what can be done in the China relationship.\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- if I can get personal for a moment, I have been doing China for 30 years.\xc2\xa0 And this relationship has never been an easy relationship.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s never been a relationship where everything is on the positive side of the ledger.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s always been a balance sheet of issues we were cooperating on and issues where we were not cooperating.\xc2\xa0 So the attention to some of the areas of difference and some of the areas of friction lately, I understand that, but there\'s nothing new about that, or that in itself is not new.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We came in -- I would say that there are three fundamental pillars, if you will, or principles to how we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with China.\xc2\xa0 Number one, we are seeking, as Ben indicates, to broaden areas of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeking the mantra of a positive, cooperative, constructive relationship.\xc2\xa0 We mean that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the Presidents have met seven times, and the President has met with Wen Jiabao -- Premier Wen Jiabao three times.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- I guarantee you that\'s unprecedented in modern history.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We established the strategic and economic dialogue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been favorable to greater Chinese participation, a greater role in the IMF and World Bank.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with China I think quite well on Iran, on the U.N.-Security Council resolution, which was a stronger resolution than anyone I think inside or outside the government would have anticipated when that process started.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other issues -- the parallel efforts we undertook in 2009 on our stimulus packages to try to restore, revive the global economy -- I think we were the two major players in restoring global growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other issues, like climate change, North Korea, they\xe2\x80\x99re complicated.\xc2\xa0 There have been elements of cooperation, elements of less cooperative conduct in our relationship on those two.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the second principle has been to strengthen our relationships with partners and allies throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 China is part of a broader Asia policy, and we want to shape the context in which China\xe2\x80\x99s emergence is occurring.\xc2\xa0 We want to be a -- we want to assure that China\xe2\x80\x99s emergence, China\xe2\x80\x99s rise contributes rather than detracts from Asian stability, and that\'s not going to happen if we allow our other relationships in the region to fray.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the third thing I\'d mention is our insistence and expectation that China will abide by global norms and international law in its emergence.\xc2\xa0 And I\'d cite as examples of that the approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken on the South China Sea, what Secretary Clinton said in Hanoi at the ASEAN Regional Forum, and a dialogue with them on currency issues and the IMF and the G20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess that\'s a way of saying there\'s not a bumper sticker answer to China policy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated business with things in each column.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re on a good track.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re heading towards a visit by President Hu to the United States in the first part of next year.\xc2\xa0 President Obama and President Hu, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, will be discussing that and the issues on the agenda in their meeting in Seoul.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Indonesia, is the President -- what is the President doing to kind of recognize the time he spent there when he was young?\xc2\xa0 Is he going anywhere that he\xe2\x80\x99s spent time, or whatever?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to speak to it in his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think the speech is the main opportunity for him to speak to his experiences in Indonesia, and I think that will be a key part of his speech, describing the impressions that he had as a young person in Indonesia, the impressions that he\xe2\x80\x99s written about extensively, including in both of his books.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this trip is rather condensed because of just the nature of the schedule and the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s got to get to the G20, which -- so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow a longer period of time for him to potentially visit some of the sites associated with his youth.\xc2\xa0 But I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly speak to it in his speech and his remarks with President Yudhoyono.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think frankly he\xe2\x80\x99ll also, given just the nature of summit schedules -- right, Jeff -- have additional opportunities to visit Indonesia in the years to come, too.\xc2\xa0 So this won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last visit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could -- what are the implications or your interpretation of the apparent dynastic succession in North Korea, Kim Jong Un, in terms of some of these points of friction that you mentioned -- nuclear arms, technology shipments, things of that nature?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 Well, they are clearly in the process of a transition, somewhat early in it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve announced some changes in personnel, but I don\'t think that the final outlines of what it looks like are completely clear or will be clear for some time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our objectives are not geared to personalities or towards particular leaders there.\xc2\xa0 We have policies that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the North Korean regime, regardless of who\xe2\x80\x99s running it, to address -- The amount of speculation, which I\'d rather not do, about whether one individual or another individual would be more likely to be -- to undertake the hard steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- to undertake the steps they\xe2\x80\x99ve been unwilling to take in the past.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the transition closely.\xc2\xa0 We talk to our regional partners about it to try to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, but our policy is not fundamentally geared to whether A or B emerges in charge.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s geared to some principles that we look for the North Korean government to adhere to, regardless.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the transition present an opportunity for an opening?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 As I say, this is -- it would be entirely speculative.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one can argue that before there\'s a transition, there are opportunities; argue that there would be better opportunities after a transition.\xc2\xa0 I, frankly, don\'t take -- I don\'t have a view on that.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think we take a position on that.\xc2\xa0 We are making proposals; we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for them to do things.\xc2\xa0 and if they do them before the transition occurs because the current leader is looking for a legacy, that would be great.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think we can pin a policy on an assumption that that would be the case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on the Japan leg.\xc2\xa0 One, do you expect any sort of U.S.-Japan joint declaration, joint statement on the alliance?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a lot of anticipation on the Japanese side, and was it ever under serious consideration and why did it not make it into the final itinerary?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the second question, the President got this when he was in Japan and, again, I think his view is these are -- he understands the importance to the Japanese people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that he\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in doing at some point in the future.\xc2\xa0 This particular trip, of course, is focused heavily on the APEC meetings, so there\xe2\x80\x99s really just not a lot of time that he has to consider any additional visits beyond kind of the official business that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even really have the chance to consider a broader program in Japan.\xc2\xa0 The only visit he\xe2\x80\x99s doing outside of the official program is at the very end, paying a visit to the Buddhist statue that is in the neighborhood of Yokohama that he visited as a child.\xc2\xa0 So in this particular instance, it was just not something that we considered.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BADER:\xc2\xa0 Joint declaration -- I, frankly, do not expect a joint declaration.\xc2\xa0 As Ben indicated, this is primarily a multilateral visit.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the occasion for a joint declaration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99d add to what Ben said on Hiroshima is that the administration did authorize our ambassador to Japan, John Roos, to attend the anniversary of the bombing last August, and that was the first time an American ambassador had been to an anniversary event.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about the speech the President is going to give in Jakarta and it makes me wonder how you assess the state of the President\xe2\x80\x99s outreach to the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a year and a half maybe since the Cairo speech.\xc2\xa0 Are things better?\xc2\xa0 Are things progressing along the way you had hoped they would by this point?\xc2\xa0 And how do you assess it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things on that.\xc2\xa0 First, obviously the amount of tension, the amount of suspicion that provided the context for the President coming to office between the United States and the Muslim world was very deep and, as he said at the top of the Cairo speech, not the kind of thing that was going to go away with one speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What that speech was trying to do and did is lay out a framework for how the United States and Muslims around the world can move beyond their differences.\xc2\xa0 And I think, frankly, what\xe2\x80\x99s useful in the speech -- to your question -- is the speech essentially has a checklist.\xc2\xa0 He works through an enumerated list of issues and I think on those issues, you can see there\xe2\x80\x99s progress on some and less progress on others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the first instance he discusses the need to combat terrorism and extremism.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some success in terms of degrading al Qaeda and targeting its leadership.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have more to do, particularly as it relates to drawing up the recruitment and the metastasizing of al Qaeda in different place -- even as we continue to target and degrade its leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talked about Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And there I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered on precisely what he promised in Cairo, which is we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed 100,000 troops; we\xe2\x80\x99ve shifted over to Iraqi control and we\xe2\x80\x99ve ended our combat mission and continue to move towards the goal and the agreement that we have with the Iraqis, removing all our troops.\xc2\xa0 So there I think we have seen some good progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He talks in the speech about the Middle East, of course, and the peace process.\xc2\xa0 And that, of course, is -- particularly in the Arab world, but in the broader Muslim world, as well, an issue of huge interest and concern.\xc2\xa0 And there we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen mixed progress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, again, some false starts in our efforts from June 4th, which is the date of the Cairo speech in 2009.\xc2\xa0 But, however, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the promise of the meetings here in Washington and Egypt, in Sharm el Sheikh, between the Israelis and the Palestinians, moving into their first direct talks in some time -- although right now we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to work with the parties to make sure that those talks continue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some loosening of the flow of goods into Gaza, which is of great concern to Arabs and Muslims around the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the other hand, the core issues are not resolved.\xc2\xa0 And so that breeds frustration, as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think on Middle East peace, it\xe2\x80\x99s very much a mixed bag.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On nonproliferation, he spoke about Iran.\xc2\xa0 And there we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, again, Iran has failed to live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen countries, including countries that haven\xe2\x80\x99t traditionally -- have been reluctant to speak out on these types of issues join the international effort, some with sanctions and some just simply with their diplomatic activity, to call upon Iran to meet its obligations.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a broader international coalition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has made clear -- and this is important to, I think, Muslims around the world -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re not singling out Iran here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s obligations as a member of the NPT.\xc2\xa0 And Iran is not being denied anything that any other country would be able to have in terms of peaceful nuclear energy.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99s changed the context a little bit as to how that issue is approached.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then at the backend of the speech, we laid out a number of engagement programs.\xc2\xa0 And some of those are going quite well. We had a very successful entrepreneurship summit here that the President hosted earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, actually, that\'s an interesting story because we brought together entrepreneurs from over 40 Muslim-majority countries to meet with the President, to meet with one another, to meet with U.S. business leaders, to get connected to foundations and the like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what it\xe2\x80\x99s done is it spawned a global process.\xc2\xa0 And there are follow-on summits.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Indonesia is hosting one during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip, because President Yudhoyono has personally gotten interested in the issue of entrepreneurship and partnering with the United States on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Erdogan, despite some of the friction in the U.S.-Turkey relationship, has agreed to host the follow-on global summit on entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s laid the groundwork for a longer-term process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a host of issues related to educational exchanges and science and technological envoys that are discussed at the end of the speech, we feel like we have made progress in laying the groundwork for success.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a mixed bag.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot further to go.\xc2\xa0 And I think the speech is a chance to kind of pick up the thread from the Cairo speech and to discuss where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed -- again, keeping in mind also that our relationship with Indonesia is broader than simply the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a Muslim-majority country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a key economic and security partner for the United States.\xc2\xa0 So it is a bit of a check-in and the speech provides the checklist to hold us accountable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

BADER:\xc2\xa0 I expect Iran will come up in most of the bilateral meetings.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim-majority country, a country that has relations with Iran, a country that\'s an influential actor in the OIC -- the Organization of Islamic Countries -- and whose adherence to sanctions is an important part of the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 So I think that would be context in Indonesia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In China, as I say, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for Chinese enforcement of sanctions, which they were helpful in passing the resolution.\xc2\xa0 And since the resolution has passed, there have been concerns about whether or not, as other countries withdrew their energy investments from Iran, whether China would backfill.\xc2\xa0 And they have not.\xc2\xa0 In the months, since the resolution, we have not seen new announcements or expansion of Chinese energy investments in Iran.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And similarly, Korea and Japan -- I mentioned Japan before, but Korea and Japan took exemplary actions, along with Australia, in terms of the scope of the sanctions that they put in place, the number of entities they covered, banks that were forbidden to do business.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the discussion in those countries will be about sanctions enforcement and how we try to get Iran to change course.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just want to -- as we pivot -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll have one more briefing on the economy, the G20.\xc2\xa0 I think I just want to -- just to put in context what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about today.\xc2\xa0 On this Asia trip, generally speaking, the focus on foreign policy and national security is so often on, understandably, the Middle East and our efforts against terrorism.\xc2\xa0 But I think one of the points we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to underscore is that if you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia -- the rise of individual countries within Asia is one of the defining stories of our time; that this is -- I mean, if you look at where the economic growth is taking place, it is hugely oriented towards Asia.\xc2\xa0 When you look at where -- so if you look at the United States economy and where we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to export our goods and create jobs and deepen our partnerships, it\xe2\x80\x99s very much in Asia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, on the political and security side, when you look at the rise of India and China as global powers and you also look at the emergence of regional powers like Indonesia that are in the G20, these countries are going to play a fundamental role in all these priorities we discussed today, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Iran, non-proliferation, terrorism, nuclear security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point that we want to just make sure we run the thread through these three briefings is why Asia is so much at the center of our foreign policy, because, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental to the economic prosperity of individual Americans, because of the need to balance global growth through our exports there and it\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental to our security in terms of being the basis of our non-proliferation regime and our efforts against terrorism.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just close on that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up the thread with the G20 briefing, which can focus on the balanced global growth agenda, issues related to currency, issues related to the Korea free trade agreement that I know are of great interest to people.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to seeing you on the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
