EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everyone ready?\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions I just wanted to let you know that the President not long ago finished a phone call with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey.\xc2\xa0 He called to congratulate the Prime Minister on his party\'s recent victory in parliamentary elections.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other than that, I would note that the Vice President\'s negotiations with members of Congress on the deficit reduction plans continue today at 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 And that is all I have for you.\xc2\xa0 Fire away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During that phone conversation did they talk about Syria and the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We may have a readout later, but my understanding is this was a fairly brief congratulatory phone call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the agenda is for today, what they\'re going to discuss?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Alister, we have carefully abided by our commitment and I believe the commitment shared by other members in the room not to get into specifics about what\'s happening and what the topics are in the negotiating room, precisely because we think that enhances the chances that they\'ll produce a resolution and an agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk much, Jay, about why the President is traveling to Puerto Rico?\xc2\xa0 What is his trip about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President looks very much forward to making the first official visit of a President of the United States to Puerto Rico in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 The last time was when President John F. Kennedy visited the island in 1961.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are Puerto Ricans who contribute to the United States both who live on the island and -- 4 million on the island, 4 million on mainland -- and he is very interested and looking forward to talking to them, and talking to leaders on the island.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President, in December of 2009, renewed the President\'s -- let me get the name right -- the President\'s Task Force on Puerto Rico\'s Status.\xc2\xa0 He signed an executive order to renew that and to expand it so that the task force would look not only at issues of Puerto Rico\'s status, which is obviously of great interest and concern to Puerto Ricans, but also to economic issues, because Puerto Rico, as you know, was hit hard by the recession, and the President wanted to expand the task force\'s mandate to look at economic issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that task force provided a report to him in March -- if you don\'t have it probably in your materials, the letter he wrote, the attachment that went with it -- but the President noted that the task force provided an important road map to addressing the concerns and aspirations of the Puerto Rican people regarding their status.\xc2\xa0 So he thinks that\'s been an important contribution.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you also talk to us about immigration?\xc2\xa0 Where do we stand with comprehensive immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 Is that likely to come up on this visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that immigration is a planned topic of conversation, but of course, in his meetings with leaders here that could arise.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as you know, Puerto Ricans themselves don\'t have issues of immigration.\xc2\xa0 They\'re free to -- those who live on the island are free to travel to the mainland and are citizens.\xc2\xa0 So the -- but obviously that could be a topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the status of comprehensive immigration reform, the President continues to push very hard for and continues to work through different agencies and through the White House to energize people who are committed to it and hopes very much that Congress will address comprehensive immigration reform in the bipartisan manner and with the bipartisan support it once enjoyed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the debt talks -- yesterday in his interview with NBC he said that -- he said, I don\'t want to see the United States default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 And he said that we could see a reprise of the financial crisis if we play this too close to the line.\xc2\xa0 So is each day that we get closer to August 2nd, does the President think that there is a greater possibility that the debt ceiling won\xe2\x80\x99t be raised?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as a matter of the ineluctable march of time, I think the answer is, yes, that the closer you get to the deadline, the closer you get to the possibility of default.\xc2\xa0 However, the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s losing confidence --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 The second part of my answer is that the logical answer to your question is, of course, the closer we get, the greater the risk.\xc2\xa0 The second part is the President does believe and takes -- as I think he said in the interview yesterday -- that he takes the words of congressional leaders seriously that they are committed to ensuring that we do not default on our obligations, and Congress will take this vote to ensure that we do not throw the U.S. and global economy into turmoil.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he seems to be speaking more hypothetically about this now, as opposed to saying that he won\xe2\x80\x99t let the United States default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I honestly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read too much into that in the sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been very consistent. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all been saying very much the same thing, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not an option to default and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and we take the words of Republican and Democratic leaders in the Senate seriously when they say that we will raise the debt ceiling and fulfill our obligations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would just remind people that the vote to raise the debt ceiling is not a vote for spending.\xc2\xa0 It is a vote to pay our debts, to pay our obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we are the largest economy in the world, the most important economy in the world, absolutely vital to the successful functioning of the financial markets.\xc2\xa0 And this is about being responsible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in that interview, in talking about the budget talks, he also said that Republicans have a difficulty dealing with revenue issues.\xc2\xa0 And short of an overhaul of the tax system, which the Bowles-Simpson commission had discussed but which is a long-term process, what generally does the President look at as potential revenue enhancers that could emerge out of these budget negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Realizing you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be specific, but in terms of what are the areas that -- where revenue exists?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, making clear that I am not discussing what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the room, I think the President has, in the proposal he laid out at George Washington University, made fairly clear where we can find savings through the tax expenditures, and that includes, obviously, not extending again the Bush tax cuts\xc2\xa0 -- unpaid-for Bush tax cuts -- to the wealthiest Americans, millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 It includes ending the $4 billion subsidy to oil companies that we simply -- you cannot plausibly argue that we need that subsidy when oil companies are reporting record profits and gas prices are as high as they are.\xc2\xa0 So those are two areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously there are others that -- loopholes and others that are essentially spending through the tax code.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that, again, with the example of -- the big example being the oil company subsidies, that that kind of loophole should be closed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, yesterday during the Jobs and Competitiveness Council meeting, the President said that with the debt -- with the deficit talks going on, he wants to make sure that the focus is still accelerating the recovery, and he wants to make sure that any compromise includes measures to do that.\xc2\xa0 Was he talking about making sure that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make cuts to investments like education, infrastructure?\xc2\xa0 Or was he saying he wants it to include some of the proposals that he\'s talked about extending from the 2010 tax cut deal, like the payroll -- extending like the payroll tax break, or the bonus depreciation measures?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said about the latter issue is that he is open to ideas.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the employee side payroll tax cut has been an important factor in maintaining economic growth and producing the jobs creation, and that we should certainly look at whether or not that should be extended. That\xe2\x80\x99s an idea.\xc2\xa0 And then others have talked about expanding it to include employer side, and again that\xe2\x80\x99s an idea that\xe2\x80\x99s been -- that\xe2\x80\x99s had bipartisan support in the past; it\'s certainly worth looking at.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the negotiations led by the Vice President I think is an open question that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to answer here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President does approach this with a singular concern, which is that the outcome of the deficit reduction talks produce a result that significantly reduces the deficit while doing no damage to the economic recovery and no damage to our progress in creating jobs -- because if you get that balance right, the agreement itself will, he believes, instill confidence that Washington is getting control of its fiscal matters, and that that confidence will help encourage growth and encourage job creation, if you will, indirectly.\xc2\xa0 But the important -- it is a vital concern of his that we not do anything through these deficit reduction talks that reverses the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, that slows growth or slows job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in the NBC interview, why did the President just not outright say that Anthony Weiner should resign?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was asked this I think in a follow-up question.\xc2\xa0 I think he made clear that he has a lot of things on his plate, a lot of priorities and -- that begin with, the economy, job creation, he mentioned Afghanistan, security of the United States and of Americans everywhere.\xc2\xa0 He expressed his point of view about how he views public service and if it were he, what he would do, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can improve upon the answer he gave.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the IMF, the IMF has put forward two candidates, short-listed -- French finance minister (inaudible.) Does the President endorse either one of these candidates?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have a peculiar Groundhog Day-like obsession with the -- you might call it a fetish -- with the -- sorry, inappropriate word -- but with who will be the next IMF head.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- we are where we were, which is we support a process that will produce the best possible candidate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a story in The New York Times two days -- or yesterday about a meeting he had with CEOs in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was on the public schedule.\xc2\xa0 Why would something like that not have been --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember -- I actually wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in this position.\xc2\xa0 But what needs to be made clear is, contrary to suggestions otherwise, this was not a fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that a President meets with his supporters in the business arena to solicit ideas about how to improve the economy is surely a dog-bites-man story.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that Presidents of both parties have always done.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to say about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 As you know there\xe2\x80\x99s 4.8 million Puerto Ricans in the mainland -- a million more than in the island itself.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message of the -- from the President to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The expert is correcting me. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message to the people of the mainland, of Puerto Ricans in the mainland, that the President wants them to take --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Puerto Ricans on the mainland care very deeply about the island, have relatives, have, in some cases, economic ties.\xc2\xa0 And I think he wants to convey the message to all Puerto Ricans that he is focused on Puerto Rico and its economic development, and on helping Puerto Ricans decide for themselves their status, because I think he made clear in the letter that is attached to the task force\'s report, that ultimately he believes that Puerto Ricans need to be -- the process needs to be put in place that allows them to make the decisions about the island\xe2\x80\x99s status going forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that is of concern to Puerto Ricans not just living on the island but those living on the mainland.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of this is -- is 2012 politics a part of this trip to the island?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is making the first official visit since 1961 of a United States President to the island.\xc2\xa0 He thinks the issue of resolving its status is very important, of dealing with the economic hardships on the island are very important, and he\xe2\x80\x99s very excited about being here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, on the schedule he\xe2\x80\x99s got -- he does have a campaign event, a political event, but there are many elements to this trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said, we have turned this economy around, as she introduced the President.\xc2\xa0 Does he agree with that, this economy has been turned around?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, going back to literal interpretations of that, when he took office, the economy was in a nosedive downward in terms of growth -- severe contraction, something like 6.7 percent contraction in whichever quarter it was; the loss of over 600,000, and I think close to 700,000 jobs -- maybe more than 700,000 in one month.\xc2\xa0 We have for the past seven quarters experienced economic growth.\xc2\xa0 That is a turnaround, reversing the direction of the economy, and obviously created more than 2.1 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 Quite a turnaround from losing, hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is absolutely correct that the trajectory of this economy has turned around.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President makes clear every time he talks about this that we are far from done, that we have a lot of work to do; that the hole that was dug by this recession, by the financial crisis and the greatest recession since the Great Depression is very deep; and that the -- and took many years to dig and will take a significant amount of time to climb out of completely.\xc2\xa0 We lost 8 million jobs because of that recession.\xc2\xa0 And while the creation of more than 2 million private sector jobs is highly significant, it is not enough.\xc2\xa0 The math makes clear that that\'s not enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is focused every day -- every day -- on -- it\'s a conversation he has most frequently with his team, jobs and the economy.\xc2\xa0 So I think it is both wholly accurate to say that we have turned around the trajectory of this economy, the President has since taking office, and entirely accurate to say that he will not rest until we have the right kind of economic growth in a sustained way that produces enough jobs so that every American who wants a job can find one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President watch last night\xe2\x80\x99s Republican debate or any of the highlights from it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President did not watch, as you know, since he was otherwise occupied.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was replaying --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to him this morning, and he did not see any of it.\xc2\xa0 I did not either work on or cover the campaign, but he never watched his own debates, so he\xe2\x80\x99s not spending a lot of time watching other debates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would note as an observer, having caught up with the replay and the -- that it was -- I was struck by the fact that over the course of two hours, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle class\xe2\x80\x9d and the word \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d did not pass anyone\xe2\x80\x99s lips that I heard, which was striking to me because the middle class is obviously, to our mind, the primary focus of everything that we do in terms of the economic policies we pursue and the concerns we have.\xc2\xa0 The middle class not only suffered tremendously during the great recession and is suffering as we emerge from it, but was under a great deal of pressure even prior to the recession.\xc2\xa0 While incomes were growing rapidly under the previous administration and the economy was expanding, middle-class incomes were flat, stagnant, and even dropping.\xc2\xa0 So that was one observation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another is that on -- as the President talks about a lot, education could be "the" key, "the" defining element of whether or not the United States of America can compete globally in the 21st century -- compete and win.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s a high, high priority.\xc2\xa0 And I was struck by the absence of attention to that very key issue last night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you were talking earlier about the areas of savings in the tax code that the President is looking at.\xc2\xa0 Today, the Senate --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- thinking about a very narrow tax hike on journalists, just to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been an expansion in the market lately --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that still apply to you then?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that, as I think most Americans feel, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like paying taxes.\xc2\xa0 Nobody does.\xc2\xa0 But he is committed to the growth of the American economy and the health and welfare of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And as he made the point as somebody who\'s been very fortunate and succeeded financially, that he does not need hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional income through tax cuts that would be paid for by seniors in the cost of their Medicare and health care going up dramatically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway, back to my question --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things on that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President has a comprehensive energy policy and approach to this, and it\'s focused on the development of alternative fuels, domestically developed alternative fuels -- it includes biofuels -- also focusing on increasing domestic production of oil and gas, and on increasing efficiency in our automobiles, which is something we\xe2\x80\x99ll see play out as new, more fuel-efficient cars begin to roll off the assembly line this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that specific issue, we are for reforming it, but we are not for repealing it.\xc2\xa0 And we are for reforming it in a way that can cut costs, but not for complete repeal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leon Panetta went to Pakistan a couple of days ago --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
