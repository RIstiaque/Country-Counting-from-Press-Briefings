Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:50 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here today.\xc2\xa0 Before I go to our regular briefing, I have with me as a guest, Jason Furman, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s chairman -- rather the Chairman of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers.\xc2\xa0 Many of you know him.\xc2\xa0 Today, because of the shutdown, is Jobs Day, as you know, and he\'ll mention that at the top.\xc2\xa0 But I think he also is here to give you a quantitative look at the economic effects of the shutdown that this country experienced and how those effects were negative for the economy and for the American people.</p>\n<p>So I\'ll turn this over to Jason.\xc2\xa0 He will give you remarks at the top.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s here to take your questions about his analysis and other job and economic issues.\xc2\xa0 And then I will return to the podium to take your questions on other subjects.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This morning we found out that the economy added 148,000 jobs in the month of September; the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 And those are both part of a steady, more than three-year trend of job creation and reduction in the unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no question, though, that that pace of job creation is below what we can be fully satisfied with and that the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99d like to be having is a conversation about how we\xe2\x80\x99ll add to jobs.\xc2\xa0 Instead what we did in October was a self-inflicted wound that will subtract from jobs when we eventually learn the jobs number for October.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Normally, economists love Jobs Day because it\xe2\x80\x99s the most recent, fresh look at what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the economy.\xc2\xa0 This Jobs Day was delayed several weeks and, as a result, covers data from September, which was before the very significant changes that happened in October.\xc2\xa0 So one thing we\'ve been trying to get a handle on is what the economic consequences of that economic shutdown and debt limit brinksmanship have been.</p>\n<p>This first slide gives you a number of private sector estimates of the consequences, and they all show that GDP growth in the fourth quarter was reduced by anywhere from .2 to .6.\xc2\xa0 These estimates are useful and informative, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that they\xe2\x80\x99re based on predictions.\xc2\xa0 Basically they say if government services ceased for this amount of time or this amount of money, we have some type of multiplier model:\xc2\xa0 Here is the consequence for GDP.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not based on actual data and they don\'t necessarily capture the full set of effects on confidence, on uncertainty, on things like oil drillers not getting permits, small businesses not getting loans, homeowners not able to get mortgages.</p>\n<p>What we tried to do at the Council of Economic Advisers was look at actual data on the economy -- and the next slide shows some of the data we looked at.\xc2\xa0 These are all indicators that are available on a daily or weekly basis.\xc2\xa0 The most recent set is available through October 12th, so it covers about three-quarters of the shutdown or most of the first half of October.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And these eight indicators all tell a very consistent story: Sales growth, as shown in those first two indicators, slowed in the first half of the month -- and one survey said 40 percent of consumers cut back on their spending because of their uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 UI claims soared by 50,000.\xc2\xa0 The Gallup Job Creation Index slowed.\xc2\xa0 Economic confidence fell to the lowest level in years.\xc2\xa0 Steel production fell, and mortgage applications slowed as well.\xc2\xa0 And we think some of that is certainly a direct effect of the shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we then tried to do was take all of these disparate indicators -- each one of them is individually noisy and tells you only part of the picture -- and try to extract a consistent economic signal from all of these indicators, using something that my colleague, Jim Stock, who\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the Council of Economic Advisers and one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading time series macroeconometricians, calls \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal component analysis\xe2\x80\x9d -- wanted to make sure we got that word in the briefing -- and you see that in this next chart.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The blue line is an index that combines all eight of these variables into a consistent measure of the economy.\xc2\xa0 If you look in the past, it generally tracks job growth and job destruction, so it\'s a reasonably accurate measure of the economy.\xc2\xa0 And one thing you see is that it fell very sharply in the first 12 days of October.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You see similar size, although not quite as sharp, falls the last time we did the debt limit brinksmanship, and the eurozone crisis in 2012.\xc2\xa0 And if you calibrate that fall, you see circled there at the end, it translates into 0.25 percentage points off the fourth quarter growth rate.\xc2\xa0 We\'re 120,000 fewer jobs than we otherwise would have had in the month of October -- and I want to stress that\xe2\x80\x99s just based on the data we have through October 12th.\xc2\xa0 So as we look at more of October, those numbers could change and could potentially get worse.</p>\n<p>This all just really underscores how unnecessary and harmful the shutdown and the brinksmanship was for the economy, why it\'s important to avoid repeating it, and instead consider jobs that are adding to growth, not subtracting.\xc2\xa0 And later today, we will have the report out that provides the mathematical derivation of all of this, for those of you who I know will be turning straight to the appendix of that report, and it will work through all of this.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as I said, it\'s a clear story.\xc2\xa0 You see private sector forecasters; you see it in the actual data that it was a significant and unnecessary self-inflicted wound that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be repeating.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Questions for Jason?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, will this trend continue?\xc2\xa0 We still have the threat of another shutdown.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I certainly hope it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t and there\'s no reason that it should.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now going through regular order with a conference committee on the budget.\xc2\xa0 There\'s time to figure these things out, the significant economic opportunities when it comes to upfront investment in job creation, replacing the sequester in a balanced way, more medium- and long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be urging the conference committee and the Congress to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jason, even if there isn\'t another shutdown, how concerned is the White House that the cumulative effect of a weak September jobs report and the impact that we may have seen over the last three weeks could lead to slowed economic growth through the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think the good news is we\'ve had a private sector that\xe2\x80\x99s really led the recovery throughout this past year. So we\'ve had things like the eurozone crisis, the sequester, the shutdown, the brinksmanship, and throughout it we\'ve continued to see the private sector adding jobs.</p>\n<p>We\'d like to see them adding more jobs, and we\'d like to do what we can to help -- whether it\'s investments in infrastructure, business tax reform -- rather than being an obstacle in the way of that job creation by adding uncertainty and having this type of shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think in September you did see job creation.\xc2\xa0 You saw 148,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 You saw the unemployment rate come down.\xc2\xa0 That\'s consistent with the roughly 2 million jobs a year pace we\'ve had. It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the roughly nearly three-quarters of a point per year reduction in the unemployment rate.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to overstate any of those worries, but again, we want to be pushing this in the right direction, not what we did in October, which was the wrong direction.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With these negative numbers, is there a chance that we could dip back into recession?\xc2\xa0 And what does this do for the global economy?\xc2\xa0 Are we bringing them down as well since it\xe2\x80\x99s a ripple effect around the world?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want anyone to overstate what you see here.\xc2\xa0 You see 0.25 off the growth rate.\xc2\xa0 You see 120,000 fewer jobs for October.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the shutdown and the brinksmanship associated with the debt limit are moving us in the wrong direction.\xc2\xa0 But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the type of catastrophic economic effects that we would have risked had we actually hit the debt limit and defaulted on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 So we didn\xe2\x80\x99t go all the way to the end of what we might have.\xc2\xa0 But even getting close to it is moving you in the wrong direction, not the right direction.</p>\n<p>Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to lose that big-picture trend.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had 43 straight months of job growth.\xc2\xa0 That unemployment rate has come down steadily.\xc2\xa0 But we just can\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied with where it is, and we want to be doing more to move it in those right directions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what about global impact?\xc2\xa0 What is the global effect?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Certainly we heard from the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde, I think last weekend, and a number of others that this had global economic ramifications.\xc2\xa0 And I think we are very -- we\xe2\x80\x99re still a leader in the world economy.\xc2\xa0 We still have among the strongest growth rates of any of the comparable countries.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re still a key force in driving that global economic growth.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything to imperil that or change that.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why the President is out there urging that we don\xe2\x80\x99t repeat anything like this shutdown, anything like this debt limit brinksmanship.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Jason, do you see any economic impact this early on with the problems with the healthcare.gov website and the signups?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, or do you think that that would have no negative effect as long as the problem is improved by, say, the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think when it comes to the website, as you know, people are working around the clock to fix that, and the enrollment process is a six-month process, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re focused on in that regard, economically.\xc2\xa0 If you ask me, I think the things that matter most in the Affordable Care Act for the economy is that health premiums are now growing at their slowest rate in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 I think that helps businesses and helps job creation; it also helps wages.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have people locked into a business because they need to keep their insurance.\xc2\xa0 People are more free to move from jobs to jobs.\xc2\xa0 That helps them match with the job where they\xe2\x80\x99re most productive, get a raise, and help entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing more affordable and new options for small businesses.</p>\n<p>So I think taken as a whole, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the Affordable Care Act being good for the job market, good for the economy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about healthcare.gov in the past three weeks changes that bigger story.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 John.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay, and thank you, Jason.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve twice mentioned sequestration, in fact, putting it on a par with the eurozone crisis and the recent government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Do you have hard evidence that the cuts in sequestration are a negative effect on the recent jobs situation that you described and are causing a diminished job creation in the private sector?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think a reasonable estimate comes from the Congressional Budget Office, and they said that the sequester would cost us 750,000 jobs over the course of a year.\xc2\xa0 That works out to be about 60,000 fewer jobs per month.\xc2\xa0 And think how different this month\xe2\x80\x99s report would have been if you had had an extra 60,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has testified, referring to similar numbers for the impact of sequester, and a number of private sector forecasters have seen that as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think if you look at the pattern of growth or job creation over the course of the year, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly consistent with those types of estimates from CBO and others.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m mildly confused by your statistics.\xc2\xa0 You say a 0.25 drop in growth, and then you say a loss of 125,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 If we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost the 0.25 in growth, are you saying we would have gained 125,000 jobs, in which case, were you predicting a growth of 400,000 jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear about two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about October, so the data we saw today was for September.\xc2\xa0 So this is about October.\xc2\xa0 And second of all, this is a change from what otherwise would have happened.\xc2\xa0 So if we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a shutdown and we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had the debt limit brinksmanship, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go out on a limb and predict we would have had X jobs created in the month of October.\xc2\xa0 As a result of it, we will now have X minus 120,000 jobs created in the month of October.\xc2\xa0 So this is the delta, or, in other words, a measure of the cost of the shutdown and the brinksmanship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The growth rate, the same thing:\xc2\xa0 If you look, private sector forecasters had forecasts of growth for the fourth quarter; most of them have published new forecasts.\xc2\xa0 Their new forecasts are .2 to .6 of a percent lower than what their old forecasts were.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re still forecasting positive growth for the fourth quarter, for example, but less than they were before.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jason.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.</p>\n<p>We now return to our regular programming, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Julie Pace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just had one question on a separate topic.\xc2\xa0 Amnesty International released a report today on U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 It has new details about civilian victims, including a 68-year-old grandmother who was hit while farming with her grandchildren.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how the White House sees these types of reports squaring with the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments that the U.S. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t conduct drone strikes unless there is near certainty that no civilians are killed, and also, what the President plans to say about these drone strikes when he has his meeting with the Pakistani leader tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me start with the beginning of your question, to say that we are reviewing these reports carefully.\xc2\xa0 As a part of his commitment to transparency, in a comprehensive address at NDU on May 23rd of this year, President Obama laid out the legal and policy framework for the U.S. counterterrorism strategy.\xc2\xa0 The President directly addressed the issue of civilian casualties in that speech and he made clear that it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties -- a risk that exists in every war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He also made clear that there is a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties and nongovernmental reports.\xc2\xa0 To the extent these reports claim that the U.S. has acted contrary to international law, we would strongly disagree.\xc2\xa0 The administration has repeatedly emphasized the extraordinary care that we take to make sure counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, he addressed why the United States may choose to undertake strikes using drones.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cConventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones and are likely to cause more civilian casualties and more local outrage.\xc2\xa0 Invasions lead us to be viewed as occupying armies, unleash a torrent of unintended consequences, are difficult to contain, result in large numbers of civilian casualties and ultimately empower those who thrive on violent conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>U.S. counterterrorism operations are precise, they are lawful, and they are effective.\xc2\xa0 And the United States does not take lethal strikes when we or our partners have the ability to capture individual terrorists.\xc2\xa0 Our preference is always to detain, interrogate, and prosecute.\xc2\xa0 We take extraordinary care to make sure that our counterterrorism actions are in accordance with all applicable domestic and international law and that they are consistent with U.S. values and U.S. policy.</p>\n<p>Of particular note, before we take any counterterrorism strike outside areas of active hostilities, there must be near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured, and that is the highest standard we can set.\xc2\xa0 I think we have demonstrated in the policies that we\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted and the strategies that we develop and execute that we take the matter of civilian casualties enormously seriously and that the actions that we take, we take mindful of the absolute need to limit civilian casualties and to, in this case, reach a standard of near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured, which is the highest standard we or any country could set.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the strikes that are still ongoing meet that standard?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am confident that -- again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak about specific operations but that the policies that the President spoke about in his speech at NDU, when they are executed, meet international and domestic legal obligations and meet the standards set of near certainty that I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President has committed to undertaking these activities with the greatest possible transparency and we will continue to share as much information as possible about them with the American people, the Congress, and the international community, consistent with our national security needs and the proper functioning of the executive branch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, the House Oversight Committee asked what role the White House Chief Information Officer and Chief Technology Officer had in the rollout of healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain to us how they were involved and when they became aware that there were all these problems?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, as I mentioned yesterday and the President mentioned in the Rose Garden, we are focused right now in the administration on identifying and fixing the real problems that exist with the healthcare.gov website.\xc2\xa0 And HHS and CMS have launched a tech surge that is well underway, bringing some of the most talented experts to bear on this problem, and they\'re working 24/7 on fixing the website.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in Monday-morning quarterbacking.\xc2\xa0 I think the President acknowledged, and I acknowledged yesterday that he is not and we are not and no one in the administration is satisfied by the performance of the website thus far and the consumer experience that it\xe2\x80\x99s provided.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused, however, on improving it because the goal here was not to build a website; the goal was to create marketplaces for insurance that would make it possible for millions of Americans, for many of whom for the first time in their lives -- the ability to purchase quality health care or health insurance at prices they could afford.</p>\n<p>And we understand and we acknowledge the problems that consumers are experiencing and have experienced with the website. Every day improvements are being made.\xc2\xa0 I discussed some of them yesterday; so did the President.\xc2\xa0 Every day we are seeing more indications of more and more Americans getting access to affordable health insurance that they did not have before.</p>\n<p>I would point you to the news out of Ohio yesterday, the significant decision taken there, a state with a Republican governor, which is now joining other states with Republican governors to adopt the expansion of Medicaid, which will provide insurance to several hundred thousand -- I don\'t have the number right here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant number of Ohioans who did not otherwise have access to affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the real Americans out there who have a high interest in and demand for the product that the marketplaces is providing.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s on us the fact that the website has not functioned as effectively as it should.\xc2\xa0 It is also the reason why we have made clear that there are other avenues available to Americans with this deep interest in finding affordable health insurance to shop for that insurance and to sign up for an apply for that insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s happening.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, we have an enormous number of -- not an enormous number, but a number of very qualified people involved in the process of making improvements, identifying problems, isolating them and fixing them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the White House cooperate with this committee?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We cooperate with all legitimate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 I would note that, as the President said yesterday, rooting for failure in this case, no matter how much you violently oppose the Affordable Care Act, perhaps even if you voted 45 times to repeal it or defund it or sabotage it in some other way, perhaps if you even voted to shut the government down and cause all that economic harm to the American people because you are so opposed to a bill and a law that provides affordable health insurance to millions of Americans, you ought not celebrate the fact that Americans might be struggling with a website that will provide them information about obtaining that insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We should be focused on those Americans.\xc2\xa0 The struggles they may be having with the website pale in comparison to the struggles they\xe2\x80\x99ve had lacking affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what this policy is about.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not about who is to blame for glitches in a website.\xc2\xa0 What we need to focus on is fixing those problems, making the information that the American people want available to them in an efficient way.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, Jay, the Saudis -- Prince Bandar is saying there\'s going to be a major shift in Saudi relations away from the United States.\xc2\xa0 How seriously do you take this?\xc2\xa0 Are you seeking more information about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that Secretary Kerry has spoken at length about this today, coming out of meetings with the Saudi Foreign Minister, and they had candid and productive discussions on these issues -- rather when they met yesterday in Paris.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have a longstanding partnership and consult closely on a range of regional, political and security issues, including Iran, Syria, the Middle East peace process, and Egypt.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of Prince Bandar\'s comments, I would refer you to him for an explanation of them.\xc2\xa0 On core national security issues, the United States and Saudi Arabia have a very strong and stable relationship.\xc2\xa0 And while we do not agree on every issue, when we have different perspectives, we have honest and open discussions.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I can point you to very constructive, positive meetings that the Secretary of State had with his Saudi counterpart in Paris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow on Saudi?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Follow on Saudi, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a particular reaction to Saudi Arabia rejecting a seat on the U.N. Security Council?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 A seat on the United Nations Security Council affords member states the opportunity to engage directly on issues of great importance, including issues like Syria, Iran, Egypt and the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not Saudi Arabia takes a seat on the Security Council is, of course, its own decision.\xc2\xa0 We will continue our close bilateral cooperation with Saudi Arabia on the host of shared challenges we face, including those issues that the Security Council takes up directly.</p>\n<p>Again, we have disagreements with Saudi Arabia on some issues, but we work through them and discuss them in honest and open conversations.\xc2\xa0 We also have a core relationship in national security areas that is very stable and important to U.S. interests, as well as Saudi interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the website, many of the states seem to be doing better with the website.\xc2\xa0 One of the key things, at least in Kentucky, we\'re being told, is that they do not require someone to enroll first before shopping.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a structural difference than what happens in the federal website.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House considering -- or is the department considering changing that structurally in order to help improve the performance?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you asked.\xc2\xa0 As a matter of fact, the night before last -- overnight and beginning yesterday morning -- Americans across the country, when they log onto -- or rather when they go onto the website, can type in their ZIP code and shop and browse, and see what the options are that are out there available to them to comparison-shop and begin to make decisions. And then, the website itself, which contains numerous improvements -- the homepage that I mentioned yesterday has that, but also allows -- right upfront makes clear to users that they can make a toll-free call to get questions answered on their options.\xc2\xa0 They can enroll by phone, by mail, online or in person.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the answer to your question is, yes, Americans can do this by typing in their ZIP code.\xc2\xa0 And they can also access a calculator, a tax calculator from the website that will give them an estimate of what tax credits may be available to them to apply to their premiums depending on their income levels.</p>\n<p>I just think the question goes right to the heart of the matter when it comes to the efforts we\'re undertaking to improve the website.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said yesterday, you\'ll get no argument from me or anyone else here that there are problems and there were problems that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re improving the experience for consumers every day, and we won\'t rest until Americans who want to get more information about the affordable health care options available to them through the website are able to do that smoothly, and are able to register and sign up.</p>\n<p>It\'s also important to note, Jim, that even though we\'ve had these issues, people are signing up.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s both in the state exchanges -- some of which have reported a great deal of success -- and in the exchanges run at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 And those individuals are what this is all about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And whether -- it is unacceptable to the President that these problems exist on the website, and he wants them fixed.\xc2\xa0 He made that clear yesterday. He does not at all like or accept the fact that some Americans are out there having to spend a lot of time on a website that should be operating more efficiently.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is, when you\'re able to enroll in and purchase insurance affordably for you and your family for the first time, the struggles that you went through with a website pale in comparison to the fear and struggle that you endured when you did not have any insurance or could not afford it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s not an excuse, but I think it helps put in perspective what the Affordable Care Act is all about when we\'re having these questions and issues, which are understandable, with regards to the website.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that yesterday and today -- you\'re not about pointing fingers and not about doing that at this point -- but that is a structural change, is it not?\xc2\xa0 What you\'ve just described, reflecting what other states are doing by not forcing you to log in first?\xc2\xa0 Are there other structural changes, not just -- so that it wasn\'t just the amount of people who were logging in -- although that may be a factor -- there were structural problems.\xc2\xa0 Are there other structural problems that are now being addressed by the government?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the experts who are working on this are identifying, I think, technical problems and addressing them.\xc2\xa0 They\'re identifying -- I don\'t think that\'s necessarily a structural problem -- but identifying ways to make the user experience more efficient and effective for consumers.\xc2\xa0 And in every case, they\'re isolating, identifying and fixing the problems that they find.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have a lot of work to do, no question.\xc2\xa0 The experience is better, but it is not nearly good enough.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, improvements are being made, and improvements were necessary and remain necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The important thing is that in this six-month period, open enrollment period, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be time for all those millions of Americans for whom these marketplaces were built to look at the options available to them and make a choice about whether or not they -- what kind of insurance they can purchase with the kind of quality coverage that they desire and in many cases have not been able to get in the past.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a fact that the requirement you just mentioned as having been changed a day or two ago was, in fact, in the original plan, and at the last minute or as close to the last minute before the website debuted, the White House insisted that people who are going on the web have to file their application first before seeing a menu of plans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, again, I don\'t know -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that went into the development of the website and all the specifications and how it operates that exceed my brief.\xc2\xa0 I am not a computer expert.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t build websites.\xc2\xa0 But what I can I tell you is that where there -- the goal is to get insurance affordably to the millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 So every step that we can take to make that process easier, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make.\xc2\xa0 And again, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to find an argument from me that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an enormous amount of room for improvement here.\xc2\xa0 And that is why we\xe2\x80\x99re tackling these problems head on, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging these problems head on, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re also making clear to all those millions of Americans for whom the debate about who\xe2\x80\x99s to blame for a problematic website is of far less interest than the question of how do they get quality, affordable health insurance for the first time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to answer that question, principally.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though you don\'t do IT, maybe you can tell me whether -- the contractors on the outside are telling us and others that there was a lot of pressure from the White House, despite many known problems, to start on October 1st and not to miss the date.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, when it comes to contractors and testing and all that sort of thing, I would direct you to HHS, which is obviously running the site as well as the principal when it comes to the Affordable Care Act in general.</p>\n<p>The launch date was October 1st.\xc2\xa0 The website has not performed up to the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectations or anyone\xe2\x80\x99s expectations to this point.\xc2\xa0 It is improving.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on continuing to make improvements to the website so that the Americans that it serves and that the Affordable Care Act was designed to serve are getting the benefits that they deserve.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned -- just one more -- you mentioned that you welcome legitimate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 What other kind is there?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some that isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that about this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with -- what is this, Chairman Issa\xe2\x80\x99s committee?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you regard that as not legitimate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- find that illegitimate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, nothing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that we cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say frequently.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Health and Human Services has engaged with Congress numerous times and will continue to engage with Congress numerous times on these and other issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I think everybody here who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born yesterday has seen questionable congressional oversight in the past.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying in regard to this issue, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying in the past.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 We have a report out now that Jeff Zients is being tapped by the President -- has been tapped by the President to help repair the health care website.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wonder if you can talk a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to do that.\xc2\xa0 Is this now to put a central person or face behind this effort so that people know who is in charge?\xc2\xa0 And does this in any way sideline Secretary Sebelius?\xc2\xa0 And why did the President decide to tap Jeff Zients?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can confirm your report and I understand that HHS is now announcing some key steps, including the fact that it is bringing in management expert and former CEO, Jeff Zients, onboard to work in close cooperation with the HHS team to provide management advice and counsel to the project.\xc2\xa0 As those of you know who know Jeff, he\xe2\x80\x99s an expert in the field of effective management.\xc2\xa0 And HHS will be tapping his experience and expertise as they address the challenges that have come up with the administration of the website.</p>\n<p>As you know, Jeff has led some of the country\xe2\x80\x99s top management firms, providing private sector companies around the world with best practices in management strategy and operations. He has a proven track record here as acting director at the Office of Management and Budget and, previously, as serving as the United States Chief Performance Officer.</p>\n<p>Working alongside HHS\xe2\x80\x99s team and using his rich expertise and management acumen, Jeff will provide short-term advice, assessments and recommendations.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\'ll be coming here in the beginning of the year as director of the National Economic Council.\xc2\xa0 This is a short-term assignment for HHS.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following on what Bill was asking about with some of the problems before the launch, in this Washington Post report, if you could react, they\'re saying that the administration before the launch, days before, tested a key part of the website with a few hundred people -- a simulation of a few hundred people logging on and the system crashed, even though, as you have been touting, you were expecting millions of people\xc2\xa0 -- you didn\'t know how many, but many, many people trying to log on. So was anyone in the White House informed at that time, days before the launch, that this key test had failed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, first of all, let me just make clear that we are expecting that by the end of the six-month enrollment period that millions of Americans will have enrolled to get affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 We never said, and never would have said, and never expected or predicted that we would get millions of people in the first days or weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it abundantly clear --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just great interest in it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, over many, many days now, three weeks now, even though for several of them we were focused on the extreme damage Republicans were doing to the economy through the shutdown and brinksmanship, occasionally we would get questions about the Affordable Care Act and the website, and we noted -- and I noted many times that the interest levels, the demands as measured by the number of visitors to the site far exceeded what we expected.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, there\'s no question that that\'s on us and that we need to fix these problems that have been identified and, in some cases, created by the significant volume of interest.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no question, again, that the website that was launched on October 1st has not performed adequately.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I\'m not familiar with the testing that was done.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to HHS for that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we are fully aware of the fact that even though it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better every day, the website has not performed in the manner that we expected it to perform.\xc2\xa0 We knew there would be glitches.\xc2\xa0 We did not expect the volume and we did not expect the kinds of problems that we have seen.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why, at the President\'s direction, we are addressing this problem 24/7.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it seems like a big deal that days before the launch, this test is done with hundreds of people and the system crashes.\xc2\xa0 My question was, was anyone at the White House informed of it?\xc2\xa0 Was the President informed of that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t know about any specific tests and I would send you to HHS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take the question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is what I told you yesterday, is that we believed, from the President on down at the White House, that the website when it launched would function far more effectively than it did and has.\xc2\xa0 And while there would be glitches, as there always are with a launch of websites of this nature, of this complexity, in its initial stages, we did not anticipate the magnitude of the problems that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re focusing so much attention and effort and expertise on addressing those problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday and you today talked about a tech surge and these IT experts who are coming in.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House going to provide a list of who these people are or what corporations they work for?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the tech surge was announced by CMS and HHS, so I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 I think they have announced today that Jeff Zients is part of that surge.\xc2\xa0 But for more information about them -- I think we\'ve identified that some are coming from the private sector; some of them are members of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program; some come from within government.\xc2\xa0 But for more information about that, I would refer you to HHS, mindful of the fact that these individuals are focused on identifying and fixing problems so that Americans can more effectively get access to the information they need so that they can sign up for and enroll in insurance plans.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to focus on fixing the problems right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if these individuals work for companies that have business before the White House, business before the Congress, do you think, in the interest of transparency, it would be a good idea to list the people and their companies?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At this point, Ed, I just don\'t have more information than I gave you.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to HHS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last one on that then.\xc2\xa0 What is your estimate on how much more money it\'s going to cost then to fix the website and implement the early stages?\xc2\xa0 It\'s already hundreds of millions of dollars that have been laid out, have been disclosed. What\'s your new estimate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The budget for this is something that\'s housed over at HHS, and I would refer you to them, including the expenses related to the website. Two, it is important to note -- although it is rarely noted, certainly in some places -- that the Affordable Care Act, as it is implemented, as measured by the Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office as well as others, will reduce our deficits in the first 10 years, and then significantly in this next 10 years.</p>\n<p>We are already seeing benefits from the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act when it comes to slowing the growth in our health care costs.\xc2\xa0 The three slowest years of health care cost growth have been the last three years\xc2\xa0 -- three slowest in the previous half-century.\xc2\xa0 And all of these data I think contradict some of the predictions and even current charges by critics of Obamacare when they say that it\'s going to explode health care cost growth when the opposite has been true.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey say that they\'re focused now on the website, but a charge that they constantly make and that seemed to be unchecked even when they make it in press conferences and interviews is that it\xe2\x80\x99s causing increases in part-time workers.\xc2\xa0 Well, even today\xe2\x80\x99s job\xe2\x80\x99s data from September disproves that.\xc2\xa0 So, in fact, in this recovery, job creation -- and since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, job creation has been consistent with or above -- when it comes to full-time job creation during this recovery, the percentage of full-time jobs versus part-time jobs has been at the level of previous recoveries or greater than previous recoveries -- again, disproving a charge that seems to be made, regularly unchallenged.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To change the subject a little bit, in light of the latest Greenwald-Snowden leaks, can you update us on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s latest efforts to return Mr. Snowden back to the U.S. to face charges?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no updates to give.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that is a matter of discussion between Russia and the United States.\xc2\xa0 The Russian government knows our position very well.\xc2\xa0 It has not changed.\xc2\xa0 But I have no updates on those conversations.</p>\n<p>Mara, Peter, Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said at the end of six months, you expect millions of Americans will sign up.\xc2\xa0 Do you still expect the 7 million that you had predicted?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t remember precisely what -- we have no changes in our expectations about the number of people who --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you still expect that 7 million will be --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If that\'s the figure, I believe that\'s correct, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then the second question, in the past when you had a natural disaster, the oil spill, generally, there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody in charge, and I guess Jeff Zients is going to be that person.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be taking over a kind of briefing role where he answers the questions and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s providing management advice and consultation.\xc2\xa0 But for more details about his role, because he\xe2\x80\x99s being brought on by HHS, I would refer you to HHS.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this is a manmade -- this is not a natural disaster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I know that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is -- one of the frustrations has been it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get information about exactly what went wrong and what\xe2\x80\x99s being done to fix it, and there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a kind of daily update on that from somebody who is well versed in the technical aspects of this.\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t anticipate him doing that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Beyond what I just confirmed and announced, I would refer you -- beyond those details about what Jeff will be doing, I would refer you to HHS and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they have other information about the efforts they\'re making.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the location of these efforts, and Jeff will be joining the existing team.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And one last question.\xc2\xa0 Without describing exactly what did go wrong, do you feel that at this point the White House has a good handle on what went wrong and understands the problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am going to say that we have experts working on this, and that the President won\'t be satisfied until he believes that the website is functioning effectively for American consumers and he is insisting on practices that enable Americans to get the information they need, not just from the website, and to be able to sign up and enroll, not just on the website, but through the other three avenues available to them -- by phone, through in-person consultations and by mail.</p>\n<p>So I\'m not going to make any predictions.\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply going to say that as problems are identified, we have a team of people fixing them, and they\'re going to keep at it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that progress has been made.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of folks who are reporting on this steadily have noted that progress.\xc2\xa0 But much more needs to be done, and we\'re hard at work on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not able to say at this point that you -- that the White House has a handle on what the problem is?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have a lot of information about what the problems are, and we\'re working on them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\'re going to presume to know everything that may or may not happen technologically in the weeks and months ahead.\xc2\xa0 No one would do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking what\xe2\x80\x99s happening --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President feels confident that he is -- that there is a team working on this that has the expertise necessary to identify the problems and fix them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up very briefly on that -- so, in simple terms, we have not yet fully identified what all of the problems are?\xc2\xa0 We\'re still in the process of identifying the problems before we can initiate --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, all I\'m saying -- again, not as an expert in the field -- that on any website that you visit, you may encounter a glitch or a problem.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\'re going to get to a day where we would declare that there will never again be a problem experienced by or a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish and answer Peter\'s question -- that there will never again be a glitch or a problem.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on identifying the problems -- or the team is identifying the problems, isolating them and fixing them, making improvements to the site, making improvements to the consumer experience.\xc2\xa0 Because this is about connecting those Americans who lack affordable health insurance with the options that are now available to them that can provide them that affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 So that includes via the website, but also through the call-in centers, the in-person centers and by mail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to keep working on this problem.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not satisfied with where it was when it was launched and where it has been, although we have seen important improvements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has been sort of the communicator-in-chief in terms of our understanding of the way ACA, the Affordable Care Act works and the problems that exist.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke on October 1st, spoke again yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Should we anticipate we will hear constant updates from him as we reach that place when he can finally say, we have fixed it, it\xe2\x80\x99s all good to go from here?\xc2\xa0 What should we anticipate to hear from the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have events or -- I would simply say that this is obviously something the President is focused on, but he is also focused on other issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He is committed to working with Congress to try to get comprehensive immigration reform passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 He is committed to the congressional effort and the help we can provide to it through regular order and the budget process to reaching an agreement on a broader budget deal with Congress, with Republicans and Democrats in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he believes, as he had mentioned last week, that, similarly, there is the opportunity to pass and sign into law a bipartisan farm bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s just some of the things that continue to get the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus and attention -- there are obviously many issues -- within the budget context.\xc2\xa0 And I think Jason mentioned this earlier -- there is the opportunity, as the President has identified, to make policy choices that will improve economic growth and improve job creation, which is his number-one focus and should be, in his mind, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s number-one focus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We saw jobs numbers for September that demonstrated steady job growth but not enough job growth, in our view.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve now gone through a period where Congress, because of its obsession with -- at least the tea party\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with Obamacare -- we saw a shutdown and the threat of default that did direct, measurable harm to the American people and the American economy. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to knock that off and focus instead on doing the things that they can do to help the economy grow and help it create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Simply put, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- when it comes to a sophisticated rollout like this with a website, phones, call-in centers, all this, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the private sector do this better than government does?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is we have experts from the private sector as well as from government and academia working on this problem, or the problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act -- as you know, the marketplaces that are created by it are marketplaces for private insurance companies to sell their products to the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is, by design, a system that builds on the existing private insurance market.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such an increase in the number of options available and plans available to consumers is that insurance companies are attracted to the potential market there of millions more Americans purchasing insurance.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re building on the competition created by the marketplaces to expand the number of insured Americans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Briefly, when we wrapped up yesterday, you guys introduced the conversation relating to the shooting that took place in Nevada.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t get a lot of detail in terms of the way the President was advised of what had taken place there.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction of learning of another shooting, a deadly shooting, in a school, with the loss of a heroic teacher, as he\xe2\x80\x99s being described today, and the frustration for this President in his inability to do anything more about it, just one day later and going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think we noted when we put out the transcript of the briefing, the President was briefed on the shooting in Nevada.\xc2\xa0 And I can just say that in every instance like this, he\xe2\x80\x99s heartbroken, and his thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and everyone in that community.</p>\n<p>And with regards to the need to take action on common-sense measures that reduce gun violence, the President remains committed to doing just that.\xc2\xa0 And we made no secret of the fact that the President was very disappointed in the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pass a bill that would have expanded and improved our background check system, that would have in no way infringed upon Americans\xe2\x80\x99 Second Amendment rights, a bill that was supported by majorities of the American people in every state in the country where a poll was taken, and that includes the reddest states in the nation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep at it and keep looking at ways that we can take these common-sense steps to reduce gun violence in America.</p>\n<p>Ari.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Twenty-five states have agreed to the Medicaid expansion now.\xc2\xa0 I think Ohio was the 25th.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a plan to encourage or push, or a strategy to get the other 25 to agree to that?\xc2\xa0 Or do you view that more as a state-by-state issue where the governors and the politics there will work themselves out?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously supported and signed the Affordable Care Act, which, as originally legislated, would have required every state to expand its Medicaid program.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court decision changed that piece of the Affordable Care Act and made it optional.\xc2\xa0 So we are working, I would say, on a state-by-state basis, to do our best to impress upon governors and legislatures the benefits to their constituents, to the people of their states, of expanding Medicaid in the way that the Affordable Care Act does.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously pleased with developments in Ohio and in states across the country where the decision to expand Medicaid has been made, because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a significant number of uninsured Americans who will now have insurance, and that creates enormous benefits for those states in terms of reducing costs in emergency rooms and in creating more security for their citizens, and which, in turn, enhances their prospects in the job market and can help economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep at it.\xc2\xa0 I think that the effort is both broad and narrow in the sense that we speak about the benefits of expanding the Medicaid program broadly, but we obviously have conversations with individual governors and other significant players in the states themselves where this decision has not yet been made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie and -- oh, Brianna, then Jackie, then Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said there are improvements on the website.\xc2\xa0 What are the improvements?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- but I will -- repeat what I said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 As we just mentioned -- well, as I mentioned yesterday, you can now preview -- this was effective beginning yesterday morning -- you can now preview plans and prices available in your area without filling out the online application.\xc2\xa0 This goes to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 You can find out, with an improved calculator, whether your income and household size may qualify you for lower costs on your monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs.\xc2\xa0 You can apply for coverage four ways:\xc2\xa0 by phone, online, by mail with a paper application, or with the help of an in-person assister.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Some of the features on the website existed before, but they are now made more effective and prominent for users who go to healthcare.gov, because the ones that assist users in finding out how they can get information through the other means rather than the website are more prominently featured.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the first step is registering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Brianna, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t register as we speak.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, you can now preview plans and prices available in your area without filling out the online application.\xc2\xa0 So this goes -- we just had this discussion, Jim and I, and he correctly noted that this change was made to make it easier for people who want to shop and browse and get information, to do that without encountering the difficulties that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had registering.\xc2\xa0 So they can do that.\xc2\xa0 Then they --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when can you register?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Brianna, again, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me are there still troubles with the website, the answer is emphatically yes.\xc2\xa0 The situation is getting better.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that every day.\xc2\xa0 And I daresay that if the statistics that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reported are true, for every experience that has been difficult when it comes to using the website, there is at least one person out there, and one person who may represent a family, who successfully signed up for the health insurance options that had not been available to them in the past.</p>\n<p>But to your point, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it easier for people to use the website to get the information they need about the plans and options available to them, to find out what credits may be available to them.\xc2\xa0 And then they can use -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re having trouble going further in the process on the website, they can apply by phone or by mail or in person.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a really complicated process.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems young people aren\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Brianna, but you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right, but you know what\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s more complicated --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my question is about young people --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- getting insurance today, prior to the existence of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is about young people.\xc2\xa0 Are they really going to want to jump through all of those hoops?\xc2\xa0 And don\xe2\x80\x99t you kind of want to encourage them to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I agree.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in an all-out effort to improve the online experience, and as we do that, to make available information about other means to sign up.\xc2\xa0 But again, the struggles that people are encountering in trying to -- and the enormous numbers of people who are interested in the Affordable Care Act and the options available to them, and the troubles they\xe2\x80\x99re having with the website, pale in comparison to the trouble you have when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it create a problem where if you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of back-loading all of the young people -- I mean, you want to encourage them to sign --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not back-loading the young people.\xc2\xa0 We are encouraging them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they won\xe2\x80\x99t wait until they can register, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear when that\xe2\x80\x99s even going to happen.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Brianna, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me, does the website work effectively?\xc2\xa0 The answer is, not effectively enough.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you logged to the website since the changes have been made?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have, yes.\xc2\xa0 I did, yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have updates on his --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you register?\xc2\xa0 I mean, did you succeed in --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get insurance through my employer, so, no, I did not register.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was it like when you went to the website?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To the point -- as far as I went, it went very well, as did my telephone call I made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How far did you get?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Brianna --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious because I failed to register five times.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t enroll because I have insurance.\xc2\xa0 I would remind --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Fred -- I would remind Brianna and everyone else that the insurance available through the individual options available through the marketplaces as set up by the Affordable Care Act are for those people who do not have insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid. So that\xe2\x80\x99s 15 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s still -- the website still works the same way, whether or not you have it or not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the website doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really know that I have --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Brianna, you get insurance, I trust, through CNN, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not purchasing insurance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the people who --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going through the process because we have a lot of viewers who obviously want to do it, and we want to see sort of what their experience is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you are missing when I tell you that we know there are problems and we are working every day to try to fix them.\xc2\xa0 In the meantime, because our focus is not on debating whether or not there are problems because we\xe2\x80\x99ve already conceded there are, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on fixing those problems and providing information to the American people about how they can either navigate the system or apply on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m missing is if you guys --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99d just let me finish.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- have worked on what the problems are and when they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be resolved.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked that in this colloquy, and I think I answered that earlier, which is that we are addressing the problems every day, and the President won\xe2\x80\x99t be satisfied until the website works effectively.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we\'re making sure that the American people are made aware of the fact that there are a variety of avenues that they can use to find out more about the Affordable Care Act and the options available to them, and to discover the most important fact, which is that they will be able to purchase health insurance, quality health insurance at affordable prices, in many cases for the first time in their lives.</p>\n<p>And I think if you ask those families who have succeeded in doing that already, or who are keenly interested in doing that, that\xe2\x80\x99s what matters to them.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not happy with the fact that a website is not functioning as well as it should, but they\'re interested in getting the insurance.\xc2\xa0 They\'re interested in the product, not the functionality of a website.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think I did say Jackie.\xc2\xa0 I think I called Jackie, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the time when Governor Kasich in Ohio has been working to get his state over his party\'s objection to expand -- to take the Medicaid expansion, has the President reached out to him, had any contacts directly with him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations involving the President with the Governor.\xc2\xa0 I can say generally, as I did in answer to Perry\'s question, that we have, as an administration, engaged with the states on this issue and on, obviously, a lot of matters related to standing up the marketplaces and the various other aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So it certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me if there were conversations with officials in Ohio, including the Governor, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any to report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President have any travel plans in the near term to go out with the theme -- on the theme of the Affordable Care Act?\xc2\xa0 Or has the problems with the website caused him to delay those travel plans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say that the only announced travel we have at this time is Friday, where he\'s going to P-Tech, a school in Brooklyn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Friday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel to announce for next week.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two kind of logistics questions.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, do you expect a two-and-two press conference with the Prime Minister?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make yet about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other is, obviously several times today, and in the past, quite a few times, you\'re referring us to HHS for information.\xc2\xa0 Is it your expectation that they will answer those questions for us?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\'m not trying to be glib, I\'m wondering what your instruction is.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The website that is of considerable focus, understandably, is run by HHS and CMS.\xc2\xa0 They have a team in place that\xe2\x80\x99s working on it.\xc2\xa0 They have brought in individuals as part of this tech surge to help them deal with the problems on the website.\xc2\xa0 So they are the people best situated to answer questions that you have.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to them about what questions they can answer or they\xe2\x80\x99re able to answer.\xc2\xa0 But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important to note is that they are focused on trying to fix these problems.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, too.\xc2\xa0 Take Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question, which seems like basic, right-to-know information -- how much is this costing taxpayers money?\xc2\xa0 As a longtime Washington reporter before you took this job, obviously that would likely be something that you felt was a right to know.\xc2\xa0 Will we get that information from HHS?</p>\n<p>MR CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would address your question to HHS.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information and this is an operation being run by HHS.<br/>\n\tAnd again, all of this information is part of -- I mean, all of this is about the Affordable Care Act, which is a law that was passed and was signed and upheld by the Supreme Court in order to expand and improve insurance coverage for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, should they provide that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer you to HHS about what information they have and what they\xe2\x80\x99re able to provide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Got to go.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:52 P.M.
