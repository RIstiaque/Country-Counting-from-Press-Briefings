EDT</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- a number of the decisions that the President will highlight today at both stops in Michigan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First, well, as you guys know and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about over the past couple of days, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to visit a Chrysler plant that has -- that is adding a new shift, 1,100 workers, and next go to a GM facility that is producing the new Chevy Volt.</p>\n<p>Just to sort of recap a little bit from yesterday, this is the first time the Big Three have reported -- all three have reported an operating profit in the same quarter -- happened this year, so for the first time since 2004.</p>\n<p>The auto industry the year before the President came into office lost more than 300,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 Since GM reemerged from bankruptcy, the auto industry has added 55,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 So -- and that\'s the first time that the auto industry has been adding jobs in -- since 1999, so more than a decade.\xc2\xa0 So the President is going to go today to highlight this story, to talk about the decisions that he made, talk about the tough sacrifices that workers and management had to make and highlight the beginnings of what we hope will be a long-term, good news story.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the Commerce report, kind of disappointing about the recovery?\xc2\xa0 And do we need more stimulus?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the statistics today confirm what a lot of people in Michigan that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk to today and a lot of people around the country knew, and that is the new statistics and the revisions for 2007, 2008 and 2009 demonstrate that this is the longest and deepest recession on record in our history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We lost more than 8 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we know times have been tough.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have seen over the course of this year so far steady job -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry steady economic growth at about 3 percent, but we all know we have to do more, and we have to do better.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d say the first thing that needs to happen to address the statistics today is for the Republicans in the U.S. Senate to stop playing politics with what ought to be a pretty easy thing, and that is cutting capital gains taxes for small business, allowing small businesses to deduct more from their taxes when they invest in new equipment, and to provide community banks with the capital that small businesses need to get quickly.</p>\n<p>That\'s the best response -- short-term response we could have to these numbers is for the Republican Party that preaches it virtually -- virtually every time somebody puts a tape recorder in their face about how much they want to help small business, now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to walk the walk, not just talk the talk.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the administration change any of its policies based on the second quarter report?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look through the statistics.\xc2\xa0 I think they largely demonstrate what we already knew that we have -- it took us eight years to get into this economic mess, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take us more than a year and a half to get out of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s what Brian and the economic team will continue to focus on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried, though, that the economy is losing steam?\xc2\xa0 The recovery that seemed to be fairly solid early in the year is losing steam and faltering?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Karen, there is no doubt that we have hit headwinds.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly talked about this -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about it -- that what happened in Europe, what happened in Greece in the late spring was a big part of that headwind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States made some tough decisions to stabilize our financial system and to inject some recovery into their economy.\xc2\xa0 And Europe didn\'t do, quite frankly, as much.\xc2\xa0 And that has no doubt stunted our growth and stunted world growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there consideration of another stimulus now?\xc2\xa0 Or not at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think if you look at the politics of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on on Capitol Hill right now, I think we got everything we could.\xc2\xa0 But I will say again, Margaret, that cutting capital gains taxes on small business, I doubt many of us thought we\xe2\x80\x99d live long enough to watch Republicans stop cutting capital gains taxes on small business.</p>\n<p>I mean this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a partisan issue, and if it was a partisan issue yesterday, I hope that that caucus will take a look at the statistics that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today, reacquaint themselves with the 8 million people that have lost jobs -- understand this, they like to say that -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s true that small -- small business is the job creation engine of our economy -- and hopefully do some thinking over the weekend to put aside some of their partisan and ideological bents to help the American people make some progress in this economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the President is going to spotlight the jobs -- the new hiring among some of these plants, but the fact of the matter is, is that tens of thousands of jobs that were lost over years during the downturn to the auto industry will never come back, so what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to those people who will never be able to be back on the assembly line?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the history.\xc2\xa0 The decision the President made -- and Brian was in those meetings; I was in a lot of those meetings -- was a decision to save a million jobs.\xc2\xa0 And you hear a lot of people talk about the decisions they would have made.\xc2\xa0 They would have walked away from a million people.\xc2\xa0 They would away from the communities.\xc2\xa0 They would have walked away from the livelihoods that many enjoyed.</p>\n<p>So first and foremost, we\xe2\x80\x99re glad that those million jobs have been saved.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an easy decision, but it was the right one.\xc2\xa0 Now, the auto industry is adding jobs.\xc2\xa0 I do think that the auto industry can continue to create jobs because clearly they\'re making products that have and enjoy increasing consumer demand.\xc2\xa0 And understand this, we are seeing profitability and job creation in an economy of about 11 or 11.5 million in annual sales, down from probably a high of about 17 or 17.4 million.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the auto industry has done well in a fragile economy.\xc2\xa0 As the recovery continues, we expect that consumer demand will increase and we can bring back some of those jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at OMB?</p>\n<p>MR. DEESE:\xc2\xa0 The only thing I would add to that is that -- and some of this will be on display during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip today, which is in addition to the steps that the administration took with respect to GM and Chrysler, the administration has also taken a set of -- made a set of investments and made a set of decisions to try to help build a long term, new industry in the United States that\xe2\x80\x99s not just about building the cars of the future, but making sure that the technologies of the future are designed here and made here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so you saw the President visit a battery manufacturer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re expecting that there were two battery plants in the United States before the President took office, we\xe2\x80\x99re now projected to have 30 of those in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that means jobs, but it also means the foundation of a new industry that\xe2\x80\x99s more innovative and where we\xe2\x80\x99re building things here in the United States that people just a couple of years ago never expected we would be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at OMB, that Jeffrey Zients is going to be taking over as acting director and Rob Nabors is going to be coming over before Lew is -- you can confirm both those things?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President signaled and picked Jack Lew to succeed Peter Orszag, who leaves today.\xc2\xa0 And the President appreciates Peter\xe2\x80\x99s service.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Peter was involved in helping to craft the Recovery Act, was a key player in particularly the cost-cutting measures in health care, all valuable and important contributions to this administration, work that we\xe2\x80\x99re all proud of.</p>\n<p>I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good team in place -- an acting team, Rob coming back after spending some time in the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s Office -- as we send Jack Lew\xe2\x80\x99s nomination up, and hopefully the Senate will act on it quicker than they normally do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline for the head of the Consumer Protection Agency?\xc2\xa0 Any update on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing.\xc2\xa0 No updates and no imminent announcements.\xc2\xa0 I would add one thing on health care.\xc2\xa0 Today, the Medicare agency is releasing some new ads featuring Andy Griffith that highlight some of the impacts of the Affordable Care Act on Medicare, including reduced prescription drug prices, increases in fighting fraud against seniors, and free checkups, which are all important aspects of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a piece today in the New York Times opinion section called \xe2\x80\x9cGM\xe2\x80\x99s Electric Lemon.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the President has read that this morning and whether he is concerned about it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President -- Deese had a good point that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him make now.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t do a lot of fact checking, I would say, on some of these things.</p>\n<p>MR. DEESE:\xc2\xa0 I would just say two things.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President has been clear, and I think we were clear about this, as well, that the decisions that this company, its independent board and its management are making are their decisions.\xc2\xa0 And so I think some of the suggestions in those pieces that somehow we were involved in or even made aware of decisions around that vehicle or any of the other day-to-day business decisions are just wrong.</p>\n<p>But I would also point out there was a sort of interesting theory in that piece that somehow the management or the administration, but even the management would want to push up the price of this vehicle to help sort of boost its revenues in advance of an IPO.\xc2\xa0 But the company has been clear.\xc2\xa0 The company is not even going to take purchases of this vehicle until after the period in which they have indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in doing the IPO.</p>\n<p>So there was some sort of logical inconsistencies in the piece that I think we looked at.\xc2\xa0 But I think more generally, this is an independent company and they\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions about how to market their products.\xc2\xa0 And we have been -- we have taken a very explicit hands-off posture over the last year since they exited bankruptcy precisely because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be involved in this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did you guys ever see \xe2\x80\x9cAnimal House?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Remember when they go, \xe2\x80\x9cNeidermeyer dead?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say his argument is largely there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your estimate of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neidermeyer, dead man.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let the transcript reflect that Mr. Babington was trying to convince people that he had not seen \xe2\x80\x9cAnimal House,\xe2\x80\x9d but then goes through the line rather convincingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your estimate about how much the government will be able to recoup from the initial Bush administration investment?\xc2\xa0 Do you have one?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously our hope is -- we think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get back the $60 billion that the Obama administration invested.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, our strong hope is to get all of that money back to ensure that the taxpayers aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the hook.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward a crisis responsibility fee, a financial crisis responsibility fee that ensures that taxpayers are made whole.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that that initial investment is lost, the Bush administration investment is lost?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much of that the companies themselves, you get back from the companies.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that those were -- that was money that was given without the requirement to do anything.\xc2\xa0 That was one of the criticisms of that -- of those actions then, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President demanded that the companies that -- those that work there, that everyone involved make sacrifices.\xc2\xa0 And we put both of these companies on a sure footing, business-wise.\xc2\xa0 They clearly have taken some of those actions and have changed their economic outlook.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say anything edgier about Charlie Rangel than you were willing to yesterday before we go?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to add.\xc2\xa0 I like that, though, edgier.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. DEESE:\xc2\xa0 The only other point on that I would say is, look, nobody can predict the future.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the trend in the projections of the return to taxpayers from this investment, it has been consistently improving.\xc2\xa0 And so at the current moment, the Treasury Department projection is for about $60 billion to return.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the trend, I think it has been consistently positive.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:03 A.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
