Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">2:15 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Let me take 10 seconds to get organized.\xc2\xa0 Let me quickly go through a week ahead for your planning.<br/> <br/>  The President will spend the weekend in Washington and has no scheduled public events.\xc2\xa0 On Monday the President will sign the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act in the Rose Garden.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday the President will meet with the President of Chile at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday the President will hold a town hall meeting here at the White House in the East Room on health care, which will be broadcast on ABC during prime time.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday the President --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what time?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\'s taped at 8:00 p.m. and broadcast at 10:00 p.m., if I\'m not mistaken.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coverage?\xc2\xa0 Are the rest of the press in there as well?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume so.\xc2\xa0 I assume we\'ll put a pool in there at least.<br/> <br/>  On Thursday the President will participate in a service event in Washington.\xc2\xa0 The President will also host a small group of Senate and House members from both sides of the aisle at the White House for an immigration meeting.\xc2\xa0 The meeting is to continue the conversation with the hopes of beginning the debate in earnest later this year.\xc2\xa0 In the evening the President will host a picnic for members of Congress and their families on the South Lawn.\xc2\xa0 And next Friday the President will meet with German Chancellor Merkel here at the White House.<br/> <br/>  Ms. Loven.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House resolution, it asks for a direct condemnation of the government in Iran\'s use of violence against protestors.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of direct condemnation has not come from the White House this week.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the resolution?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we welcome the resolution and we believe despite the question that it echoes the words of President Obama throughout the week.\xc2\xa0 I think he --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve been saying that you hope they don\'t use violence and directly -- it may be a small difference, but it\'s a big difference to some people.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was pretty clear on Monday in the avail with Berlusconi.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he was troubled by violence.\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t say they shouldn\'t do it or directly criticize them for doing it.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the way I read it.\xc2\xa0 I think when the --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have the --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have the same transcript right here.\xc2\xa0 I think when the President sits in the Oval Office and says he\'s:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 deeply troubled by what I\'ve seen on television, and the American people are rightly troubled by that; I think when the President discusses as he did with President Lee that something has happened in Iran, where there\'s a questioning of the kinds of antagonistic postures toward the international community that have taken place in the past, and there are people who want to see greater openness, greater debate, and want to see greater democracy -- I stand strongly with the universal principle that people\'s voices should be heard and not be suppressed.<br/> <br/>  I think the language in the resolution is very consistent with the language that the President has used.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It makes direct criticism of the government, which he has not done.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can quibble on this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been clear in standing up for the universal principles and deploring violence.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So comment on the resolution?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, we welcome it.\xc2\xa0 It\'s consistent with what the President has said.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, continuing on that theme, what is the White House and the President\'s reaction to the supreme leader of Iran warning to protestors to stop protesting and calling on -- saying that leaders will be held responsible for bloodshed?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President addressed that also on Monday, that he believes, as we have said throughout the week and as I\'ve said throughout the week, those who wish to have their voices heard should be able to do that -- to do that without fear of violence; that that is an important universal principle that should be upheld.\xc2\xa0 And I think he strongly supports that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would he criticize or condemn this particular statement from the supreme leader?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been clear on what he believes:\xc2\xa0 that he believes strongly that people should have their voices heard, that clearly there is, as he said on Tuesday, a ferment in Iran that is bringing about change.<br/> <br/>  I will say, as the President has said, we\'re not going to be used as political foils and political footballs in a debate that\'s happening by Iranians in Iran.\xc2\xa0 There are many people in the leadership that would love us to get involved.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The leadership of Iran?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And would love to trot out the same old foils they have for many years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not what we\'re going to do.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you one non-Iran question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction to the indictment of Allen Stanford?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would certainly -- I obviously would point you for details to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 But I think whether it\'s this indictment or previous indictments that we have seen over the course of many months -- I know we\'ve talked specifically about Mr. Madoff -- there are those whose outsized greed robbed millions of people of their savings and created part of a culture that led us to parts of the economic disaster that we\'ve seen in this country.<br/> <br/>  I think the President has tried to address some of that in different proposals as well as financial regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that those that have lost their savings will see justice.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this year the special inspector general for TARP, Neil Barofsky, tried to get documents relating to AIG.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department rebuffed that request, although ultimately I think they did turn over the documents -- but the Treasury Department sought a ruling from the Justice Department on just how independent Neil Barofsky\'s office is supposed to be.\xc2\xa0 Please explain from the administration\'s perspective what exactly is going on here and why it appears as though the Treasury Department is pushing back against an independent inspector general.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Jake, the President believes that inspectors general fulfill a unique and important role in ensuring that programs operate with efficiency.\xc2\xa0 No attorney-client privilege on any of this stuff has been invoked.\xc2\xa0 No documents sought have been or are being withheld.\xc2\xa0 The DOJ review is not related to any particular investigation.\xc2\xa0 It is sorting out the legal issues relating to the creation of the office.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but could you explain -- could you actually answer my question?\xc2\xa0 I understand the talking points you\'ve been given, but can you answer my question, which is, why would the Treasury Department push back against the inspector general trying to get the documents --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand the --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to DOJ on the specifics on the specifics of that, and point you to the fact that the documents haven\'t been withheld.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Robert, we\'re only, what, 150-some days into this --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A hundred and fifty one.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A hundred and fifty one days into this presidency.\xc2\xa0 Already the President has fired one inspector general, and his Treasury Department is challenging the independence of a different inspector general.\xc2\xa0 Can you understand why people who believed the President when he talked about the desire to be held accountable and the need for transparency would say --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, we outlined the reasons why the inspector general for the Corporation of National Service, acted upon by the bipartisan board, recommended that he not be retained.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve discussed that.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve discussed that with the staff in many ways, and there are issues that are being sorted out in terms of the creation of different offices, but no documents are being withheld.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but why did the Treasury Department push back?\xc2\xa0 I understand ultimately they gave the documents, but why did they not --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything from Treasury.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly look and see what legal issues they were concerned about.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the precedent that -- do you believe, does the President believe that the inspector general should be able to get whatever documents he needs to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The inspector general has gotten those documents.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With a struggle.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I don\'t know how -- more to say that the inspector -- the answer to your question is the inspector general has the documents that the inspector general wanted.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, either the Treasury Department respects the office of this inspector general or it doesn\'t.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, we can go back and forth on your question and my answer.\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve answered the question.<br/> <br/>  Helen.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to drop the public option in lieu of the opposition on the conservatives on the Hill --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- including the Democrats?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to fight for it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President believes strongly that for the uninsured entering the market there has to be choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 The American people, coincidently, believe that too.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\'s an important aspect of any health care reform plan that has to go through Congress.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in light of the Ayatollah\'s comments and just the overall climate in Iran, is it more difficult now for the administration to have any kind of significant dialogue with Iran over the nuclear issue?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President and the team don\'t believe so.\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, we\'ve talked about this, our interests remain the same.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned about the Islamic Republic living up to its responsibilities as it relates to nuclear weapons.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they\'re saying -- the Ayatollah is saying, you know, the U.S. is giving mixed messages or the President, specifically -- I mean, how will that complicate the dialogue?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think anybody should be under the illusion that any of this will be easy, but our interests remain the same, I think the interests of the world remain the same.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, we have a pretty good sense of what not engaging with Iran, what the results of that are, in the number of several thousand spinning centrifuges.\xc2\xa0 The President discussed the notion that we have to do things differently and I think you see, as we\'ve said, we\'ve seen at least the ferment, as the President said, of productive change in Iran.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if -- you know, the fact that the President has said he doesn\'t want to meddle in the election there, is it not possible to have very strong language in support of the Iranian people without meddling?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, it is -- the President did it on Monday and Tuesday.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some would believe that it\'s not strong enough.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know there are some Republicans that didn\'t believe it was strong enough.\xc2\xa0 There are some Republicans that did believe it was strong enough.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it possible for him to have stronger language without taking sides?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President feels comfortable with the strong language that he employed on Monday and Tuesday to discuss this very situation.\xc2\xa0 But, Dan, let me repeat again, there are people in Iran that would love for us to get involved.\xc2\xa0 There are people in Iran who would love not to make it about one side in Iran versus another, but to make this about Iran versus the West or Iran versus the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 It worked great for years.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think many others, Democrat and Republican, have discussed the wisdom in that stance and the President is quite comfortable with where he is.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow, Robert?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as Iran is concerned, President has been reaching to everyone in that part of the world, including his speech in Turkey, his speech in Cairo, and here a very clear message as far as democracy and changes in those part of the world was concerned.\xc2\xa0 You think President\'s voices are being heard and his message, because what he was expecting that we care for you, but you (inaudible), we will work with you and changes must come in that part of the world just like in the U.S. or elsewhere.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the actions that the administration has taken and the voice of this President in reaching out, whether it was interviews early in the administration, messages to the people, directly to the people of Iran, the speech in Cairo -- I do think that people have heard the President\'s message.\xc2\xa0 The President understands that five months of activity or an interview, a message and a speech aren\'t going to change everything overnight.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President feels confident that we\'re making progress in that region of the world.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, please?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go with Chip.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe I missed this and maybe it\'s redundant, but I just want to get it clarified.\xc2\xa0 Does the President condemn the actions of the Iranian government?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has condemned the violence.\xc2\xa0 He\'s condemned --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he condemn the actions of the Ayatollah --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the violence is being conducted by the government, right?\xc2\xa0 The Revolutionary Guard -- the pictures that we saw on Monday that the President reacted to, that was them.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\'s clearly condemning the government of Iran?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at what he said throughout the week, it\'s clear.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, some dire reports out there -- I\'m sure they\'re much more dire than you think they ought to be -- but there have been delays up there.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of Democrats who say that the price tag now is just eye-popping, especially in light of the CBO analysis.\xc2\xa0 And there are -- and Republicans feel they\'re getting tremendous traction here on the cost issue and that the tide is turning in their favor.\xc2\xa0 Is this coming off the rails to any degree?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\'m reminded that in five short months of the administration, about every six weeks I\'m asked if the current initiative is heading off the rails; if something has unwound.\xc2\xa0 We did it with the recovery plan, we did it with our budget, we did it with the recent supplemental --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is much bigger and more difficult than any of those.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would love to have posited that in response to one of your questions in, say, early January, mid-March, or just a few weeks ago in the supplemental.\xc2\xa0 Look, Chip, there is a legislative process that takes time to wind its way through.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What inning are we in?\xc2\xa0 What inning are we in on health care?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Early, right?\xc2\xa0 Maybe second?\xc2\xa0 You still got plenty of time to get a beer and a hot dog before last call.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have hot dogs.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to say maybe a better alternative than a hot dog.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to get a hot dog.<br/> <br/>  But look, I think we had an introduction of a bill in the House today -- or a release of a piece of legislation in the House today that upholds the President\'s goal of cutting costs, increasing the quality of health care in America, broadening accessibility.\xc2\xa0 The health committee that Senator Dodd is leading right now is marking up a bill and making progress.\xc2\xa0 I think we continue to put one foot in front of the other in the march toward health care reform.<br/> <br/>  But as I\'ve said before, there\'s a reason this is an issue that\'s been debated back and forth for 40 years.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think some of the most important things that came out of CBO this week were underscoring -- I know this doesn\'t get a lot of news attention because there\'s no conflict -- but underscoring the notion that the President has outlined a series of steps that CBO believes must be taken in order to deal with the rising costs of health care as it relates to the government\'s budget.<br/> <br/>  We think those are all positive developments and we have -- I think if you look back at some of the efforts that have been done over the past few decades, we have stakeholders that are involved in this that are on occasion split up and on different sides and shooting back and forth at each other that are all at the table working on this.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t call it a game in the second inning.<br/> <br/>  Chuck.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on the Iran stuff.\xc2\xa0 You said nothing would change -- you know, sort of, nothing is going to change sort of what the President wants to do in a policy toward Iran and having to do with the nuclear situation.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe there should be consequences, though, in any future dialogue that is started, or whatever, based on the actions that the Iranian government has taken in this time period?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of any of the dialogue.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been clear in underscoring and deploring the violence.\xc2\xa0 But as I\'ve said, Chuck, we still have U.S. interests on many issues including the one on nuclear weapons.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what message does that send?\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the things that you guys --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The message that it sends is we\'re very clear about dealing with their nuclear weapons.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if it means dealing with a regime that you think may have stolen an election, may have started violence, may have pushed back -- set back freedom, potential for freedom?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is about -- well, I think the President and the international community understand the importance of dealing with what they all believe is the danger of Iran possessing a nuclear weapon.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to look to the United Nations for some international capacity to sort of condemn -- if there is -- because of this violence that you now say that we should -- that you guys have condemned the Iranian government -- should there be some sort of U.N. action that maybe does this?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to anybody on our team at the U.N.\xc2\xa0 I think what you see -- I think you see the size of marches increase.\xc2\xa0 I think you see the passion increase.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know of any steps that are happening at the U.N.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on immigration.\xc2\xa0 He said something today in his speech at the National Hispanic Prayer Breakfast, that he wanted to seek comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 In his hundred-day press conference he talked about -- he seemed to step back from that.\xc2\xa0 So what\'s changed since -- before he said, "We want to enforce some laws on the books, then we\'ll start looking at trying to do some more."<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, has something changed since the hundred-day --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the meeting next week will continue this process.\xc2\xa0 But as we\'ve said before, Chuck, we know there\'s -- we know the votes aren\'t there right now.\xc2\xa0 This is a --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what\'s dictating the timetable.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll point you ad nauseum to any number of the questions on health care that might -- I mean, yes, if we can\'t seek 50 plus one, it will be tough to pass.<br/> <br/>  No, I mean, to be more serious, I think there\'s a seriousness in an effort, but in understanding that in -- I think in 2005 and 2006, even in 2007, there was not a majority yet to do this.\xc2\xa0 We want to work with those, both in favor and support of those previous efforts, to see where we can get comprehensive immigration reform to pass.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on health care for a moment.\xc2\xa0 The Senate Finance Committee is trying to bring the total costs of the bill down to a trillion dollars or less, and I understand the White House supports that goal, as well.\xc2\xa0 Are you willing to make the tradeoffs that would be needed specifically in order to bring the costs down?\xc2\xa0 Forget about the pay-for, but just to bring the actual costs down you\'re going to have to turn back the benefit package, turn back the number of people who qualify for subsidies, the size of the subsidies; that\'s how you bring the costs down.\xc2\xa0 Is that a tradeoff that you\'re willing to make?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we continue to watch what\'s going on as the finance committee works through this process.\xc2\xa0 I would mention that the President has put, I think at last count, $950 billion on the table as -- you\'re shaking your head -- it\'s actually --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but that\'s not really relevant to my question.\xc2\xa0 My question is, how do you pay for it; my question is, how much do you need to pay for?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but you did talk about pay-fors, right?\xc2\xa0 And if we\'re going to talk about -- if you\'re going to talk about trimming the cost down to a trillion, then I\'m going to tell you that $950 billion has been put on the table.\xc2\xa0 I actually think $950 billion of a trillion is actually a relevant part of the conversation to have.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\'s a relevant part of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 He\'s talked about the fact that this plan has to be deficit-neutral.\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways that\'s a good portion of the answer.<br/> <br/>  The President isn\'t going to sign a health care bill -- I know you\'re shaking your head, let me just try to finish this.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to sign a health care bill that increases the size of the deficit.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the budget resolution won\'t allow him to do that, right?\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/> <br/>  So $950 billion is indeed relevant because having a series and an amount of money in order to pay for that bill equaling the cost of that bill will be part of what has to happen in order to get that through the process.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I probably didn\'t ask the question clearly enough.\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to ask was not how are you going to pay for it, are you serious about paying for it.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve spoken to that extensively.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m saying is in order to bring --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hoping, persuasive -- but yes, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was pressing my luck.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I said I don\'t disagree --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I put $950 billion on persuasive.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t disagree that you have put $950 billion of offsets on the table.\xc2\xa0 My question is, in order to get the price of the bill down to $1 trillion from an estimated, what the last finance markup was, over $1.6 trillion -- in order to bring that cost down, there are consequences which are reducing the benefit package, reducing the subsidies.\xc2\xa0 And I want to know whether those are tradeoffs that the White House is willing to make.<br/> <br/>  (Cell phone rings.)<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 We are -- whose phone is that?\xc2\xa0 All right, I\'m kind of itchy here on Friday, I would love to take somebody\'s phone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Obviously this whole process is going to be about how do we get something that is paid for and gets through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has discussed this throughout the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know what the structure, in all honesty, of what is contained in the finance committee\'s markup package of what -- all the details of what that benefit looks like, the degree to which it goes out in terms of incidence of -- percentage of your income above some percentage of poverty.<br/> <br/>  But there\'s no doubt that these are exactly the types of tradeoffs and decisions that are going to have to be made throughout this process in order to get something -- whether it\'s -- regardless of what that ultimate number is -- and, again, the President has been very forceful in saying that that number has to be paid for, and that in looking for those resources we have to take the steps necessary, as we talked about a little earlier ago, to bend the curve on the government\'s cost of health care in the future; that if we\'re not taking those steps, then we\'re not getting health care reform.<br/> <br/>  So all of those things are what I think will be -- will take up Congress\'s time and the President\'s time in the next few weeks.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On tobacco and this legislation he\'s going to sign on Monday, to what extent can we expect him to fold his own experience into what he\'s going to say, his own experience with smoking?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I anticipate he\'ll have -- he\'ll mention that in the remarks.\xc2\xa0 You know, as we talked about last week when the President discussed his pleasure in seeing a bill that has wound its way through a legislative process for more than a decade to land on the President\'s desk for his signature -- he understands the struggles of millions of Americans with tobacco.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the President sign the war supplemental?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer on -- I don\'t know that we\'ve received the legislation yet, but it will be -- I don\'t anticipate that it will take long after we receive it.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, Republican Leader John Boehner said today that the U.S. should lead an international embargo on gasoline sales to Iran as a way to encourage the government not to use violence against protestors.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that\'s a good idea, or are there other concrete steps the U.S. could take to --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see those comments before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 We can have somebody look into that.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions is something we\'ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 The President authored a bill that I can get you the details on, that as I recall was blocked last year by a Republican to put some stronger sanctions on Iran, and we\'ll get you some information on that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think that sanctions now are an appropriate response to the way the Iranian government is behaving towards protestors?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, I think the President -- well, I don\'t want to get into the tit-for-tat on that right now.<br/> <br/>  Major.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that quickly, when you said, "Sanctions are something we\'ve discussed," you mean generally -- not in the context of this crisis?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just wanted to clarify that.<br/> <br/>  All right, I\'ve got three topics, but one question on each, I promise.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Hey, don\'t tell me. (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe the Congressional Budget Office is an effective and reliable arbiter of the scoring of health care proposals and does it have any --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To you it certainly does.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- sort of say about the House Speaker and Chris Dodd, who were significant players in this debate, both in the last 48 hours criticized CBO\'s methodology and the scoring that has come up --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, but remember -- and I haven\'t seen the exact comments, but remember that -- and I think even --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said she\'s frustrated because the CBO, in her words, always comes up with a "worst case scenario."\xc2\xa0 And Dodd has said he\'s never understood why we have to please the CBO instead of ourselves as legislators.\xc2\xa0 Is there -- and I just wondered if the White House is satisfied with that kind of commentary.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe some of that frustration is the fact that right now CBO is looking at older proposals or half measures.\xc2\xa0 I think the Dodd legislation that originally was scored wasn\'t a final product.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there were savings mechanisms in there about bending the cost of health care.<br/> <br/>  But look, the President, as I said pretty clearly today, the President is going to look for health care reform that\'s fully paid for.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the measurement of the Congressional Budget Office.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Unless or until somebody comes up with something different, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, under the sanctions, any member nation that wishes to enforce either the tracking of a suspect vessel or its inspection or shepherding that vessel to port must obtain the permission from its own government at the political and military level.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the language within 1874.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been asked for permission for the U.S. Navy to board --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is there anything about the cargo on this vessel that leads you to believe that request is likely to come?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get into that sort of specificity.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last topic.\xc2\xa0 The prayer breakfast today reminded me of something the President said during the campaign, that he would hope to or he probably would have a church selected for his and the girls\' and Michelle\'s attendance in January.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now in June -- can you update us on either the President\'s churchgoing habits or his process in selecting a church?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know they\'re continuing to look for a permanent place, mindful of many things.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Such as?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What it does when a President decides to walk out of this building and walk into a different building and disrupt worshippers that are attending for their own personal reasons.\xc2\xa0 I think that is certainly -- that\'s not an exhaustive list, but certainly one of the things that the President has on his mind about that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else that he has on his mind about it?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think there\'s wanting to ensure that he finds a church that he, Michelle, and the girls feel most comfortable in.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, following on that --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he use the chapel in Camp David?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He does.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow on church?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President, since he has not found a church home here in Washington yet, is he -- is a minister being brought in to the White House on Sundays to have a service with the family?\xc2\xa0 And is that also happening at Camp David?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\'ve just said to Major, the President has been and very much enjoys the chapel and the chaplain up at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that anybody has been brought in here.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also real fast on something, the Senate has unanimously passed a symbolic resolution apologizing for slavery and racial segregation, and sent the measure to the House.\xc2\xa0 This being the first black President -- Bill Clinton did not apologize for slavery; George W. Bush said he would not do it as Africans were also involved in the slave trade.\xc2\xa0 Does this President think that that\'s something that should indeed happen?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not spoken with him specifically about the Senate resolution and I\'d want to get his view on that.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, what is the President\'s thought about slavery, especially since he invoked --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Opposed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Opposed.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Especially since --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, you just asked me what the President\'s view on slavery was.\xc2\xa0 What did you think I was going to say?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t let me finish my --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, look, this is a very serious topic --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- I just want to note that that was your question.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but I want to finish the statement --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And it does drive me crazy when one doesn\'t get a chance to finish their entire statement before somebody else -- I\'m sorry, I\'m off track, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It is Friday, guys; I\'m just trying to have a little fun.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway, you know, especially dealing with this issue of slavery, especially since he invoked the issue of slavery over a year ago in his Philadelphia speech on race, is it something that this White House could indeed tackle?\xc2\xa0 Bill Clinton tackled it and tabled it in his second term when he dealt with the race initiative.\xc2\xa0 Is this something --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tackled and tabled what?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The apology -- the possibility of an apology for slavery.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, one, I don\'t know if this is even something that -- just purely legislatively, I don\'t know if the resolution per se ultimately comes here or not for signature.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.<br/> <br/>  Look, I think the President has spoken on any number of occasions about the stain that slavery left on this country, that throughout our history we have sought to better perfect our union and have had many bumps along the way.\xc2\xa0 And one of the most significant of those stains is that of slavery; that it is clearly something that we continue to struggle with.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously hopes that we can make progress on race relations and that we all have a deeper and better understanding of backgrounds and beliefs.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard senior administration officials say that what\'s happening in Iran is not about us.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve also heard them say that they\'ve never seen anything like this in Iran before.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that the President\'s outreach to the Muslim world, in Cairo or to Iran specifically in the New Year\'s greeting, is influencing events in Iran right now?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I wouldn\'t in any way seek for the administration to take the credit for what we\'re seeing in Iran.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that -- as you said, I\'m not sure that anybody, even a week ago or so would have expected to see the courageous images that we\'re seeing now.<br/> <br/>  I will say that I think that there are those in Iran and those throughout the Middle East that have noticed a different way of operating by this country, and that they\'ve seen -- and I think we\'ve seen some improved relations, and I think we\'ve also seen some improvement in the way this country is thought of by many countries in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s tremendously important not because we all have to feel better, but because there are very important foreign policy and strategic interests that we\'ve discussed a lot in that region of the world.<br/> <br/>  I do think that I think you are seeing in Iran -- I think you\'re definitely witnessing something extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re witnessing something that many people might not have presumed or imagined, like I said, just a few -- even a few weeks or a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 And I think part of that is sort of what we discussed earlier, and that is I think there are those in Iran that see the United States of America not as it has been described to them, not as those have wanted their people to believe.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a positive development for this country and for the entire world.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any idea how the Cairo speech was consumed in Iran?\xc2\xa0 In other words, was it shown on --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can have those guys pull and see if we have stuff in terms of some of the social networking sites, or what media it might have been shown in --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Farsi one of the SMS --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 So let me see if we can get you some stats on that.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just briefly, back on health care and the struggles of trying to figure out how to pay for what it is that is ultimately agreed on.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s been some talk, at least among some of the Democrats, of additional taxes, various things that -- and also the discussion of taxing the employer benefits.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans, it probably won\'t surprise you to hear, are accusing Democrats of preparing a tax fest to pay for the President\'s plan, which is not affordable.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to that?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, Mark, I think if you -- if I\'m not mistaken, I can think of at least one Republican off the top of my head that talked about changing the tax benefits for the exclusion.\xc2\xa0 I think if I sat at Google for about five minutes I could probably get you several dozen.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the major reform bills that\'s up there right now that\'s been written by Senator Burr includes, if not a complete ending of the exclusion, some cap of it.\xc2\xa0 So maybe they --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The RNC is specifically suggesting that some of these taxes are going to break the President\'s pledge of not taxing the middle class.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was pretty clear on that in an interview earlier this week relating to financial regulation.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes, as he said in that interview, that he\'s put forward a course of action that he thinks is best able at this point to put that skin in the game.\xc2\xa0 The bulk of that is changing the way we pay for health care.\xc2\xa0 It\'s injecting -- it\'s taking subsidies out of -- for Medicare middle men, and it\'s going back to the charitable deduction rates of the Reagan era.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are -- the President feels confident about what he\'s put on the table.<br/> <br/>  Let me just go back to it -- I think I read this earlier, but wondered what the President said earlier this week:\xc2\xa0 "I do believe that something has happened in Iran where there\'s a questioning of the kinds of antagonistic postures toward the international community that have taken place in the past and that there are people who want to see greater openness, greater debate, and want to see a greater democracy."<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. reached out to any other countries, as far as helping in tracking that wayward freighter out there that -- and is the U.S. looking at options beyond the U.N. resolution or possibly boarding it one day?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get into operational specificity.\xc2\xa0 As Ambassador Rice said here just one week ago, we sought from the United Nations and the international community strict sanctions on the movement of -- possible movement of this type of material, and we\'re fully committed to implementing what\'s in those resolutions right now and changing, hopefully, the course of some behavior.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what kind of outreach was there to the House in shaping the Iran resolution?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume some people talked -- were in conversations, but I don\'t know to what degree.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But definitely --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume that --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somebody in the White House --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume so, yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on immigration.\xc2\xa0 What the President talked about this morning sounded similar to what was discussed in the summer of \'07.\xc2\xa0 You said the votes aren\'t there for it now.\xc2\xa0 How do you get --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you get there through the continuation of this dialogue and see if you can come up with ultimately -- I mean, obviously, look, if you put up just what was out there we\'re going to have to look through that and other ideas.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President looks forward to -- keep in mind that there will be people at the White House next week that don\'t agree with where the President and others are.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be final invitations having gone out.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be members from both sides of the aisle next week to discuss it.<br/> <br/>  Yes.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s The Wall Street Journal report that President Obama wants to include civil unions to be counted in the census.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President wants?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, obviously, as we\'ve discussed, the President and the administration are committed to a fair and accurate count of all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And as the piece said, we\'re in the midst of determining the best way to ensure that gay and lesbian couples are accurately counted.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on John Berry\'s call that we had the other day when the President signed the memorandum, he talked about the need for a specific number of votes to fulfill the President\'s campaign promise of repealing "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" and the Defense of Marriage Act, and he kept saying 60 votes in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But is the White House talking to Republicans that might favor the repeal of this?\xc2\xa0 I know there are a few.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, look, I think the administration -- well, obviously, for math purposes, we\'re going to have to have a coalition of people that believe, on each of those interests, that the policy isn\'t serving our nation well.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to making progress on both of those issues.<br/> <br/>  Steve.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the question of this apology for slavery.\xc2\xa0 The Senate resolution also includes a disclaimer of sorts.\xc2\xa0 It said, "This should never be used to argue for reparations."\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Black Caucus is very unhappy about that; it may not win their support when it goes back to the House.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think reparations should be ruled out?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President has not and does not favor reparations.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 In the spirit of the discussion on Iran, have the Russians shared with you the results of their own discussion with the Iranian leader who they hosted recently in their own country?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, whether NSC had discussed --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I really wanted to ask you about the upcoming trip to Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I know it\'s probably too early, but can you talk in general about how the President gets ready for such trips, how early he starts, what the preparations involve?\xc2\xa0 Is there any input from the outside -- outside of the White House?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the process in many ways for this upcoming and important trip to Moscow started not long after, and in some cases working on specific initiatives, before the G20 in late March.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have a robust agenda with which we hope to discuss, particularly surrounding making -- restarting arms control talks.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, by the end of the year coming to an agreement about some specific numbers to eliminate nuclear -- begin to take some steps to eliminate even further nuclear weapons that each side has toward the President\'s goal ultimately of a nuclear-free world.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen comments in the press suggesting that it\'s still a different type of a visit, going to Moscow, than going to Europe, for instance, or even going to the Arab world as he has done recently.\xc2\xa0 Is it really for you?\xc2\xa0 Is it any different in terms of preparations, in terms of --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, I think everybody understands the importance of the issues that are going to be discussed.\xc2\xa0 I think in many ways the preparation -- the preparation is not that much different.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that we can make some substantive progress on issues that we know are of importance to both sides.<br/> <br/>  David.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, when did --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe we have to move you up to the first row, if you keep asking more questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did they last talk, the two Presidents?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that they\'ve spoken since the G20.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know, obviously, General Jones has spoken with his counterpart; Mike McFaul has had many discussions.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t believe the two Presidents have spoken since that date.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past week, has the President spoken to any outside-the-government experts on Iran?\xc2\xa0 And, if so, who?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that -- I don\'t --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to anybody on the subject?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Outside the government?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that, but I can certainly check.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier in the week, the President said that he felt the supreme leader was aware that the people of Iran were concerned about the election -- I think it\'s a fair summary of what you said.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the case, given that the supreme leader said in his speech that Ahmadinejad had won by 11 million votes, and that the Iranians have spoken?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the international community and the United States continues to have concern about the way in which the election was conducted.\xc2\xa0 And I think that concern is pretty well held by the hundreds of thousands of people that continue to seek some sort of justice.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President disappointed to hear the supreme leader coming out -- he\'s saying that his opinion is closer to those of Ahmadinejad; they\'re closer to Ahmadinejad\'s opinion than to those of Rafsanjani, the reformist who backed Mousavi?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to get into a back and forth.\xc2\xa0 I think the President continues to be concerned about ensuring that those that seek the justice that I was just speaking about had the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to get into a comparison about --<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he still believe there are different centers of power in Iran?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'re witnessing the fact that there are different belief structures and different centers in Iran.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You actually -- just to follow up on something you had discussed in yesterday\'s briefing.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to the U.S.\'s or the White House\'s confidence in Saudi Arabia\'s relocation program with detainees that (inaudible) terror suspects over there?\xc2\xa0 And kind of on that same subject, has the White House or has the President been having discussions with anyone from Saudi Arabia, officials of the country, about taking I think it was the Yemeni detainees that are --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe that we have had discussions with the Yemeni government, and have had discussions at different levels with the Saudi government about that program and about detainees that are -- some that have been transferred, and some that are still held at Guantanamo Bay.<br/> <br/>  Obviously I think the President believes that -- and has said repeatedly, he is not going to make a decision to -- on anything related to Guantanamo that would threaten the security of our country.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to get into any depth about some of those discussions.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did that come up in his conversations --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Discussing Guantanamo definitely came up.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wondered, did the President watch Ayatollah Khomeini\'s speech?\xc2\xa0 And then --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I also wanted to ask about the House resolution.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve said repeatedly that the U.S. isn\'t going to get involved in it, but when more than 400 members of the people\'s representatives make a clear statement about it, isn\'t that the U.S. getting involved?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I think, again, let\'s -- the resolution expresses the support of all Iranian citizens who embrace the values of freedom, human rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the sort of topic sentence.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has spoken out throughout the past week on the universal principle contained in each of those values.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that expressing support for the ferment or expressing outrage in the violence is meddling in the Iranian process.<br/> <br/>  Yes, ma\'am.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if you could clarify, as far as health care tradeoffs.\xc2\xa0 When you did say that you\'re willing to reduce health care benefits and subsidies, are you in any way also including health care tax benefits and subsidies?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you in any way willing to consider reducing health care tax benefits?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve done this like 15 times and I think the President spoke pretty clearly to this in that interview that I discussed a minute ago on financial regulation earlier in the week.<br/> <br/>  Yes, sir.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 If we could go back to inspector general issue.\xc2\xa0 Senator Grassley issued two letters yesterday and since then he\'s been really pushing the AmeriCorps issue.\xc2\xa0 But he issued two letters to both the Treasury Department and the International Trade Commission regarding their inspector general.\xc2\xa0 And could someone infer that there is a trend in the administration towards inspector general based on --<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If they inferred it, it would be an incorrect inference.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/> <br/>  Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy Father\'s Day.<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Happy Father\'s Day to all you guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  3:08 P.M.
