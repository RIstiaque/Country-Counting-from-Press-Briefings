CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s everybody today?\xc2\xa0 Good, glad to hear it.\xc2\xa0 I will not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an opening announcement or statement to make, so I will head straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAssociated Press, Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you plan to answer any of our questions today about the speech?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course I do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I won\xe2\x80\x99t do with any specificity is preview or detail the elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech that he gives tomorrow afternoon at George Washington University, where he will provide the American people his vision for long-term deficit reduction and dealing with our long-term debt.\xc2\xa0 And I know you guys will cover that with interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99d actually just explain that we -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s a purpose behind this.\xc2\xa0 This is his vision, and rather than give a little here, give a little there, we\xe2\x80\x99d like the entirety of his vision to carry the day tomorrow when he gives his speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Chambliss said down in Atlanta yesterday that the White House threw the Gang of Six, obviously the bipartisan working group there, a curveball by talking about long-term debt reform on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Do you fear that the President might jeopardize those sensitive negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern of the White House at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, the President has very carefully thought through his engagement in this issue, when he would give this speech, the building blocks to reaching this point.\xc2\xa0 Along the way he has said very clearly that he supports the efforts of the so-called Gang of Six and others who are addressing these obstacles, these challenges, in a very serious way and in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a healthy and good thing.\xc2\xa0 And it is reflective of the environment that was created by the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission after it reported last year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe wants and hopes that the discussion will continue.\xc2\xa0 He has talked very clearly about the need to get this done through a conversation where everyone sits at the table and discusses a balanced way to address our long-term deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 And he will provide his vision tomorrow and looks forward to working with leaders of Congress, going forward from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said \xe2\x80\x9chis vision\xe2\x80\x9d a couple times.\xc2\xa0 Is that what we should expect -- that this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision as opposed to aligning himself with the bipartisan commission he tasked or the work on the Hill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would say, again, without previewing the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in any detail, is that -- and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been on your side of this podium and I know it can be frustrating when we\xe2\x80\x99re not previewing or giving a lot of details -- and there were a lot of stories this morning that were contradictory.\xc2\xa0 Some had the President embracing one plan; another had the President embracing another.\xc2\xa0 And all were written with great authority.\xc2\xa0 Some of them can\xe2\x80\x99t be true.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo what the President will do tomorrow -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you could clarify.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will clarify.\xc2\xa0 The President tomorrow will give his vision of what -- of how we should approach long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And it will be his.\xc2\xa0 He obviously has engaged in this issue very deeply and is aware of a variety of ideas and approaches that have been put out there from a number of sources.\xc2\xa0 But the vision that he lays out for the American people tomorrow will be his own.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last one.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the relationship between the speech and the debt ceiling vote?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The speech and the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there is a relationship between the two, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe, going back to questions I had yesterday, that there should be a link between efforts to address our long-term deficit problem and debt problem and the imperative of raising the debt ceiling, which the President and all the leaders of Congress have said has to be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt will happen, because everyone recognizes the consequences of not doing it, which would be to throw the global economy into chaos, to halt on a dime the economic recovery that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing and fought so hard to help foster.\xc2\xa0 This is not an alternative.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that the Congress will vote accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn the meantime, as the President will amply demonstrate tomorrow, he wants to have this conversation about how we can get our fiscal house in order and how we can take a balanced approach towards reducing our deficit in the long term while protecting the investments which will enable us to grow in the 21st century, which in turn will help us reduce our deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tricia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman, and even some Democrats, have said that they won\xe2\x80\x99t vote to raise the debt ceiling unless the President gives them some concrete plans for debt reduction.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to offer that tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 And is he going to offer a specific number for the amount of debt he wants to see?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tricia, I will wait for the President to lay out the specifics of his vision tomorrow, but I will simply say that we believe Congress needs to vote to raise the debt ceiling to avoid an economic -- a global economic calamity.\xc2\xa0 The President will tomorrow, once again, demonstrate his sincere commitment to reducing the deficit, to cutting spending, to getting our fiscal house in order; the commitment that he demonstrated through dealing with one of the main drivers of our long-term deficits and debt -- health care costs, which, as you know, through the Affordable Care Act will be reduced by $200 billion in 10 years and over a trillion in 20.\xc2\xa0 Serious deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Addressing one of the main drivers of the problem, which he also demonstrated again just on Friday in the agreement he reached with Speaker Boehner to finance the rest of the fiscal year with the largest nominal discretionary cut in spending in history.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he demonstrate that commitment by giving the kind of concrete numbers that people seem to be hoping to hear?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He will demonstrate that commitment clearly and vividly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to talk about taxes at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will not preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, but I will say that the President believes there has to be a balanced approach, that there is no practical way --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean tax -- raising revenues as well as cutting spending?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say more than that.\xc2\xa0 I will not say more than that.\xc2\xa0 But he believes that there has to be a balanced approach, and he demonstrated in his 2012 budget proposal that we need to consider all three legs of the stool when we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s entitlements, tax expenditures, and defense spending.\xc2\xa0 Those are the -- and, well, of course, with interest, which gets reduced if we reduce the other three.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we need to -- the only way to get there in a balanced way, in a way that spreads the burden, that makes sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair and protects the economy so that it can continue to grow and create jobs is to look at all of that as we\xe2\x80\x99re going forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did, again, in his 2012 budget.\xc2\xa0 So this is not news that he believes that these -- that you have to look at it this way.\xc2\xa0 The details I\xe2\x80\x99ll save for him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to critics who say that because of his role in the cover-up of how Pat Tillman actually died and the pain he caused the family of Pat Tillman, that General McChrystal should not be on any sort of advisory committee having to do with military families?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, the President feels strongly that General McChrystal is the right person to help lead this advisory committee on this vital issue on -- that this administration, this President, this First Lady, Dr. Biden, all believe, and of course the Vice President, all believe is vitally important, because we have now been in a situation where we have been -- we have had our men and women overseas in wars for a decade.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s important to do everything we can to remind Americans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly affected, who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a loved one in theater, that there is a need to support those families who do; that this is an effort that should involve all of us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the initiative is about, and General McChrystal is an excellent choice to help oversee that effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the role that General McChrystal played in the cover-up of Pat Tillman\xe2\x80\x99s death?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, he is aware of -- very aware, having worked closely with General McChrystal for some time, of the General\xe2\x80\x99s resume.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the CIA and the ISI and the U.S. and Pakistan, given --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want me to talk about the CIA and -- okay.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if I can get fired.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have \xe2\x80\x93- (laughter) -- are there strains between the United States and Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s government right now that are inhibiting counterterrorism efforts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that the relationship between Pakistan and the United States is very important.\xc2\xa0 The cooperation between our two countries and governments is -- continues, has been important, and continues to this day.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in a shared goal of defeating insurgents and terrorist groups.\xc2\xa0 And that cooperation continues to this day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou know, obviously, that I can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss specifics about intelligence operations, but I can tell you that the cooperation between our two countries is important and continues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before, when you were talking about the budget, you said that the White House does not see a link between the debt ceiling and a deficit reduction plan.\xc2\xa0 How can you say that when one leads to the other?\xc2\xa0 The deficit leads to the need to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 So how can the two not be linked?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s like saying that every spending bill is linked to the -- I mean, that every bill Congress passes that spends money should somehow be linked to the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re in deficit, every dollar we spend adds to that, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But that would be true of every bill that goes through Congress every week.\xc2\xa0 And my point, as you know, I know, is that the -- raising the ceiling, the debt ceiling, is so important because it involves the faith and credit of the United States government as the most powerful economy in the world -- the economy to which the whole world looks for stability.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress were not to do that, the impact would be immediate and severe, as our Treasury Secretary has described and as a plethora of outside economists described.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that part.\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s not linked to a serious deficit reduction plan, won\xe2\x80\x99t the whole world be looking and saying, they\xe2\x80\x99re just borrowing more money?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like a family taking out another credit card to borrow more money.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The point, Ed, is that the commitment shown by this Congress and this President to address the deficit was demonstrated just a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 The President will again demonstrate his commitment to it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And the demonstration just a few days ago wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just words, it\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0 It was a signed piece of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was $38 billion in cuts and a $14 trillion debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a demonstration of commitment and what the world looks at when they see the commitment of this President and this Congress to work together to address this important issue.\xc2\xa0 That will be amplified by the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat is not appropriate, given the consequences and the stakes, is to hold a positive vote on raising the debt ceiling hostage to something else, because the -- a game of chicken with our economy is a hugely risky affair that will not just be a game of who wins and who loses in the political sweepstakes here in Washington, but will have a catastrophic and direct impact on economies around the world and on Americans here, on their savings, on their interest rates, on their jobs, and on their prospects.\xc2\xa0 So this is simply not something we can mess around with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing, you mentioned the deficit -- the spending cuts from late last week.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the White House that this is actually a done deal?\xc2\xa0 There are some people on the Hill saying, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not complete yet, don\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate yet.\xc2\xa0 And the mayor of D.C., as part of your answer, was arrested yesterday, Vincent Gray, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the White House did in all this, to tell you the truth.\xc2\xa0 It looks like the District of Columbia was essentially thrown under the bus in order to get a political deal.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So can you react to him, and also --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, those are several different questions.\xc2\xa0 The deal -- the agreement was reached, the deal, as I understand it, is moving through Congress and will be signed by the President.\xc2\xa0 And it will result in the largest discretionary spending cut in history, nominal terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fact is that the compromise that was reached involved a lot of tough choices, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed and as the President has discussed.\xc2\xa0 Not everyone got what he or she wanted.\xc2\xa0 The President did not get everything he wanted.\xc2\xa0 He would not have supported this, does not support the provision that concerns the mayor.\xc2\xa0 And he is a firm supporter of D.C. home rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut in a negotiation, you have to make tough choices, and he fought hard to -- and succeeded in preventing a strenuous effort by the Republicans to de-fund Planned Parenthood, to de-fund access to women\xe2\x80\x99s health providers around the country, and felt that that was vitally important and made sure that that was preserved.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut tough choices were made, and that was one of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the budget deal, is the President asking or encouraging or expecting Democrats to vote for this thing?\xc2\xa0 Is he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he is -- he believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it involves tough choices.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- as I just described, it is not a deal that appeals in all its aspects to him or that he expects will appeal in all its aspects to other Democrats --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Democrats have said that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just as it does not appeal in all its particulars to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of compromise.\xc2\xa0 What we could not do was allow the government to shut down, and the President made sure that the deal he reached with the Speaker of the House and other leaders protected the vital investments that are his priorities and priorities of a lot of others who believe that investments in education, research and development, innovation, are key to the future, the economic future of this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo not an ideal world, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the world we live in.\xc2\xa0 So it involved tough choices, and he has made his case and will continue to make his case for why he thinks it was the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And without going into any details, of course, will the President directly or indirectly go after Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and how will he do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to say anything about -- how about Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s plan independently?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I have said and others have said is that the House Republican plan demonstrates a shared goal with the President, which is that we need to take serious action to address our long-term deficit and debt issues.\xc2\xa0 What it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrate is the kind of balance that this President believes we have to employ as we address those long-term needs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs I described before, there are three legs to this stool in terms of the drivers of our long-term deficits and debt:\xc2\xa0 entitlement spending, largely health care spending; tax expenditures; and defense spending.\xc2\xa0 The fourth leg, if you will, of the stool is interest payments on the debt, which you address by addressing the other three.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo there are three legs, and it is where we believe, where the President believes the House Republican plan fails starkly, is that it is imbalanced; it places all the burden on the middle class, on seniors, on the disabled, on people in nursing homes, through its rather drastic reform of Medicare and Medicaid -- reform which in many ways is an elimination of the established entitlements that they represent.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s not the approach the President believes is the right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I would just say that when I -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that -- it was a demonstration -- it was a recognition of the seriousness of the problem and of the fact that there is a shared goal here.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of different proposals out there, not just that one, and the President looks forward to having a conversation at the table with people who are serious about addressing this issue and serious in the way that he believes people demonstrated seriousness last week in addressing the CR for fiscal year 2011, which is you have to accept that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get everything you want, that a compromise is by definition a coming together on common ground where there\xe2\x80\x99s a consensus around the approach to take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the last word on this, I would say, is that it is -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.\xc2\xa0 But the -- the point is, is that balance is essential; that the burden has to be shared by everyone.\xc2\xa0 And what is not acceptable, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view -- and, we believe, in the American people\xe2\x80\x99s view -- is a plan that achieves serious deficit reduction only by asking for sacrifice from the middle class, seniors, the disabled, and the poor, while providing substantial tax cuts to the very well off.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not balanced.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also not particularly efficient and effective, because you cannot get there from here in a way that is stable for most Americans without addressing the three legs of the stool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President is going to make that case tomorrow, could you smile?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I think a lot of people are wondering the level of detail we\xe2\x80\x99ll get from the President tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Like the Ryan plan or not, it did have a lot of numbers.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect a lot of numbers from the President tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will go back to what I said before, which is the President will lay out a vision, and that vision will be clear and vivid tomorrow, and will make clear his priorities in this important conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Target number for what he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to cut?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY: I encourage you to attend or watch the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, let me shift gears a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An Indonesian by the name --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s about to give us everything.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s close to breaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you just ask him three times.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the way that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that is the magic.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 An Indonesian named Umar Patek was apparently captured in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 My understanding, he\xe2\x80\x99s arguably the highest-level detainee or capture since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 Any guidance on where he is and if the U.S. is questioning him at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that, Mike.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a high-value target, you would know of the plan, I would assume?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say in response to that from here.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, is there any chance you can preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For you, Chuck, in a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In all fairness, is this a -- you keep saying \xe2\x80\x9cvision.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., the President will be giving a speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you hate yourself at all when -- (laughter) --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And when -- no.\xc2\xa0 When he does, his ideas, his concept, his approach, his vision for how we need to address our long-term deficit and debt issues will be clear to you and to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Concept, approach, vision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No \xe2\x80\x9cP\xe2\x80\x9d word.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No plan.\xc2\xa0 I mean, why are you avoiding -- what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with saying \xe2\x80\x9cplan\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Is there something wrong with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that you can describe a vision as a plan.\xc2\xa0 I mean, yes, a plan lays out --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s fair.\xc2\xa0 We can describe --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- but I will not -- I will not then go from there to get into specifics about what that vision/plan/concept will include.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you plan on briefing congressional leaders before the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a practice of consulting with members of Congress, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will be kept very up to date on what the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision is for long-term deficit reduction --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they being invited down here to get a briefing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any schedule updates for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Carol.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where does Social Security fit into this vision that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This goes back to the variety of stories we saw this morning about what will or will not be in the speech tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat the President has said, Carol, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question, is that he shares the opinion that has been expressed by a number of folks that Social Security is not the primary culprit or a culprit in our near- or mid-term deficit creation problems.\xc2\xa0 He does believe, as he said in his State of the Union and elsewhere, that he believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it would be a good thing to take measures to strengthen Social Security.\xc2\xa0 But again, I encourage you to be patient with me and accept that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into what will or will not be in the speech tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect that it will be at least mentioned tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to play that.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s look forward then.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to -- is the President going to get out on the road or -- here or in some shape or form sell this plan or vision to the American people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will say without -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have scheduling announcements, but he will -- this is the beginning of a process by which he intends to engage this conversation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue and it goes beyond giving one speech.\xc2\xa0 He recognizes that it is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about major issues that have gone unconfronted and unsolved for a long time for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And therefore it requires his engagement and the engagement of other serious leaders here in Washington to address the obstacles, address the challenges, and come to some common ground on how to deliver a product to the American people that achieves the goal of reducing our deficit in a stable way that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, strengthens our economy, does not harm our recovery or our job creation, and positions us well competitively for the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as of right now there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the schedule to sort of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing -- I have no scheduling announcements to make about that.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that the moment does not end with the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2012, will the President say now that he will not sign a CR at the end of September?\xc2\xa0 He had tried not to sign short CRs during the last couple of months.\xc2\xa0 Does he want Congress on notice now that for the next five months, he really does expect them to come up with a 2012 budget?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly does believe, as he proposed his own budget several months ago, does believe that it is a far better way to do business to pass a full fiscal year budget, and he does certainly encourage and insist that Congress do that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- to predict where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in terms of 2012 budget negotiations for just that fiscal year in six, eight months is a risky business.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any surprises in the $38.5 billion as it\xe2\x80\x99s now been spelled out in the actual legislation?\xc2\xa0 What does the President think the vote will be?\xc2\xa0 Does he -- is he confident that this compromise will pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him project vote tallies, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he confident it will pass?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Abby and then Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the debt ceiling vote, Republicans have made it pretty clear that they are not interested in a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 So my question is:\xc2\xa0 What is being done at the moment to prevent the kind of nail-biting that we saw last week with the very last-minute deal being brokered on the debt ceiling, given the magnitude, as you described it, of not raising it?\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s being done to kind of make -- to bring that process along before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the Secretary of the Treasury has been in consultation with Congress; sent a letter to Congress about the imperative back in January of addressing the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We are urging this -- that this be taken up and addressed in a timely fashion, because, as you say, it is risky business to play chicken with the economy.\xc2\xa0 And playing chicken would include going up to the last minute, which creates a lot of uncertainty for the global economy, on a scale that makes last week look like something very small and local.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo in terms of the negotiations we\xe2\x80\x99re having, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details for you on that, except that I would, again, point you to the fact that every single leader in Congress of both parties has made clear that this will pass and that not pass it would be sheer folly.\xc2\xa0 We take them at their word.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are negotiations ongoing?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that the conversation with Congress began a number of months ago about the need to do this, and has continued since.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about all this punditry and writing that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead?\xc2\xa0 And will tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech solve that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The -- I thought a little bit about this, and I think that one of the unique privileges of this job is having been where you are and looking for threads and narratives.\xc2\xa0 And now, standing where I am, what I have seen is an extremely deliberate approach to this question and to leadership, which is you -- the President believes very firmly in results and having an idea, a vision, about where we should go, how we should get there, and then it comes back from there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou figure out where you want to go -- he does -- what the results should be in terms of policy and outcomes, and then you decide what are the best things I can do -- I, being the -- what the best things the President can do to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 And what that means is that -- sometimes that means not saying anything at all, publicly.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it means having very discreet conversation by phone or discreet meetings in the White House.\xc2\xa0 Sometimes it means standing here or in the East Room or giving a speech and laying out your principles, but refraining -- despite a chorus of encouragement -- refraining from flaming the opposition, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to your ultimate goal.\xc2\xa0 And you may win the day, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t get done what you think is important for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I am -- I have seen this in my time in this job, and I see now it helps explain to me, in more vivid terms, the whole process that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this President go through from the beginning when he took office, which is decisions that are hard, controversial, even unpopular, that you could -- he could have stood up and engaged in the political back-and-forth on the day and gone after his opponents and his critics.\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that at that time because he believed that it would make it harder for him to get the accomplishment that he hoped to get.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at the management of the TARP program, the bailout -- so-called bailout of the auto industry, the Recovery Act, his approach -- and I will leave out a bunch because I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at you and not at a list -- the approach to the START treaty; the approach to the relationship with Russia; the approach to dealing with Iran; the approach to Egypt and the rest of the Middle East has been very much driven by that principle of leadership.\xc2\xa0 And we believe, obviously, that that approach has paid dividends for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tJulianna.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with all the elements of the Republican congressional budget plan, does he think that Paul Ryan has provided leadership on the issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julianna, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I think that what Congressman Ryan has done is laid out his and the House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 priorities and how they approach this consequential debate.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the plan itself fails the test of balance, and that balance is essential.\xc2\xa0 But he does --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Ryan meet the test of leadership?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had this specific discussion with him, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put words in his mouth -- but I will say that leadership, courage -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot written about that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that one of the -- one measure of -- I mean, there are different -- there are levels of leadership, levels of political courage.\xc2\xa0 But one measure, certainly, is your willingness to take on the sacred cows in your own party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd what strikes me about the House Republican budget proposal is that it puts the burden on seniors, on the middle class, on the disabled.\xc2\xa0 It does not ask or put the burden on wealthier Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that, in some ways, fails that other test, too, in terms of your willingness to take on the sacred cows in your own party.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that you need to, in any negotiation, be willing to take some heat.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t Ryan taking --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would just note on those principles about the balance you find and what I think -- when we looked at the Simpson -- I mean, if you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission, and while the President has made clear and others have made clear, not every line in it is something that he could support.\xc2\xa0 What it did establish in an important way was that all those three things have to be looked at if we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about getting from here to there in terms of long-term deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The French and the British seem to be complaining that they\xe2\x80\x99re being asked to shoulder too much of the burden on Libya.\xc2\xa0 Does this call into question the idea that NATO could do something like this without the U.S. in the driving seat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have full confidence in NATO\xe2\x80\x99s capacities.\xc2\xa0 NATO is fully capable of and is achieving the goals set out for it and prescribed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.\xc2\xa0 And of course I would remind you that the -- that that resolution makes clear what the goals of the military action are and what they are not.\xc2\xa0 And the President and this administration believes that NATO and the coalition, of which we remain a partner, is capable of fulfilling that mission -- of enforcing the no-fly zone, enforcing the arms embargo, and providing civilian protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you like to see NATO members other than the British, the French, and the U.S. do more?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to NATO for operational details about how NATO should run this mission.\xc2\xa0 We are no longer in the lead.\xc2\xa0 NATO is the lead and is fully capable of executing the mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up on Steve\xe2\x80\x99s question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today we learned that Moussa Koussa, former Libyan foreign minister who was alleged to have been involved in the Lockerbie bombing, has left London to attend a meeting in Qatar, in Doha, and this meeting is being chaired by Foreign Secretary William Hague.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view on the British government allowing Moussa Koussa to travel so freely to attend these meetings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the statements that I made before about the actions that we and our allies took to put pressure on those around Muammar Qaddafi to abandon him, and also to the fact that the United Kingdom has made very clear that he is -- he was not given any kind of immunity in return for leaving the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would this administration be averse --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to \xe2\x80\x9cwould, could, if.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on that specific development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Scott was blocking me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You picked up a bad habit from the last press secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway, my height has nothing to do with anything around here.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, following up on Ed, what Ed had to say about -- the question Ed asked about Vince Gray, apparently council members and the mayor of Washington, D.C., wanted to make their feelings known about how they were portrayed in the budget -- in the budget that was -- President Obama allowing the cuts to happen in D.C.\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama reached out to Vince Gray and some of the council members?\xc2\xa0 Because they are very concerned.\xc2\xa0 This is the host city of the White House, of -- 80 percent of the government -- well, Washington -- 80 percent, I believe, of Washington, D.C., is federal land, federal buildings.\xc2\xa0 So why not talk to Vince Gray if the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t or that he won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 My point still stands that this was a tough decision.\xc2\xa0 The President is a firm supporter of D.C. home rule and continues to be that.\xc2\xa0 And the choices that had to be made in this negotiation were not easy ones, and he\xe2\x80\x99s made that clear, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear.\xc2\xa0 But again, he supports D.C. home rule and understands the importance of it to the residents of the District of Columbia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But many people are not taking this arrest lightly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the mayor of Washington, D.C., and council members were arrested because of what they felt.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House listening to what they have to say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that everyone here is aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t know what communications or conversations may have happened or are planned right now, April.\xc2\xa0 But you can certainly check back with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first is, how does the President feel about the idea of instituting statutory budget controls with some kind of automatic enforcement mechanism to control debt?\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s something that would kick in after the next election.\xc2\xa0 Has he taken a firm stance on it?\xc2\xa0 Do you know where he stands?\xc2\xa0 Is it something you\xe2\x80\x99re considering?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will -- since that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the area of long-term deficit and debt reduction, which is the area the President will be addressing in his speech, I will not preview it from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that might actually be something he\xe2\x80\x99d discuss in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s speech, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And then my other -- I just want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you count to 10 before we hang up the phone?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my other question is, some of the Republicans that I talked to say that they think that the best chance to get the Medicare reform started is precisely the debate over the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 And I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, if that could help to reach a bipartisan agreement, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with talking about it as part of the debate?\xc2\xa0 I understand when push comes to shove you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the nation to default.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to bring together liberals who are mad at President Obama for being too nice to Republicans, and Republicans who are proposing stuff you think is, like, off the deep end, then isn\xe2\x80\x99t any mechanism a good mechanism to get this done?\xc2\xa0 Or if that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to come down to, would you rather just debate it throughout an election year and then deal with it next year? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we would rather do is have the conversation and have it now.\xc2\xa0 The President is giving a major speech tomorrow that will outline his vision for long-term deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat is not acceptable, what will not make sense is linking somehow or holding hostage a vote on the debt ceiling by trying to link it to a provision -- you mentioned the Medicare reform I assume that\xe2\x80\x99s in the House Republican budget proposal, which is a non-starter.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not supported by the majority in the Congress; it\xe2\x80\x99s not supported by the American people in any recognizable numbers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something this President could sign.\xc2\xa0 So -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But he wants -- the conversation is important to have and he looks forward to having it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tKara.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why, months after signing the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow representatives of gay military families to attend today\xe2\x80\x99s event?\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a missed opportunity for the President to reaffirm his commitment to see through the repeal of the policy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I will take that question -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s office put out a statement confirming it.\xc2\xa0 They said that it\xe2\x80\x99s still the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering why -- how that\xe2\x80\x99s not a missed opportunity for you guys to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, wait.\xc2\xa0 If you want, I can take this question, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating here a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 But why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take that and get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as you know, some Democrats on the Hill are not happy with the Friday deal.\xc2\xa0 And I talked to one of them who said the impression that they get is if the Republicans dig in their heels enough and hold off long enough, the President will fold -- on the tax deal and now on this budget deal.\xc2\xa0 Why are they wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the President held out and protected his priorities.\xc2\xa0 He negotiated firmly and made sure that investments in education, investments in research and development, investments in infrastructure, the keys to our economic future, were protected, and prevented the passage of unacceptable so-called riders that would have attempted to de-fund the Affordable Care Act, de-fund family planning and women\xe2\x80\x99s health clinics, and numerous other unacceptable measures.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the reality is, is that a negotiation involves a compromise, and a compromise -- especially when you have a divided government like we have, and there is no question if the point that either Republicans on this side or Democrats on that side want to make is they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything they wanted, we concede the point.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they got 80 percent of what they wanted.\xc2\xa0 They got $80 billion.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s more than --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That is a fallacy, Bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a fallacy because it assumes that every dollar in spending cuts is a victory for Republicans and a loss for Democrats, and that\xe2\x80\x99s actually wholly inaccurate, as you know -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve been around long enough to know.\xc2\xa0 Balanced budgets -- as have I.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Balanced budgets in this town -- the last time, as I recall since I covered it, that the budget was balanced in this town through a bipartisan compromise, there was a Democrat in the White House, okay?\xc2\xa0 And this President has demonstrated very clearly that he believes we need to address our spending and our debt and our deficits.\xc2\xa0 And he would have done this regardless because he believes -- not the deal itself, because in an ideal world I made clear that there were tough choices he would not otherwise want to have to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut in terms of addressing the deficit and debt, he intended to do it and intends to it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not a Democratic priority or a Republican priority; it\xe2\x80\x99s an American priority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for our economic health, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the future of our children and grandchildren and our continued capacity to lead the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut what is also important is that you do it in a way that is balanced, that protects key investments, that protects children in Head Start, that protects Pell Grants, that protects research and development that will lead to the creation or help lead to the creation of industries in this country which will create jobs at home and enable us to lead in the industries that will dominate the 21st century around the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe is very much in favor of reducing our spending in a reasonable way, so I go back to the point -- the 80 percent suggestion is a fallacy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more.\xc2\xa0 David.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t go -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been around as long as Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Let me ask -- two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that the Ryan plan is fundamentally unfair?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second question, regarding the budget deal, what is his response to the criticism that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for job creation, that it will be a net loss of jobs?\xc2\xa0 That this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That article I believe has --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a few -- more than one person has suggested this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In the conversations I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about this is simply -- is not based on sound economics because the -- while the level of cuts was high in annual -- in terms of annual -- $38.5 billion is substantial, highest nominal reduction in domestic discretionary spending in history.\xc2\xa0 However, it does not have a substantial -- it does not have a negative impact on our economy, and I think a lot of economists would disagree with that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn fact, because it protects the investments that I\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to several times now, we believe that it finds an appropriate balance between reducing our spending and protecting the investments we need to continue to grow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe highest principle the President took into this negotiation was that we must not do anything that harms our recovery, that harms our capacity to create jobs because we\xe2\x80\x99ve clawed and scratched our way out of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and we should not do anything that harms our ability to continue to climb out of that hole, grow the economy, and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:30 P.M.
