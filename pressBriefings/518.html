CET</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good evening, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us aboard Air Force One as we make our way from Brussels to Rome.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, Ben Rhodes.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to handle most of the briefing, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to turn it over to him very quickly.\xc2\xa0 If you have any questions on topics not related to foreign policy or the trip, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you shoot now at the top.\xc2\xa0 Also, when you\xe2\x80\x99re done with that, in assist to Ben, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a readout of the U.S.-EU working lunch.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether on the Secret Service incident over the weekend, whether the President was briefed on it or told about it?\xc2\xa0 And any reaction to it?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was briefed, and I would refer you to the Secret Service in Washington on this, and say generally that the President believes, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said in the past, that everybody representing the United States of America overseas needs to hold himself or herself to the highest standards.\xc2\xa0 And he supports Director Pierson\xe2\x80\x99s approach as sort of zero-tolerance approach on these matters.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other way to characterize the President on this matter.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel satisfied that the reforms that were put into place after the incident --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into this.\xc2\xa0 I think as the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech reflected, there are truly weighty matters in the news that we can talk about.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner says that it\xe2\x80\x99s a joke that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to extend the enrollment time for Obamacare.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond specifically to what CMS has announced?\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s bending the rules?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s a joke.\xc2\xa0 A joke was the indifference with which John Boehner, Congressman Boehner --Speaker Boehner, at the time, greeted the extension under George W. Bush of the Medicare Part D enrollment for certain populations, compared to the response he\xe2\x80\x99s given today.\xc2\xa0 The only thing that has changed is that those individuals who have begun the process of applying online by the deadline, which remains March 31st, will be able to ensure that they can complete the process.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we did in December, and it worked effectively, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to what happens when you vote.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re in line before the polls close, you get to vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And I think -- I wish the Speaker were more focused on what would happen if his agenda of repeal ever became reality, which is that millions and millions of Americans, who are demonstrating in huge numbers -- I guess millions and millions is a huge number -- that they want to avail themselves of the products on healthcare.gov, would be out of luck and the insurance companies would be back in charge deciding whether they could get coverage, whether women could be charged double, whether folks with preexisting conditions could get coverage at all.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very short follow-up to that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President -- worried a couple of weeks ago that there would be a real jam at the end, a gridlock at the end, trying to get in, in those last hours.\xc2\xa0 Has he been assured that the website is going to be able to handle traffic right up to the end of the 31st?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President receives regular updates on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including the website, healthcare.gov.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we expect there to be increasing numbers as the deadline approaches.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true in situations like this when you have open enrollment periods in general.\xc2\xa0 So we expect that to be the case.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that fact probably be greeted with some form of criticism by those who want to deny Americans quality, affordable health insurance, and want to put insurance companies back in control.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll take that as it comes.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we move to foreign policy?</p>\n<p class="p6">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is sort of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s sort of view.\xc2\xa0 In the spirit</p>\n<p class="p2">of those economic sanctions on Russia, one of the goals Ben has said and Jay has said is to drive down Russian equity indexes.\xc2\xa0 On March 18th, you, Jay, recommended publicly that people short the indexes.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99ve had these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Since then, the Russian stock indexes are actually up since your short recommendation.\xc2\xa0 Do you stand by the idea that Russia is not a good place to invest right now?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that Russia has demonstrated with its actions in Ukraine, specifically in Crimea, that it is flouting international law and isolating itself.\xc2\xa0 And as many others have said, that behavior and the consequences of it, including the sanctions imposed by the United States and our international partners, will have an impact on the Russian economy, will have an impact on the Russian markets and on the Russian currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen impacts already.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">And it will most certainly have an impact on potential investors in Russia.\xc2\xa0 International investors want to know that the places they\xe2\x80\x99re investing are places where the rules of the road are followed, where the law is followed.\xc2\xa0 And Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions I think would certainly make potential investors doubtful about that.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, in addition to the market fall and the currency difficulties, indications of capital flight.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already, in the addition of the market fall and the currency fall in Russia -- for instance, the World Bank significantly downgraded its forecast for the Russian economy going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen indications of capital flight, of people not being prepared to invest in Russia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve already done, you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen that impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his speech, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue, based on their current actions in Crimea, and it would escalate substantially if the Russians escalate the situation.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the speech today?\xc2\xa0 It seemed --</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to run and leave it to Ben,\xc2\xa0 I just want to give a quick readout of the U.S.-EU lunch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">You heard the President and the two Presidents give statements after -- in the lunch.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s not much more to add.\xc2\xa0 They discussed a range of issues, including general economic development in Europe and internationally; trade,\xc2\xa0 including their joint commitment to moving forward on T-TIP;\xc2\xa0 the issue of Ukraine, in particular around energy security, as the President discussed in his statement in answer to questions -- as others did, too;\xc2\xa0 and then climate change and efforts that Europe and the United States are making in that area.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Before we get to questions, let me just briefly do the Rasmussen readout as well.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, the President thanked Secretary General Rasmussen, who is approaching the end of his term, for his really great and effective leadership of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 They briefly touched upon Afghanistan and NATO\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing efforts as we transition to end our combat mission this year and prepare for the upcoming summit in Wales.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Clearly, the focus of the discussion was on Ukraine and the situation there and, importantly, how can we reassure our NATO allies, particularly those in Eastern Europe.\xc2\xa0 You saw we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken certain steps with the Baltic overflights and the Polish aviation detachment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to you about.</p>\n<p class="p4">What he spoke to him about today is that going forward we will be increasing our rotations of ground and naval forces to NATO allies to complement those aviation deployments.\xc2\xa0 The United States is prepared to join those commitments so that we have a continuous presence to reassure our allies in terms of ground, naval and air assets going forward.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a NATO ministerial next week at which this will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 Again, the U.S. will be making commitments to that effort.\xc2\xa0 We expect other European partners to step up and join us in doing so, other NATO allies, of course.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll be putting together the elements of that package.</p>\n<p class="p4">But the key point here is that we want to make sure that there is a continuous presence that draws on the different capabilities of NATO -- air, ground and naval -- to reassure our allies going forward that we\xe2\x80\x99re also looking at our collective defense planning so that we are prepared for any contingency to meet our Article 5 obligations to our NATO allies.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you just said, have you talked about that before?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We alluded to it in the factsheet.\xc2\xa0 There were some questions, so I want to be clear that what we\'re talking about is we have the ability to do rotational deployments to our Eastern European allies.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve done aviation; we are planning to expand that to ground and naval as well.\xc2\xa0 That will be put together over the course of the next several days with NATO as they get ready for a ministerial next week.\xc2\xa0 But we are prepared to join that effort, we will be joining that effort, and people should expect those --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s more stuff?</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, what does that practically mean on the ground?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen airplanes dispatched to Poland and the Baltics.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen personnel dispatched in support of that aviation mission.\xc2\xa0 And I think you will see additional personnel and assets associated with ground and naval reassurance going forward.</p>\n<p class="p2">Again, we will be putting together the specifics with NATO in part because this won\'t just be U.S. unilateral actions, these will be taken in concert with NATO.\xc2\xa0 And that was a discussion they had today, and the decisions on that will be made over the course of the next several days leading into the ministerial.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided on what countries they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go to?\xc2\xa0 Are they also -- is it Poland?\xc2\xa0 Is it that same kind of complement of countries that the aviation --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t give you -- I don\'t want to give a specific list because NATO will be putting this together.\xc2\xa0 But clearly, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia have been a focus for us.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re looking broadly across our NATO alliance and particularly our allies in the East.\xc2\xa0 And our intent is to provide them with concrete reassurance and collective self-defense planning.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you broadly -- the President seemed to make the case in the speech for a refocus on Europe by both the United States and other nations after a lot of talk that you guys had about focusing elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And so I guess I\'m wondering, A, is that your intention to really reset or refocus or pivot -- or however you want to put it -- back to Europe?\xc2\xa0 And if so, other than the thing that you just said, are there specific, concrete things that will flow out of that, that will undergird that so that it\'s not just rhetoric but that there\xe2\x80\x99s actually a change in the way that America and the rest of the world deal with Europe?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There was a lot in there, so let me -- first of all, in terms of concrete steps that we\'re going to take, look, on the security side, this is an ongoing process of NATO reassurance and NATO planning.\xc2\xa0 And so this will unfold over a period of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And the point is that we want our Eastern European allies to be reassured, and that will be manifested in the way in which we cooperate, the exercises we do, and the types of deployments that we undertake.</p>\n<p class="p2">We already have NATO, so this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re operating within an existing framework that exists in part for this purpose, to provide for Article 5 defense of the alliance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">In terms of other steps, concretely you\'re going to see a significant amount of economic assistance for Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The United States portion of that includes our $1 billion loan guarantee, which we\'re working to finalize with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve indicated additional technical assistance we can provide for the Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0 There is a very large IMF package that is being finalized that I think will indicate the seriousness of our support for Ukraine and its economy.\xc2\xa0 Other European countries have stepped up to make multibillion-dollar commitments to Ukraine if you add that up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So the point is it will manifest itself in both the NATO reassurance and the investment in NATO\xe2\x80\x99s collective defense, but also the support for the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to be the clearest indication in terms of backing up exactly what the President said today and being united with the people and government of Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">I\'ll just make two more points, though, Michael.\xc2\xa0 One is, look, we have always been invested in Europe.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been the cornerstone of everything we\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 If you look at what the President said at Brandenburg Gate, what he said in Westminster, we\'ve always seen our European allies as the cornerstone of what we do in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\'re not going to focus in other regions.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to Asia next month.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to Asia twice this year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on an ambitious trade agreement in Asia.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very involved with our Japanese and Korean allies who we just met with in confronting the threat posed by North Korea.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very involved in participating with Southeast Asian nations in efforts to defuse tensions associated with maritime disputes.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a significant agenda in Asia that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue that is not going to be impacted by what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Europe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But the other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is part of what the President said today is it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that the United States is focused on Europe, it\xe2\x80\x99s that Europe needs to come together and meet this challenge with us in terms of what the Russians have done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about what we are doing for Europe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what Europe and the United States are doing together to confront Russian aggression, to be willing to move to the types of sanctions that have already had a cost and that could have a far greater cost on the Russians, and also to support the Ukrainian people and government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to think that there is or there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a significant new focus by the United States on Europe in the weeks and months and years ahead?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 There is a significant new focus on the fact that Russia just invaded Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if this is about the fact that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention to Europe.\xc2\xa0 This is about the fact that we now have a European country that has been invaded by Russia.\xc2\xa0 So I think this focus will manifest itself above all on how do we stand together to combat aggression in Ukraine, how do we support the Ukrainian government, how do we reassure allies.</p>\n<p class="p4">And, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the Europeans to step up to the plate with the type of support they\xe2\x80\x99ve provided to the Ukrainians, the type of sanctions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already moved to and have indicated they could go to if Russia escalates, but also in terms of their commitments to NATO.\xc2\xa0 And you heard the President say today now it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for NATO countries to step up, to invest more in the capabilities that NATO needs, to invest more resources in collective defense.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Ben, all of that said, this is the first time that the President has come to Brussels during his time in office.\xc2\xa0 The Europeans feel a little neglected.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you felt the need to address today?\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the President addressed it at the top of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 Is there any tension?\xc2\xa0 Or is that -- or \xe2\x80\x9ctension\xe2\x80\x9d may be the wrong word\xc2\xa0 -- but any hurt feelings that you feel he needed to address?\xc2\xa0 Or has that been swept aside because of Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the unity of the United States and Europe on display.\xc2\xa0 I mean, first of all, we planned to come to Brussels for some time, predating the crisis in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I think over the last several days at the G7 and the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings with European leaders, and the comments that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard publicly from European leaders and in his speech today, what you saw is a reaffirmation of the importance of the transatlantic alliance.</p>\n<p class="p4">And I would encourage you, if you go back and look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech even at Brandenburg Gate, he said that too often we take it for granted, our alliance, the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 The President has always been very attuned to the fact that a successful Europe and a prosperous Europe is at the core of our strategy in the world and our own security and prosperity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">But, again, I think what this crisis in Ukraine has done has simply heightened the urgency.\xc2\xa0 And what we believe is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the transatlantic alliance meet the test over the course of the last several days at the G7 in all the discussions he\xe2\x80\x99s had and certainly in the meetings he had today with the EU and NATO. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Edward Snowden has come up often, not often in his talks.\xc2\xa0 Are leaders bringing it up with him?\xc2\xa0 Is he explaining anything about that?\xc2\xa0 I guess, if you could just measure that for us in terms of the --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be completely candid.\xc2\xa0 It has not come up frequently at all.\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check if it came up at all today.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it being a significant topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The fact of the matter is when we were here several months ago it was a much greater topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 I think the combination of the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced some reforms, we\xe2\x80\x99ve briefed our European allies on those reforms, it addresses a process that will allow for us to grant more protections to European citizens and European heads of state in terms of how we conduct surveillance.\xc2\xa0 And then, when you also factor in the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with Ukraine, it just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the same level of topic that it was in the past.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, just before we let you go, can you give us a little preview of the meeting with the Pope tomorrow and what the President is thinking going into that?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 First of all, you always welcome the opportunity to meet with the Pope.\xc2\xa0 But in particular, the President -- I think like many people around the world -- has been inspired by the first year that Pope Francis has had, by the way in which he has motivated people around the world by his message of inclusion, of equality, which has deep meaning for people both of the Catholic faith, but people of different faiths all over the world.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for them to get to know each other personally, for the President to hear from the Pope about what he is trying to do around the world, and really for the President to express his appreciation for the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s leadership on a range of challenges that he has highlighted in his first year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n8:03 P.M.
