EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so let\xe2\x80\x99s get started with your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so on the bus tour, anything that the President is going to roll out on jobs?\xc2\xa0 Republicans say he\xe2\x80\x99s run out of ideas. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Republicans would say that.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President speak quite a bit about the need to grow our economy, to accelerate hiring, and he looks very much forward to getting out in the country and talking to workers, small businessmen and women, other private sector actors, local government officials to hear from them what\xe2\x80\x99s happening out in this part of the country and what ideas they have to continue economic growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did say he was going to roll out a new idea every week.\xc2\xa0 Now, this is the start of a new week, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take that literally.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot from the President on the things we can be doing to improve economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific proposal to tell you that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to announce at a certain time and place, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to pay attention to what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying on this trip, because he will be focusing exclusively on the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about this visit -- the districts that we\xe2\x80\x99re visiting and how those were chosen?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we can talk more about that.\xc2\xa0 I think that what this trip allows him to do is visit some communities in three different states that, in some cases, would be very hard to reach.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why having a bus is so helpful.\xc2\xa0 The President needs to get out in the country and meet with real folks in real places.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, a plane this size is hard to get into small communities and small airports.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s really looking forward to this; we all are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to get out and hear from people.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got town halls, a number of them, as you know, and he expects to hear a lot about the real economy out here and to be able to explain to folks here or in the states where we\xe2\x80\x99re going, where he thinks the country needs to go, what the federal government can do working with the private sector to grow the economy and create jobs, which is his number one priority.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, any new special significance to going to Minnesota today, given the results of the straw poll in Iowa this weekend?\xc2\xa0 Michele Bachmann --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unrelated.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is about a part of the country where we\xe2\x80\x99re able to hit three states with interesting economies and places that we can visit.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly unrelated to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, Minnesota does have a significantly lower unemployment rate than the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 What does he expect to hear there that would --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One of the things that he expects -- he wants to hear about is to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s working in those communities where, as you say, unemployment is lower, where there have been economic successes, where businesses are starting or businesses that existed are growing and hiring.\xc2\xa0 He very much wants to hear about that and see what we can learn about applying ideas that may be effective in some parts of the countries to other -- in some parts of the country to other parts of the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you mentioned Republican politics, do you have any reaction to Rick Perry\xe2\x80\x99s entering into the Republican race or what he\xe2\x80\x99s running on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the mood in the country right now seems particularly dark.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating in the latest Gallup poll dipped below 40 for the first time.\xc2\xa0 What does he intend to do to sort of buck people up, and also to sort of get people to understand that he really does have a plan for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk -- well, first of all, I would just say that the economic uncertainty that exists out in the country explains the way people feel, and economic security is what this President is very focused on providing -- helping provide to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what he will do, as you saw him do last week in Michigan, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll do here in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois, is talk very specifically about what we need to do going forward, what we need to do in Washington and around the country to improve -- promote growth and accelerate job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think he looks very much forward to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think at this point that that\xe2\x80\x99s getting through, and is he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot of people -- we went through a process that was -- for anyone out in the country who have -- which is everybody, almost -- who has their own lives to pay attention to and making ends meet, they just saw a lot of political gridlock and they saw Congress -- in this case, the Republicans -- being willing to hold the economy hostage to a political agenda.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, fortunately, in the end, when the final issue on the table was the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 desire, insistence, absolute insistence, that we go through this circus again in a few short months and cause all that economic uncertainty, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s insistence, absolute insistence, that that not happen, Republicans blinked and the President ensured that we would not go through this circus again and that the debt ceiling would be extended through 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a bottom-line, absolute essential accomplishment out of an ugly process.\xc2\xa0 We also locked in deficit reduction, a trillion dollars, that both sides were able to agree on, and a process that will hopefully, if super -- if the super committee lives up to its name, that hopefully will create a balanced approach towards further significant deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it your read that out of those debt negotiations, the bottom line is the Republicans blinked at the end?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that this President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- this President worked as hard as he could to try to convince -- work with Speaker Boehner and try to convince him, and they both negotiated in good faith to achieve a grand compromise with sweeping deficit reduction that would have affected our long-term fiscal health.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the Speaker walked away from the table.\xc2\xa0 The President still believes we need to address those issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Once that was no longer a possibility, the bottom line was that we needed to ensure that we -- for our economy, for our -- so that we would not default on our obligations and create the economic uncertainty that the game of chicken had caused and would cause again, the bottom line was we had to make sure that we extended the debt ceiling for a significant period of time as opposed to letting this kind of economic uncertainty play out again in just a few short months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was the -- as you know, because you covered it, Republicans insisted that we do that again.\xc2\xa0 The President insisted that that was not acceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned their lesson?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you think that the super committee will actually benefit by the fact that we have seen this pretty nasty dislocation in the markets?\xc2\xa0 Is it your sense that this is going to be a better negotiation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see, because super is as super does -- (laughter) -- and the committee has an opportunity to take its assignment seriously and responsibly, and to achieve something significant that will allow -- send the message around the country and the globe that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting our fiscal house in order by dealing with the long-term drivers of our deficit and debt, and addressing it in a balanced way that ensures that no sector of our society is unfairly burdened and has to bear all the sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it ensures that Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, has to contribute a little bit, has to share in some of the sacrifice, as he noted on the op-ed page of The New York Times today, that\xe2\x80\x99s required to get our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people want to protect, or as Warren Buffet says, coddle the super rich, and we -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas for adding revenues to a balanced package of deficit reduction are entirely reasonable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys spent a long time talking about compromise and made it very clear that the President was the one willing to compromise and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he wants, is people to work together.\xc2\xa0 And then last week in Michigan his --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what the public wants.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but let me -- but last week in Michigan, his tone was much sharper, where he was talking about who was to blame for this not getting done, and who was playing politics, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what we\xe2\x80\x99re -- which tone is going to dominate the next few days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people, by any measure, any data that you might have looked at, understood that the President was trying to work in a spirit of compromise with Republicans to find a solution that was fair and balanced.\xc2\xa0 And while polls go up and down, I would say that the historically low assessment that the public is giving to Congress is a reflection of how they felt that process played out and the role of some in Congress in that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact is that, again, in all the data that you can look at, the American people, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re Democrats or independents or even Republicans, are saying they want compromise.\xc2\xa0 And we feel like that message should and will get through to the people who were sent here by the American people -- were sent to Washington by the American people to represent them in Washington, and that, if that happens, then the super committee has the potential to be super and to do something significant and balanced that represents a compromise approach to deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think by pointing out the dissatisfaction with Washington and pointing out what the public wants, I think the President is making clear that everyone -- every one of the elected leaders in Washington, Congress and in the White House -- need to be responsive to what the public is demanding in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go foreign policy and your assessment of the developments in Libya over the weekend.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming increasingly clear that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered, that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- his isolation is -- grows more extreme as each day passes, and as we have for a long time, we believe that the people of that country, of Libya, need -- deserve the right to choose their own future.\xc2\xa0 And we have obviously done a lot to support their efforts to ensure that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s regime no longer had the capacity or has the capacity to attack the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 And we, as I said, note the fact that the pressure on him continues to increase.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President also spoke to foreign leaders since Friday over Syria; I imagine what any new developments there -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the President thinking about Assad and the continued violence on the Syrian people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Assad has to cease the systematic violence, mass arrests, and the outright murder of his own people.\xc2\xa0 By his actions he has demonstrated that he has lost legitimacy to lead, and the President has no doubt that Syria will be better off without him.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people deserve a peaceful transition to democracy; they deserve a government that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t torture them, arrest them and kill them.\xc2\xa0 And we are looking, together with a broad array of international partners, to increase pressure on President Assad.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report today in The New York Times also that says that among the options under discussion is extending the payroll tax credit to employers, and also another tax credit to encourage businesses to hire more.\xc2\xa0 Are these some of the options that the President is considering?\xc2\xa0 And then, how -- this week, how does the President explain sort of the idea of tax breaks to spur the economy but also knowing that that\xe2\x80\x99s then going to create a deeper hole in the debt?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The President has been explicit about some of the ideas that he thinks Congress should work with him to accomplish, including patent reform, passing the free trade agreements, extending the payroll tax cut that was implemented for this year -- extending it to next year.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously looking at other options. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also talked about the need to -- for Congress to act on an infrastructure bank or fund, leveraging a relatively small amount of public money to get the private sector engaged in rebuilding our infrastructure, rehiring -- hiring back construction workers -- out-of-work construction workers; we think that would be a very good thing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific other ideas that the President may or may not put forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tax cut aspect of it, I think that as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about both the -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the payroll tax cut extension on the employee side, I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been amply demonstrated by economists wholly unaffiliated with the administration that it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- one of the better ways or best ways to promote economic growth, because you are giving a tax cut to every working American that puts on average $1,000 in the pockets of the average American family.\xc2\xa0 And that money tends to be spent, and the spending of that money both helps those families make ends meet, helps them make their house payments or their car payments, but it also gets injected into the economy, which then helps other businesses and helps growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 So we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very positive thing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously considering a broad array of ideas. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the issue of -- I mean, we obviously have a two-pronged problem, if you will.\xc2\xa0 We need to do what we can to promote economic growth and job creation, and we need to take necessary measures to get our long-term deficit and debt problems under control.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not mutually exclusive.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have to do it wisely.\xc2\xa0 You have to make sure that the things you do to promote growth and job creation are very effective, targeted, and you need to make sure that the measures you take to reduce the deficit and debt are not implemented in a way that actually constrains growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, setting aside the political realities in Congress right now, would the President prefer to have the ability to enact a stimulus like he did in 2009, something that would put the economy back on a stronger --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is very focused on what can be done to spur growth and job creation, and to unleash -- to get businesses hiring again and to increase the kind of consumer demand that helps spur growth, and that goes to the payroll tax cut extension that I talked about. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when you say what can be done, are you including in that what the political reality is?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the political reality is always in flux.\xc2\xa0 And I think that a lot of this -- you cannot -- we obviously are aware of and have our ideas about what Congress may or may not be willing to do.\xc2\xa0 But that reality is ever-changing, depending on the state of the economy and the state -- and the kind of -- and what members of Congress are hearing back from their constituents out in the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we remain optimistic that if people return to work serious about the need to grow the economy and create jobs, as well as serious about the need to deal with our deficits and debt in a balanced way, that we can get a lot done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been talking with Boehner or McConnell, or have there been staff contacts to sort of work out how all this will go down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any communications like that that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of or to read out to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about -- you addressed last week that this was an official trip and not a political trip, but could you explain what the difference is from what people see between an official trip and a political trip?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President, as you know, has taken some trips where he\xe2\x80\x99s raised money for his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the President is not engaged in a primary election and he is doing what Presidents do, which is go out in the country and engage with the American people, have discussions about the economy and other policy issues.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s having a Rural Economic Forum tomorrow, for example, as well as meeting with a host of local business leaders and private sector players in the economy -- local economy.\xc2\xa0 And that would be -- to suggest that any time the President leaves Washington it\xe2\x80\x99s a political trip would mean that Presidents could never leave unless they were physically campaigning on their own behalf, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not; he\xe2\x80\x99s out here doing his job and meeting with the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that Americans are fully aware of the intensity with which the President was working in Washington, in the White House, during the days and weeks that led up to the resolution of the debt ceiling crisis.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also -- part of his job is not just sitting down with leaders of Congress or around the table in the Cabinet Room, but engaging with Americans from different parts of the country and different walks of life and different sectors of the economy to talk about his ideas to grow the economy and spur job creation, and to hear from them what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing and seeing, and their ideas as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just an Iraq question -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about the various bombings in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Does that in any way change our posture there or our timetable?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously there have been attacks and we strongly condemn them.\xc2\xa0 The overall picture is one where violence has been down.\xc2\xa0 And in addressing your question, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change where we are in the process of drawing down our troops or change the fact that we are, as we have said, in discussions with the Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 And if they make some kind of request we certainly would consider it.\xc2\xa0 But right now we\xe2\x80\x99re operating under the status of forces agreement reached between the two governments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
