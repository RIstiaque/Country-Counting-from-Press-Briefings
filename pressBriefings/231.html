EAT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good morning, everybody. \xc2\xa0I appreciate you bearing with us through some of the logistical challenges this morning. \xc2\xa0And I know that we\'ve got a handful of reporters here in the room and then reporters from a couple of other locations that will be participating in today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the beginning of the briefing, as you can see, standing here alongside me are some business leaders from the United States that have traveled here to Africa to participate in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit. \xc2\xa0And what I thought I would do is invite each of them individually to spend two or three minutes talking about their experience at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit and to talk about the significance of investing in entrepreneurship and economic opportunity here in Africa, and why it\'s significant that the President is spending his time on it and what the consequences are for the economy here in Africa, but also for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\'ll introduce them one by one. \xc2\xa0What we\'ll do is I\'ll invite each of them to start with two or three minutes of opening comments, and then what I would do is we\'ll open up the floor to questions for them. \xc2\xa0And then Ben and I will hang around afterwards if there are questions on other topics that we can spend a little time answering those questions, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me first introduce -- nearly to my right is Steve Case, the CEO of Revolution. \xc2\xa0And then to his right is Julie Hanna, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Executive Chair of the Board at Kiva. \xc2\xa0And to her right is Daymond John, the CEO and founder of FUBU. \xc2\xa0And then on the end is Nils Tcheyan, who is the Director of Government Relations for GE Africa. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Steve, you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0And thanks to all of you for being here. \xc2\xa0I think the headlines from my perspective are we\'re now seeing the globalization of entrepreneurship, number one; number two, Africa is open for business not just for the large companies or the private equity funds, but increasingly for venture capitalists backing startups; and number three, Kenya particularly, and Nairobi particularly, is really quickly emerging as a quite vibrant startup community.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of globalization of entrepreneurship, we\'re proud of Silicon Valley; it continues to be the envy of the world. \xc2\xa0It will continue to do great, but we\'re now seeing entrepreneurship both regionalized within the United States -- what we call the \xe2\x80\x9crise of the rest,\xe2\x80\x9d as regions all across the United States are showing real momentum as startup communities -- and also the globalization. \xc2\xa0And we\'re seeing that happen certainly in many, many parts of Europe -- London is very strong; Helsinki is very strong; Stockholm is very strong. \xc2\xa0But now we\'re starting to see it in Africa as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I came a few days early and met a lot of entrepreneurs -- there was a pitch competition at the iHub in Nairobi. \xc2\xa0Great companies pitched ad we picked and invested in -- we made half a dozen investments here in the last couple years. \xc2\xa0I think that will accelerate. \xc2\xa0From here, this afternoon we\'re going on to Ghana and then Nigeria, doing similar things. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s really great momentum around Africa. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition that over the past decade Africa has shifted from a problem we need to solve by government aid and philanthropic support to more of an opportunity we need to seize and bring investors and entrepreneurs to the forefront.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s happening is really quite remarkable. \xc2\xa0I met several companies that could go public in the next two or three years -- billion-dollar valuations in Nairobi. \xc2\xa0So this isn\'t just small companies focused on meeting the needs in Kenya or Africa; it\'s companies based here that are starting to have global ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s encouraging to see. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s great that the President has made the Global Entrepreneurship Summit a high-profile event -- a thousand people here, for example. \xc2\xa0And it\'s really a recognition that it\'s in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest to have a safe and prosperous world, and the best way to do that is to have strong economies all over the world. \xc2\xa0And the best way to do that is to back the entrepreneurs who really are building the startups -- the seed corn, if you will, that someday some of those will be the big companies that really help create the jobs and the hope and the opportunities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s been a great week. \xc2\xa0It\'s great to -- it has been such a focus of the White House; entrepreneurship really is kind of critical. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve seen time and time again that startups really can change the world and they can change the world out of Africa as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. HANNA: \xc2\xa0Hello. \xc2\xa0Kiva has worked in the region -- actually was founded in 2005, working with entrepreneurs in the region. \xc2\xa0And I would say that what\xe2\x80\x99s particularly profound about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened this week is that entrepreneurialism as a mindset is an inherent part of the Kenyan culture and of the culture of sub-Saharan Africa -- that\'s what we found 10 years ago when we began funding entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it began with one entrepreneur -- a Ugandan fishmonger who was a single mother of five, who couldn\'t afford to scale her business and get enough profit to send her children to school. \xc2\xa0And one loan funded by -- by five people allowed her to do that. And she paid back the loan and she grew her business.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince that time, there are 240,000 entrepreneurs like Elizabeth that have been funded in sub-Saharan Africa, and have received $170 million in loans. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve repaid those loans at 98 percent. \xc2\xa0And it speaks to the fact that the entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve been working in a grassroots way to enable them over this period of time. \xc2\xa0And it speaks to, on a global basis, 1.6 million people like Elizabeth have received loans and almost $700 million in that time.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what\xe2\x80\x99s important about this week is that this grassroots movement, the informal kind of recognition of entrepreneurialism as a backbone of this culture, is being elevated and more formally recognized. \xc2\xa0And I think we\'ll look back and see this as a real inflection point. \xc2\xa0Just seeing on the ground the response to GES, to President Obama being here, it\'s -- one of the things that we find in Silicon Valley that\'s so vital to entrepreneurship is elevating and amplifying role models, and really helping people ignite the entrepreneurial spark that we all have within us. \xc2\xa0Because ultimately entrepreneurship is about wanting to -- the relentless pursuit of a better way and it is about wanting to create a future you want to live in. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the more young people and women and marginalized members of society world view that as an option, then there\xe2\x80\x99s a hope of driving an innovation economy, of achieving economic stability. \xc2\xa0And ultimately that plants the seeds for nation stability and it can change the fate of a nation ultimately. \xc2\xa0That\'s my belief.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. JOHN: \xc2\xa0Hi, thank you for being here. \xc2\xa0I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to expect -- I was very hopeful about when I would take the trip out here. \xc2\xa0I\'ve had stores and distribution in South Africa for quite some time. \xc2\xa0And probably about 12 years ago, we initially opened it up, our stores. \xc2\xa0And the sentiment amongst the youth and really men of color was that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even walk into some of the stores that I opened up at that time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEverything has changed. \xc2\xa0I come out here and I realize -- I happen to be on a show in the States called \xe2\x80\x9cShark Tank,\xe2\x80\x9d and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it was aired out here. \xc2\xa0I can\'t walk down the streets. \xc2\xa0It\'s these amazing young men and women who walk up to me and say to me how they\xe2\x80\x99re an entrepreneur and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to change the world themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tI happen to come from a middle- to lower-class neighborhood, and there was a lot of challenges in the neighborhood. \xc2\xa0And people would prey off of the fact that some of us -- or many of us didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any hope. \xc2\xa0I decided to start a clothing line. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think anything of it besides I just wanted to dress people. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know that I was calling myself an entrepreneur. \xc2\xa0At that time, I was told an entrepreneur was somebody that sets your house on fire and then sells you a water hose. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So I always thought that it was something that I couldn\'t do myself.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\'ve employed thousands of people from that time in (audio drop). \xc2\xa0And everybody in my neighborhood now wants to be a businessperson, and it\xe2\x80\x99s changed an entire neighborhood -- and hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s changed the country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s when I started to realize that the word FUBU for the buyers was created for a culture and not a color was something that was about empowerment.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, when I came over here and I see all these individuals that want to be self-sufficient, they want to change the world and feed themselves and do things of that nature, they think out of the box. \xc2\xa0As an American, I\xe2\x80\x99m a little jaded. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m busy trying to come up with the next app to sell women a hot pair of shoes. \xc2\xa0These individuals are coming up with apps and/or things that are social causes. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m realizing that 25 percent of the world lights their houses with -- or has light with kerosene, little cans that may be dangerous to their health. \xc2\xa0And these individuals here are finding solar solutions to them. \xc2\xa0They are thinking outside of the box, and they are empowering themselves and they\xe2\x80\x99re empowering their community. \xc2\xa0And more importantly, the whole world is at our fingertips with these little digital devices that will be no further than six feet away from them for the next 97 percent of our lives. \xc2\xa0And with communicating that way, they can also communicate and empower themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver the last three years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met over 100 entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0That started off in one years, and doing over a million dollars off of their cellphones. \xc2\xa0And we need to educate these individuals on how they can do that and empower themselves -- women and children. \xc2\xa0I think a mom is the ultimate startup; I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that. \xc2\xa0A mother gives birth to a child, and there is no defined way or blueprint. \xc2\xa0Every single instance is different. \xc2\xa0And if we understand that, they truly are entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0They take affordable next steps, they figure it out. \xc2\xa0And no matter what, they find a way to work it out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that being here and dealing and working with so many amazing entrepreneurs and seeing all these things out here, I have about four investments that I\xe2\x80\x99m currently thinking about, as well as I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to the telecom and communication decision-makers over here to not only provide opportunities for entrepreneurs, but provide other content to also educate them as well, and entertain them like we do in \xe2\x80\x9cShark Tank.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll be getting some advice from the creator of the content. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to be here, and I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s journey here has opened my eyes. \xc2\xa0I will be sharing this with every single investor that I know personally. \xc2\xa0And I am going to return here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to be a PAGE ambassador with Steve, Julie, and Brian and everybody else. \xc2\xa0Thank you for having me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. TCHEYEN: \xc2\xa0Good morning. \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering why is GE at the entrepreneurial conference. \xc2\xa0So the first thing is, as a company we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here for about 100 years, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve really expanded tremendously over the last five or six years. \xc2\xa0So when we think about entrepreneurship, and you look at kind of the growth and you look at the development that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in Africa, a lot of the entrepreneurial solutions that are found are aimed at addressing problems that arise partly because there are real problems, and partly because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lack of infrastructure that\xe2\x80\x99s enabling faster solutions. \xc2\xa0So these are solutions that overcome the gap in infrastructure that there is. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s already shown tremendous power, resilience, and innovation in overcoming those problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo from our perspective, there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge market here for infrastructure -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s power generation, transportation, health care, aviation. \xc2\xa0So from our perspective, if you can unleash all of that potential by providing them with stronger, more affordable, available and reliable infrastructure, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to really build on a tremendous growth record that the region has had over the past decade. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we focus on large infrastructure. \xc2\xa0Over the course of this week, we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced some deals -- Kipeto wind project. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going some big facilities in Nigeria, in Angola and elsewhere. \xc2\xa0We have a large health care modernization project that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here. \xc2\xa0But we actually bridge that to entrepreneurship. \xc2\xa0So if you think about health care and you think about the power of communications enabling people to read images remotely -- so you can\xe2\x80\x99t get a doctor in every village; in fact, you might be lucky to have a nurse in every village -- you can get people to read scans remotely. \xc2\xa0If you have the technology to do the scan and transmit it back where a doctor can read it, and then advise the nurse on the course of treatment for a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s pregnant and reduce child and infant mortality, huge gains will be made and are being made.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are so many young people here who are looking at ways of finding solutions to some of those problems. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s really the bridge that we see between entrepreneurship, growth, and the large kind of infrastructure that we do.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99re investing not just in our own projects; we\xe2\x80\x99re partners with the Young African Leaders Initiative. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re partners with Power Africa. \xc2\xa0We are looking for ways to really multiply the impact of GE investments, both through our own direct training and through our partnerships with local institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe also announced this week that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing GE Garages in Nairobi. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s basically a way of giving people an insight into what advanced manufacturing is, what kinds of skills are necessary to develop advanced manufacturing, and to help African entrepreneurs and businesspeople absorb the kinds of technologies and skills that they need to really take on much more manufacturing and value added in the region. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in a partnership with SevenSeas Technology, with Gearbox -- which is a local startup, and with the University of Nairobi Technical Center. \xc2\xa0And it will be basically a facility that will be permanent in Nairobi.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited to be here, extremely appreciative of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts not just on this trip, but throughout his trip in 2013 and 2014 to really bring this message that Africa is an investment destination, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an investment destination where U.S. companies have to get now. \xc2\xa0Because if you\xe2\x80\x99re not here now, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss this kind of market.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo thanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Great. \xc2\xa0So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we start by seeing if there are any questions from the pool, and then -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll sort of try and do this in an orderly fashion, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to in the room in just a minute.</p>\n<p>\n\tQuestions for the business leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, Josh, this is Julie with the pool. \xc2\xa0We defer our questions to everybody else that just went.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first one in the room here. \xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Gregory Warner with NPR. \xc2\xa0My question is the focus on tech entrepreneurship, which has been so highlighted on this trip. \xc2\xa0Tech businesses are not large employers; they don\xe2\x80\x99t need a lot of manpower like manufacturing, especially considering the education levels of the African workforce. \xc2\xa0So if the emphasis on entrepreneurship is presented as a way to grow jobs in Africa, to give people hope -- give young people hope for the future. \xc2\xa0Is emphasis on tech entrepreneurship the best bang for the buck?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Steve, do you want to do this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the emphasis is on entrepreneurship more broadly, and there are a lot of different sectors of the economy. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s true in the United States as well as in Kenya and other places around the world. \xc2\xa0A lot of opportunities for disruption in health care and education and energy and transportation and food and government services. \xc2\xa0There are a lot of big sectors that haven\'t really been disrupted that much by the last couple waves of technology. \xc2\xa0I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a lot of that in the next decade, and there will be a lot of job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, as you say, there are some sectors where technology automates things and there is some job destruction. \xc2\xa0I think the next generation of entrepreneurs are going to focus on impact investing where it\xe2\x80\x99s profit plus purpose and part of the purpose will be around job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to this area specifically, I actually met several companies this week that are tech-oriented startups -- like M-KOPA, which is doing things around energy in rural villages. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve hired 650 people in the last four years and have over a thousand entrepreneurs -- growing to several thousand entrepreneurs -- out in the field selling that product. \xc2\xa0So that\'s a case of something which is a tech startup that actually already created a couple thousand jobs in just a few years. \xc2\xa0And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a lot more of those in the years to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. TCHEYAN: \xc2\xa0Josh, can I --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, please do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. TCHEYAN: \xc2\xa0I think that\'s an excellent point, and I think that\'s one of the things, when you look at advanced manufacturing as well, it\'s going to generate fewer direct jobs, but if you think of an expanding economy and you think of the kind of supplier development that can come as people are feeding into not just a local supply chain, which is going to be very important, but into a global supply chain -- that\xe2\x80\x99s really where you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the multiplication of jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we basically look at, for every job that we create directly at GE, in the U.S., the multiplier is roughly eight jobs to supplier. \xc2\xa0In Africa, the multiplier is far less. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know what the exact number is, but maybe it\'s one to one. \xc2\xa0We think that number can be pushed up much higher by getting the economies to grow faster, bringing more manufacturing here. \xc2\xa0So it\'s going to be the volume of manufacturing, and not as much the direct employment, that\'s created by each enterprise.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. JOHN: \xc2\xa0Everything has a tech aspect to it these days, and everybody has talked about how the clothing industry has taken a big hit. \xc2\xa0The clothing industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken a big hit; it\'s just 200,000 kids now selling a million dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of stuff out of their home. \xc2\xa0And if we can -- this is a hub of amazing textiles and they can -- and the quality of work here is superb. \xc2\xa0And if they can communicate on social media from a tech aspect, it will create the jobs here for manufacturing as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. HANNA: \xc2\xa0And I think just to kind of get at the why the emphasis on tech entrepreneurship, we fundamentally live in an \xe2\x80\x9cinnovate or die\xe2\x80\x9d world, and the pace of change is accelerating. \xc2\xa0So if we don\'t help all the region of the world keep pace with that, then in a way there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue of relevance and an ability of a society to move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, is there a hyper-efficiency that\'s ushered by technology that\'s resulting in less manual jobs -- yes. \xc2\xa0But that\'s an inevitability. \xc2\xa0So how do you help a society kind of retool and be prepared and on the forefront of that proactively rather than reactively. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My question is do we have a strategy vis-\xc3\xa0-vis China? \xc2\xa0And the U.S. overall (inaudible) conduct in diplomacy and negotiating human rights issues -- is there a cost and barriers of entry, to be able to get in? \xc2\xa0And are we trying to play catchup given China\xe2\x80\x99s investment in Africa -- there\xe2\x80\x99s already several decades (inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0I think the first wave of investment in Africa was around infrastructure. \xc2\xa0I think the next wave, which is now just breaking, is around innovation. \xc2\xa0And that where I think the United States is particularly advantaged. \xc2\xa0And trying to take some of the skill sets that have been learned not just in Silicon Valley but all around the United States and apply them to Nairobi and Legos and other emerging entrepreneurial ecosystems I think is the real opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s not to say there aren\'t continuing to be significant infrastructure needs and there aren\'t continuing needs for large corporations, GE and others to make major investments in infrastructure. \xc2\xa0But I think the next battle really is around innovation, the innovation economy and that of course supporting entrepreneurs -- they\xe2\x80\x99re starting small. \xc2\xa0And every large company starts as a small company. \xc2\xa0So these startups really are the seed corn that create the future of economies, the future of communities, the future of countries. \xc2\xa0And that\'s I think where the focus of the United States should be -- and really is with the Global Entrepreneurship Summit and this broader effort to, in a sense, encourage entrepreneurship in regions all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe helped start four or five years ago, the Case Foundation, a venture capital fund in the West Bank, for example. \xc2\xa0And the idea was if we could help create startups in Ramallah that hired a lot of different people, suddenly there would be a new narrative and there was a sense of hope and opportunity, a possibility in a region that for a lot of young people there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that sense of hope.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the economic growth will increasingly -- not just the infrastructure but the innovation, the job growth will increasingly be in innovation. \xc2\xa0But it also gives people a sense of possibility. \xc2\xa0I think people are going to be surprised by some of the things that happen in the next years in Africa, particularly in Kenya -- some iconic companies emerging onto the global stage that really will put Kenya and Africa on the map as an innovation region.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. TCHEYAN: \xc2\xa0So China is obviously -- you can look at China as a competitor. \xc2\xa0I would certainly say in Africa, if you look at a lot of the infrastructure that\'s been created (audio drop) for example, in Nigeria, South Africa, we\'re working hard at supplier development. \xc2\xa0This comes back to the job multipliers that I talked about. \xc2\xa0We\'re doing a lot on kind of training and health care, for example, that\'s going to get directly at some of the development objectives that countries have. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd these are kind of long and lasting partnerships that U.S. companies can have that are really going to enable us to participate in the growth. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, we can talk about China as a competitor, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about it, they are a competitor. \xc2\xa0But if you\'re not here, you\'re not competing. \xc2\xa0So one of our messages back -- and again, we appreciate the entrepreneurship summit and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s focus on Africa over these past years is a message to get more American companies here. \xc2\xa0Because once you are here, you start to see huge opportunities that can be developed. \xc2\xa0And then you\'re competing with China in a different way, because you\'re here and you\'re present.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I can\'t help but mention is the importance of the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization because that is -- if we don\'t have the Ex-Im Bank, that is really going to make it much tougher for us to match some of the financing that\'s available from other countries. \xc2\xa0So we\'re very hopeful that that\'s going to get through.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Just quickly because I don\'t want to take up too much time, but the President looks at this -- we welcome China in Africa. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve played a constructive role in developing infrastructure, for instance. \xc2\xa0You asked, though, about what we bring to the table. \xc2\xa0First of all, we have decades of development relationships here. \xc2\xa0If you look at where we are, we\'ve been very focused on the public health sector. \xc2\xa0We\'ve been very focused on food security. \xc2\xa0We\'ve been very focused, increasingly, on power under this President.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\'s shifting from a paradigm where we\'re essentially providing assistance to a paradigm where we\'re building capacity here in Africa. \xc2\xa0So PEPFAR is shifting to building public health systems in African countries. \xc2\xa0Our Food Security Initiative is about helping farmers bring more products to market. \xc2\xa0Power Africa, of course, is about unlocking the growth that can come with better access to electricity. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd even in other initiatives, like entrepreneurship, it\'s about empowerment of Africans to create their own growth, their own job creation, which is going to be good for us, too, because, frankly, that\'s going to end up being a market for U.S. businesses and a source for U.S. investment. \xc2\xa0Even the Young African Leaders initiative focuses very much on human capital and developing the next cadre of African leaders. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we uniquely bring to the table I think is a relationship with Africa where we\'re not just in it for a set of natural resources; we\'re here to build African capacity. \xc2\xa0And that type of partnership over the long run I think does distinguish the United States. \xc2\xa0It\'s something that we bring uniquely to bear. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd entrepreneurship, in particular, I think is an American value that is broadly respected around the world. And I think if we can tap into all the energy that\'s taking place here, that\'s going to be very good for Kenya. \xc2\xa0It\'s going to be good for other countries as well, because, again, the more growth that takes place here I think the more opportunity there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be for greater interconnection with the global economy. \xc2\xa0That includes the United States; it will include China; it will include others.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Other questions in the room?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0David Smith with the Guardian Newspaper in the UK. \xc2\xa0Do you think within the United States the perception of Africa is changing? \xc2\xa0Or is it an uphill struggle to get away from the old stereotypes about poverty and war and famine, and so on, and so that the message is that there are 54 different countries here and Africa should not be looked as a --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. TCHEYAN: \xc2\xa0My first trip to Africa was in 1980, and so I watched a lot of news, et cetera. \xc2\xa0Yes, the perception has changed tremendously. \xc2\xa0Everybody points to the economists cover, I think in the early 1990s, the \xe2\x80\x9chopeless continent,\xe2\x80\x9d early 2000s \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica rising.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Neither story is a hundred percent right. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s like any other part of the world -- there are lots of different stories.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat really impressed me over the last, say, five or six years, look who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in the airplane. \xc2\xa0Go into the business-class section. \xc2\xa0You\'re going to see businesspeople. \xc2\xa0You\'re going to see investors. \xc2\xa0You\'re going to see funds. \xc2\xa0You\'re going to see far fewer development people. \xc2\xa0And that\'s because capital is really starting to look at Africa as a destination. \xc2\xa0And people are starting to understand the difference between countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo to your point, the old story of a continent that\'s desperate, falling apart, et cetera, it\'s far more diverse. \xc2\xa0I think the richness of that diversity is coming across. \xc2\xa0I think different countries are moving at different speeds, and I think investors are seeing that. \xc2\xa0So I think it\'s a very, very different landscape there. \xc2\xa0And you just get underneath the headline stories of the media -- a lot more people are understanding what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0A couple things. \xc2\xa0First of all, I think President Kenyatta last night very eloquently, at the state dinner, talked about how Kenya is not putting out its beggar bowl, asking for donations; it\'s really putting out its hand asking for investors to invest in the future, with the idea of getting a financial return as well as helping Kenya in terms of economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the narrative of the United States is still emerging. \xc2\xa0I think a lot of people aren\'t as focused on it. \xc2\xa0There probably is a lot of recognition about the challenges and problems, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing sense of the opportunities. \xc2\xa0And that will shift over time. \xc2\xa0And this notion of the \xe2\x80\x9crise of the rest\xe2\x80\x9d we talked about really is a -- not that Silicon Valley is falling, but new regions are rising, both within the United States -- Chicago and Des Moines and Detroit and Nashville and Cincinnati and Kansas City and Madison -- there are some cities that are emerging as strong startup communities, but we\'re now seeing that happen in other parts of the world, including here in Africa -- as I mentioned, Nairobi, but many other parts of Africa.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that\'s a good thing for the world, to have a broader innovation economy and have more job creation and hope and opportunity in more places. \xc2\xa0And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing recognition in the United States that that\'s strong entrepreneurship within the country, creating jobs within the country is good, but also strong economic growth probably is the better sustainable long-term solution to deal with some of the challenges in some of these countries than just -- better to send in the entrepreneurs as opposed to sending in the military.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. HANNA: \xc2\xa0I think we\'re more receptive to that possibility than ever before for a simple reason -- that technology is proving over and over again to be a great leveler. \xc2\xa0So the parts of the world where you get leapfrog effects -- if you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happened with M-Pesa here, if you go to the Kibera slum in Nairobi, it\xe2\x80\x99s far more advanced in terms of mobile payments and mobile banking than the most privileged part of the United States. \xc2\xa0So when we see those kinds of things happening, it opens -- it causes a mindset shift and it opens our psyche. \xc2\xa0This can be as vital a place as Silicon Valley, in many ways.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go now to the press filing center to see if there are questions there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mike Dorning, Bloomberg News. \xc2\xa0A short question for Mr. Case. \xc2\xa0You mentioned at the top of the briefing that there\xe2\x80\x99s a quite vibrant startup community in Nairobi, and that you expect several to go public in the next several years for a billion-dollar valuation. \xc2\xa0How many startups has Revolution LLC invested in? \xc2\xa0And how much money has Revolution LLC put into Kenya? \xc2\xa0And can you give us a sense of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve actually invested in, which kinds of companies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s really kind of three parts to this. \xc2\xa0Revolution is an investment company, both a venture fund and a growth fund. \xc2\xa0The Case Foundation also makes investments, not just philanthropic investments, but sometimes financial investments. \xc2\xa0And Jean and I also make a series of personal investments.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in the last year, I think we made a half-dozen investments in this area, both in terms of helping launch some funds. \xc2\xa0One we launched yesterday, called Village Capital. \xc2\xa0Last month, the Africa Angels Network. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also invested in the Endeavor Catalyst Fund and some others that then use that capital and invest in dozens of entrepreneurs all across Africa. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also made a handful of investments here in Nairobi at one company called BRCK that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on energy, and another is Sanergy, which is focused on sanitation. \xc2\xa0And just a couple days ago, we had a pitch competition, as I mentioned at the iHub, and eight companies pitched and the winner was OJ Green (ph), and we made an investment in them.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to make additional investments. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re looking to tell a story around the United States and around the world of what the opportunity is in Africa. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to try to take this idea of entrepreneurship and globalize it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one last point -- it came up yesterday in discussions with the President, that he launched and asked me to chair four or five years ago an initiative called Startup America, the Startup America Partnership. \xc2\xa0That was designed to build regional entrepreneurship, to lift up regions within the United States and create the ecosystems there with more focus on capital, including the JOBS Act that passed the Congress and the President signed into law about three years ago, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. \xc2\xa0But it also inspired lots of other countries and so forth. \xc2\xa0Sixty countries have basically emulated the Startup America idea. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that shows the power of the President of the United States talking about entrepreneurship and creating something called the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, and really inspiring countries all around the world to focus on the future, lean into the future, and bet on innovators, bet on entrepreneurs, and encourage more investors to fuel those dreams, which ultimately then fuels the job creation and economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Excellent. \xc2\xa0Are there additional questions from the press filing center?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How much money have you managed -- have you put into Kenya? \xc2\xa0And how many total companies have you invested in, in Kenya?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CASE: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check. \xc2\xa0I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s a handful of companies. \xc2\xa0Our main focus is the United States. \xc2\xa0The Case Foundation has really been taking the lead on some of these investments. \xc2\xa0A handful of companies and millions of dollars. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the exact number is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Anyone else at the press filing center?</p>\n<p>\n\tWell, thank you for spending your money with us. \xc2\xa0We certainly appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen and I will stick around and spend a little bit of additional time taking other questions that you may have on the trip, or other questions that may be on your mind this morning. \xc2\xa0So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we start with the presidential pool. \xc2\xa0I know that you guys have to drop off shortly. \xc2\xa0So are there questions from the pool that we can handle first?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s the pool here. \xc2\xa0We just have a non-Africa question on the situation in Turkey, in what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in northern Iraq right now. \xc2\xa0Do you guys have any response? \xc2\xa0And is it concerning to you at all, given that the Kurds have been pretty effective in helping you guys go after Islamic State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me turn it over to Ben to take that one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Thanks, Julie. \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been touch with the Turks for a significant amount of time in discussing the shared threat that we face from ISIL. \xc2\xa0We also, again, have sent our condolences to the Turkish people for a number of terrorist attacks that have taken place there recently. \xc2\xa0And you have seen, of course, much more assertive Turkish action in both Syria and Iraq in recent days. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d say, Julie, is that we welcome Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s increased focus and accelerated efforts against ISIL. \xc2\xa0We are certainly mindful of the fact that we encourage our different partners in this fight to work together, and we obviously have a good working relationship with the regional Kurdish government in northern Iraq. \xc2\xa0And so those lines of communication are open.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the U.S. of course recognizes the PKK, specifically, as a terrorist organization. \xc2\xa0So again, Turkey has a right to take action related to terrorist targets. \xc2\xa0And we certainly appreciate their interest in accelerating efforts against ISIL. \xc2\xa0We will be in continued contact with them in the days to come. \xc2\xa0And I think, frankly, where this really can lead towards is a more -- even broader and more effective effort to degrade the ISIL safe haven across northern Syria and northern Iraq. \xc2\xa0Turkey can play an important role in those efforts. \xc2\xa0At the same time, of course, they will be working with a variety of partners on the ground to push ISIL out of those areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Other questions from the pool?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, guys, it\xe2\x80\x99s Margaret. \xc2\xa0Can you also just quickly walk us through what to expect from the President this morning? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give a broad overview of what to expect in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today. \xc2\xa0This is obviously a very meaningful trip for him to come back to Kenya and to come as the first President of the United States to visit Kenya.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him today is a very thematic address to the Kenyan people. \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to step back and put into context the extraordinary progress that Kenya has made over the last decade, and also noting some of the extraordinary challenges that have confronted Kenya over the last decade -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s corruption, which he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken about frequently, of course; or the incidents of ethnic violence that pose such a threat to the country, but ultimately were rejected by the Kenyan people over the last several years.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him speak personally about how he views Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s progress, how that connects to his own story. \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak about a number of different issues that are important to Kenya. \xc2\xa0That would include the effort to continue to make progress towards a strong, sustainable democratic government that deals with issues like corruption, which he\xe2\x80\x99s touched upon in his visits here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99ll want to talk about the need for a broad and an inclusive opportunity for the Kenyan people. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen great strides made in bringing economic growth to Kenya. \xc2\xa0The President will be reinforcing the need to ensure that that includes access to opportunity for women and girls in Kenya, as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to the need for a continued focus on national unity and reconciliation inside of Kenya, coming out of the difficult period of 2008. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a great with a new constitution for Kenyans to move together as one nation. \xc2\xa0And so the President will speak to the importance of keeping that progress going forward. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, of course, as Kenya deals with the threat of terrorism, he will certainly express our unwavering support for Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s counterterrorism efforts. \xc2\xa0I think he will also be reinforcing what you heard him say yesterday -- that commitment to human rights and the rule of law is an important part of how we, in the long term, are able to defeat terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut generally speaking, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President speak very personally about what Kenya means to him, what Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s progress means to him, the opportunity that exists for Kenya. \xc2\xa0And if I were to distill it, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be saying that Kenya is at a moment now where there\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary promise for Kenya to make additional leaps forward in terms of its democratic governance and its economy, but there\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinary peril as well -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s threats, like terrorism, or issues like corruption, or the need to provide inclusive opportunity in the country. \xc2\xa0And he will be I think speaking to what that path of progress looks like for Kenya, and of course expressing the interest of the United States in being a partner in that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Other questions from the pool? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tie together this stop in Kenya with the stop in Ethiopia, and look ahead a little bit? \xc2\xa0And lay out what your goals are in going to Ethiopia, and how confrontational the President plans to be on human rights issues there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very common thread between Kenya and Ethiopia. \xc2\xa0These are two very large, very fast-growing economies in East Africa that are also very important counterterrorism partners for the United States. \xc2\xa0So a lot of the same issues that we focused on here -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s promoting additional economic growth, and trade and investment with the United States, or whether that\xe2\x80\x99s deepening our security cooperation in the effort against al-Shabaab -- those will be on the agenda in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe see this region taking off. \xc2\xa0East Africa is on the move. \xc2\xa0It is going to become an increasing destination for U.S. investment and an increasing market for U.S. goods. \xc2\xa0But there are very real security challenges that have to be dealt with, and the President will speak to those.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also will be I think speaking to the signature development initiatives that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing in cooperation with both Kenya and Ethiopia and other countries. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about food and power and health and young people and entrepreneurship. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut also, two other points that I think that are important to note for Ethiopia -- he will be convening a meeting that is focused on the situation in South Sudan with a number of regional leaders, including President Kenyatta and President Museveni of Uganda, as well as the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, to discuss what we can do together to try to bring an end to horrific civil conflict in South Sudan. \xc2\xa0So that regional issue will, I think, be a focus in Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then he\xe2\x80\x99ll speaking at the African Union. \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s important here is that gives you a platform to speak to the entire continent. \xc2\xa0This is the premier organization for Africa cooperation. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that last year we did the first-ever heads of state -- heads of government summit in Washington, with all of the leaders from Africa. \xc2\xa0That was an African Union summit, again, with all of the members of the African Union -- except for a number who we have significant differences with, of course -- invited to a Washington for a summit with the President. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on that coming to the AU, I think signals that we are elevating our engagement with the African Union, both the institution itself and the continent as a whole. \xc2\xa0So in his African Union address, I think he will speak to his Africa policy of what he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to accomplish, the legacy he\xe2\x80\x99d like to leave behind, and what the United States and Africa need to be focused on, working together. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn human rights, this will certainly be a focal point of discussions, along with the other issues I addressed. \xc2\xa0The Ethiopian government has made extraordinary progress in bringing greater development and opportunity to its citizens, but there are very significant restrictions that are not consistent with the universal values that we stand up for; for instance, the need for a free press. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too much intimidation, and even imprisonment of journalists, and the need for a viable space for civil society and political opposition in the country. \xc2\xa0So the President will be certainly raising issues related to human rights in Ethiopia, just as he did here in Kenya.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the main message that people I think need to take away from the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ve just had with the entrepreneurs, too, is that East Africa is a region that is going to be of growing importance to the United States going forward, both because of the opportunities it presents and because of some ongoing challenges we have to address.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take one more from the pool, if there\xe2\x80\x99s one more question from the pool?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hey, Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99re good. \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you, guys. \xc2\xa0All right, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we do a few in the room? \xc2\xa0Yes, sir, in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President talked about Burundi yesterday. \xc2\xa0He said the elections were not credible, and he encouraged the government and the opposition to go to the negotiating table. \xc2\xa0The thing is, President Pierre Nkurunziza says that he got elected and that the poll was credible. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely that he will accept to go to the negotiating table because he believes he won. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been ignoring called by the AU, by the East Africa community. \xc2\xa0So the question now is what to do, and whether President Obama will discuss this when he meets with Prime Minister Desalegn in Addis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes, he will certainly discuss the situation in Burundi with Mrs. Zuma when he\xe2\x80\x99s at the AU. \xc2\xa0I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very concerned about the unfolding situation. \xc2\xa0It is certainly the case that the President of Burundi will claim, and has claimed, victory in the election. \xc2\xa0But the fact of the matter is, so many components of the process were illegitimate that we cannot accept the legitimacy of the result. \xc2\xa0You have a President who extended his own term over the objections of Burundi\xe2\x80\x99s own laws and man of the people of Burundi. \xc2\xa0You had an opposition that did not compete in the election. \xc2\xa0And you have a result, therefore, that is not broadly accepted inside the country. \xc2\xa0And if the result is not broadly accepted inside of Burundi, it risks an unstable situation going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo as the President said, we are going to continue to encourage the President to sit down with the opposition and have a dialogue about how to move forward and how to have a more legitimate political process that can produce a result that has the confidence not just of the international community but of the people of Burundi.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think even with the challenges that you cite, the important point here in the coming days is to ensure that there is a unified voice in the international community. \xc2\xa0That includes here in the region with the different neighbors. \xc2\xa0That includes the African Union. \xc2\xa0That includes our international partners. \xc2\xa0Too much, in the past, I think sometimes there has been an acceptance of non-democratic results or efforts to extend terms in office. \xc2\xa0I think if we are very clear and firm that this result is not going to lead to the most stable and democratic outcome for Burundi, and that there does need to be a process of dialogue, that is our best option to try to get the parties to the table in a way that can yield the best result for the people of Burundi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) feel that the President has sway with African leaders to point them in the direction that you would want them to go? \xc2\xa0And do you think that is helped by his own roots?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, Isaac. \xc2\xa0I guess the way I\xe2\x80\x99d put it is, first of all, the United States has significant relationships in Africa with many countries -- security relationships, development relationships, and increasingly trade and investment relationships. \xc2\xa0So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an interest in Africa in deepening cooperation with the United States, and that was certainly evident at the summit the President had last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think speaking of the President personally, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition, broadly, that he has a unique understanding of the African continent for a President of the United States, given his roots here and given the focus that he\xe2\x80\x99s put on this over many years. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s also, frankly, extraordinarily popular across the African continent. \xc2\xa0He is someone who is broadly respected by not just the leaders, but the peoples of these countries, especially young populations who make up an increasing percentage of these countries. \xc2\xa0So, for that reason, I think people pay close attention to what he has to say. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to agree with everything he says, but I think he can lay out, I think, a direction that he thinks the U.S.-African partnership can go in. \xc2\xa0And I think he can also speak uniquely to the types of steps that can be taken to bring greater prosperity, opportunity, and democratic governance to African countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 Do you guys feel a special responsibility toward the situation in (inaudible) given the administration\xe2\x80\x99s history with South Sudan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the case. \xc2\xa0And look, the United States of America, broadly, I think has a special responsibility. \xc2\xa0The Bush administration did very good work in terms of developing a comprehensive agreement between North and South Sudan that led to the scheduling of a referendum. \xc2\xa0We did extraordinary amounts of work in the early years of the administration to make sure that that referendum could go off peacefully and that you could have South Sudanese choosing an independent course. \xc2\xa0And the fact that this has now spiraled into a civil conflict I think does call upon the United States to play a unique role. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a huge assistance relationship with South Sudan, and we have a history with South Sudan. \xc2\xa0And what I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused on is how can we not impose a solution from the United States, but work with some of the other countries in the region who share our concerns -- Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya -- to try to find a way out of this impasse that is not going to be anything but more humanitarian suffering for the people of South Sudan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes, I think we feel deeply invested in the success of South Sudan. \xc2\xa0And I think, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the President, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the commitment made by the United States. \xc2\xa0You have bipartisan support in Congress over many years for the people of South Sudan. \xc2\xa0I think the tragedy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that there was this very long struggle for independence that ultimately drew our support. \xc2\xa0But once independence was claimed, the ability to transition from being a movement that sought independence to governing the country of South Sudan, that transition did not work for the simple reason that you have a country with enormous needs. \xc2\xa0I mean, if you look at South Sudan at the moment of independence, if you look at their infrastructure, if you look at their capacity to promote stable growth, they were very far behind the curve. \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s transpired is leaders competing over limited resources, competing over power in ways that don\xe2\x80\x99t serve their people. \xc2\xa0And I think we do want to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re stepping up to the plate and doing everything we can</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, you can\xe2\x80\x99t fix everything in a country that has been so torn by conflict for so many decades, but I think we have an obligation to try to bring the parties to a better place and to give the people of South Sudan an opportunity for peace.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ben, did the President essentially have to overlook his concerns with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here in Kenya and what is going on in Ethiopia to make this trip? \xc2\xa0And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it send sort of a mixes message where he\xe2\x80\x99s criticizing Kenya on issues like gay rights and on corruption, yet he\xe2\x80\x99s raising the glass and toasting these very leaders later on that evening? \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there kind of a mixed message there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0Look, we go to China and nobody asks us whether or not we should be going to China, even though we have very significant differences with that government, and we raise those differences. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, if we only went to countries around the world who agreed with us about everything, we\xe2\x80\x99d have a very short travel itinerary. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, if you look at Kenya, there\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous amount of space that we share in common in terms of our commitment to economic progress, our support for an evolving commitment to not just the democracy that Kenyans have, but stronger, more transparent democratic institutions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Kenyatta was very forward-leaning in the meeting yesterday and in his public comments in saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- he is making a renewed commitment to combat corruption in Kenya, which has been an anchor on growth here for so long. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we made progress on a number of issues we care about in terms of our security cooperation against al-Shabaab, where the President also was met with agreement from President Kenyatta that a robust counterterrorism effort also has to include a commitment to the rule of law and human rights. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working with the Kenyans on. \xc2\xa0And our Security Governance Initiative looks across the whole approach to fighting terrorism. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about providing military assistance; it\xe2\x80\x99s about developing approaches that will last and succeed in the long run.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had good progress on discussions around corruption. \xc2\xa0Very good progress on the trade and investment space where we see Kenya taking off. \xc2\xa0But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re going to agree on everything. \xc2\xa0And if you look at the record of Kenya on LGBT rights, unfortunately it mirrors the record in many countries in this part of the world. \xc2\xa0And where we see those differences, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be very direct and candid about them. \xc2\xa0I think President Kenyatta fully expected that because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has done everywhere he\xe2\x80\x99s gone in Africa where there have been these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason to not engage. \xc2\xa0In fact, being here and engaging on these issues ultimately, we believe, is going to advance not just our interests but our values. \xc2\xa0And again, I think you saw that on some of the issues discussed yesterday with President Kenyatta, even on LGBT rights, clearly they remain in a different place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Josh, just before this mass shooting in Louisiana, the President made those comments to the BBC, saying that this was perhaps the greatest frustration of his presidency, stopping these mass shootings from occurring. \xc2\xa0Is it possible that this latest one has changed his calculus on trying to pursue some sort of gun control legislation up on Capitol Hill? \xc2\xa0I mean, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the lingering question. \xc2\xa0And have you had a chance to speak to him about the fact that he made these comments to the BBC and then a couple hours later, or maybe sooner than that, another mass shooting occurred?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s calculus has always been that there are important common-sense steps that Congress can take to prevent individuals that have a criminal background, that have documented mental problems or other reasons that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to obtain a firearm, take those steps and implement those policies in a way that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s calculus about the need for that legislation has not changed. \xc2\xa0What we will need to see is we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to see Congress change their calculus in terms of their willingness to take those steps. \xc2\xa0And the President has articulated his view that that calculus will change once the American public makes clear that this issue is a priority, and that it is a priority on which a substantial number of Americans will base their vote for Congress. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what will be required before we see Congress begin to take those steps. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think, in the mind of the President, the reason that he has expressed so much frustration about this is that there are tangible and tragic consequences for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s continued failure to take these steps. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t just have in mind the high-profile mass shooting incidents that occur all too often; the President also has in mind the much more frequent and therefore much less newsworthy shooting events that take place in many large cities all across the country, every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no piece of legislation that Congress could pass that would eliminate every act of gun violence, but there certainly are some common-sense things that we could do that surely would have the impact of reducing the number of those incidents. \xc2\xa0And those are steps that could be taken without undermining the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0And it is the source of the President\xe2\x80\x99s frustration, as he himself has expressed, that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken those steps, despite the clear need to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On corruption, I think the President has mentioned the issue of corruption at all of his appearances. \xc2\xa0But what concretely can he do? \xc2\xa0I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure also the Kenyan authorities have said that they will rein in corruption. \xc2\xa0But what actually can the United States do? \xc2\xa0And also, I want to ask you about the choice of this venue. \xc2\xa0A little over a year ago, this place was synonymous with a roundup of Somalis from Eastleigh. \xc2\xa0They had to bribe their way out to get out of this place. \xc2\xa0Is the President aware of that? \xc2\xa0And what are we to read into the choice of this as the venue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly aware of it. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, in his discussions yesterday with President Kenyatta, in his public comments yesterday and in his speech today, he will make very clear that efforts to combat terrorism cannot lead to the stigmatizing of whole populations. \xc2\xa0That ultimately, Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim minority, like America\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim minority, is fundamentally a part of our countries, and frankly, our best allies in the effort against extremism.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him speak again today to the fact that while it is certainly the case that we have to be vigilant against terrorism and we have to take action against terrorist networks, that we have to do so in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the rule of law and upholding human rights, and frankly, respecting the extraordinary contributions and value of Muslim minority populations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think that informs how the President thinks and talks about these issues. \xc2\xa0And I think you had an acknowledgement from President Kenyatta yesterday that this is a new threat to them, in some respects, and the types that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent years, and that they do need to focus on upholding the rule of law and human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, our assistance in this space looks across the Kenyan security sector so that we\xe2\x80\x99re not just helping them identify terrorist targets, we\xe2\x80\x99re helping them develop approaches that will work in countering terrorism. \xc2\xa0And, for instance, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a partnership between the Massachusetts National Guard and the Kenyan Security Forces, too, to think through ways in which they address security challenges that are respectful of the rule of law.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn corruption, in terms -- and let me just begin I think with what the Kenyan government needs to do in the eyes of President Obama. \xc2\xa0First of all, it takes a commitment from the top to make this an issue and to root out corruption, but it also will take a commitment from Kenyan society as a whole. \xc2\xa0I think the types of steps that would be effective would include the types of laws and initiatives that have been launched by President Kenyatta, but also the need for high-profile prosecutions of individuals who are found guilty of corruption charges to send a message that nobody is immune to the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there needs to be a broader commitment to transparency and governance, and there needs to be a role for civil society. \xc2\xa0And one of the reasons the President is going to meet with civil society later, and that he has spoken about civil society on this trip, is that they help you deal with challenges like corruption because they can serve as a check. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve in Kenya, for instance, civil society play an important role in spotting incidents of ethnic violence in the run-up to the election, and getting ahead of that and reporting that out so that action could be taken. \xc2\xa0And I think, similarly, civil society has a role to play in terms of anti-corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the U.S. support to those efforts, we have our own experience with combatting corruption not just in the United States, but helping different countries and around the world develop tools and legal avenues for rooting out corruption. \xc2\xa0So we have a lot of expertise and technical capacity that we can share with the Kenyans. \xc2\xa0We have tremendous investment in Kenya through many different programs. \xc2\xa0And I think making transparency a part of how we do business with Kenya, that in and of itself is a part of setting that tone.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we can certainly help, but ultimately the will has to come from the Kenyan government. \xc2\xa0So we can provide all sorts of technical assistance, advice, experience from our experience; we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that in different parts of Africa in terms of helping to develop judicial sectors that take this on, and policing that can get at corruption. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, the decision has to be made collectively by the Kenyan people and their government.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d also encourage you to take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit yesterday, where he talked about how in many communities corruption actually can be a significant barrier to entry for a lot of entrepreneurs that are looking to establish a business. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a clear economic incentive for countries to start to take those steps that root out corruption.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Sorry, one more thing is, the entrepreneurship thing reminds me -- the other thing that we can, frankly, do is our support for entrepreneurship I think helps promote tools that have proven valuable in finding ways around corruption. \xc2\xa0So when you look at mobile banking, for instance, that can bypass more corrupt forms of doing business in the past. \xc2\xa0If you look at -- tech came up earlier. \xc2\xa0If you look at what Kenyans are trying to do with technology, often it involves them empowering themselves with respect to the delivery of basic services or their ability to do business with people in other parts of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo entrepreneurship can actually have a secondary effect beyond economic growth in terms of creating new systems that don\xe2\x80\x99t have the corruption that is embedded in some of the old systems.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For the Italian workers that have been recently kidnapped in Libya, have you gotten to address the issue of Libya in the African Union meetings? \xc2\xa0And do you still think the mediation by the U.N. envoy, Le\xc3\xb3n, is the best option?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0We still think that mediation by the U.N. envoy is the best option. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some progress in those discussions. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been growing recognition from some of the factions within Libya that there needs to be a political accommodation. \xc2\xa0Frankly, the threat emerging from groups like ISIL has helped catalyze attention around the need for greater cooperation and political accommodation within Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the African Union, I think it will likely be a topic of discussion. \xc2\xa0You certainly have a number of African countries who are dealing with threats that they believe are emanating from Libya, if you look at Chad and Niger and others. \xc2\xa0I think in terms of the terrorism threat that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused the most principally, it will be al-Shabaab just because we\xe2\x80\x99re in East Africa and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to Ethiopia in terms of our bilateral discussions. \xc2\xa0And al-Shabaab is really the focal point here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will rise to that same level, but I think when we look across the African continent, engage the African Union, we certainly see the need to address the challenge in Libya as part of that agenda. \xc2\xa0And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s both because of the situation in Libya and because of the spillover effects into neighboring states, as well as Italy, of course, which has tragically had those people taken, and also has had to contend with significant migration flows.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0David -- the Guardian. \xc2\xa0Couple of quick factual things. \xc2\xa0Do we know how many people are going to be here today? \xc2\xa0And do they include the general public, or some special invitation list? \xc2\xa0And secondly, just going back to the African Union, there are starting to be many African heads of state -- because I was wondering, Robert Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe who, when he holds the rotating chair of the African Union, he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing a huge amount of traveling this year; I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he would not have missed this opportunity for the world. \xc2\xa0Can you confirms he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be there? \xc2\xa0And if so, was he effectively told to stay away?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, with respect to the African Union, we do not expect Robert Mugabe to be there. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is, when we had this summit in the United States last year, he was one of the leaders that we did not invite given our current sanctions on him and the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken to governing his country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is not a head-of-state summit at the African Union. \xc2\xa0We did not seek to have a head-of-state summit at the African Union. \xc2\xa0So the only heads of state that we\xe2\x80\x99re planning to meet with and have come to Addis are the ones who are participating in South Sudan meetings. \xc2\xa0So that would be President Museveni, President Kenyatta, along with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia and President Obama.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour first question was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to the number. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the neighborhood of 5,000. \xc2\xa0But in terms of who is invited, we made an effort to prioritize the invitation to young people, so young people from different universities and programs across Nairobi. \xc2\xa0So our embassy, as it does with many of these speeches, works with the venue to build an audience. \xc2\xa0And the priority here was on bringing young people in. \xc2\xa0There will certainly be a number of government officials and leading members of Kenyan society. \xc2\xa0But I think the broad majority of the audience will be comprised of younger Kenyans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He was asked this question yesterday by a Kenyan journalist, about his plans for Africa -- or Kenya -- legacy question and in his post-presidency. \xc2\xa0Do you have something more concrete? \xc2\xa0He gave a very general answer. \xc2\xa0Obviously he has family ties, but does he have something ambitious in mind, like (inaudible) or CGI? \xc2\xa0Does he have something? \xc2\xa0Can you share something?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t really go beyond -- that far beyond what he said, frankly because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that those plans have been fleshed out. \xc2\xa0What I do know is that two areas of particular focus I think that he would like to continue working on would include the outreach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to young leaders across Africa and here in Kenya, and this issue of entrepreneurship and promoting entrepreneurship. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the President has gotten a lot of satisfaction out of seeing how the Young African Leaders Initiative and the Global Entrepreneurship Summit process have galvanized young people in Kenya. \xc2\xa0And it kind of speaks to, I think, going all the way back to how the President began his career in public life, which was, as someone who sought to organize people around a progress agenda, I think he sees a lot that can be done in terms of bringing people together and promoting youth empowerment and entrepreneurship. \xc2\xa0So those are certainly two areas that he touched on that I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll carry forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as you said, when he\xe2\x80\x99s a private citizen, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be able to do things are particularly Kenya-specific that you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do as President of the United States. \xc2\xa0As President, his focus has been on we have a very large security relationship, health relationship, development relationship with Kenya. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s sought to help aid Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s progress through those efforts and through his own commitment to a set of issues here in Kenya. \xc2\xa0But I think as a private citizen, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to focus I think more specifically on Kenya in ways that he\xe2\x80\x99s been constrained from doing as President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Lesley, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I give you the last one in the room and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the press filing center.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was hoping you could give us a little bit more on the efforts to help Kenyan security (inaudible)? \xc2\xa0And also, a couple of environmental groups called for outright ban on commercial sales of ivory. \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the stakeholders in terms of combatting wildlife trafficking. \xc2\xa0I think our view is that we pushed this as far as we absolutely could in terms of banning the trade of ivory to the United States. \xc2\xa0So again, I think in the past -- and we can get you some more detail -- in the past, I think it gets difficult when you all the way down to the fact that there are existing products that have ivory as a part of them. \xc2\xa0And being able to place a universal ban on anything involving ivory is extraordinarily difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think our sense and our objective here was to do as much as we possibly could with this new rule. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to also bring attention to this globally so that we\xe2\x80\x99re leading by example in trying to bring other countries with us, because we see huge problems with demand in Asia specifically. \xc2\xa0And what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to do is try to set a standard that we can try to bring other countries, particularly in Asia, towards.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to the security assistance, so we launched last year at the African Leaders Summit this Security Governance Initiative, which focuses on a number of countries; one is Kenya. \xc2\xa0What we worked through with them yesterday was a plan, moving forward, for us to engage in a numbers ways. \xc2\xa0And that includes sharing of intelligence. \xc2\xa0That includes the coordination with respect to our own efforts against al-Shabaab, and Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0But it also includes looking at what type of training is being done, what type of capabilities do Kenyan security forces have, what type of training do they have as it relates to following the rule of law, and how can they respond to attacks and root out safe havens here inside of Kenya in ways that are effective but also don\xe2\x80\x99t run contrary to our values.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99d describe it broadly as a capacity-building effort that looks at everything from what type of equipment they have, to what type of leadership they\xe2\x80\x99re bringing to bear, to what type of protocols that they\xe2\x80\x99re following in terms of their efforts against terrorism. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at increasing funding for that effort. \xc2\xa0One area, for instance, is the Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund that we initiated last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Massachusetts National Guard -- what we often do is, look, we have counterterrorism forces who work here in the region. \xc2\xa0But often, local security force or National Guard forces have more experience with policing or responding to events, and so they can come and share that experience and kind of develop planning mechanism for a local security force to think through what do they do to respond terrorist attack, what do they do to respond to an incident; how are we organized, how could they learn from that experience.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of close work with the Kenyans in recent years because of their effort in AMISOM. \xc2\xa0We obviously have counterterrorism platforms in Somalia. \xc2\xa0We use direct action, including drone strikes in Somalia. \xc2\xa0So, at the same time, AMISOM has been the force on the ground that has been pushing back and displacing al-Shabaab from many of the areas that they claim. \xc2\xa0So this is already a close relationship, but what we\xe2\x80\x99re now doing is looking across the sector at ways that Kenya can be most effective in combatting a threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take two from the press filing center, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll wrap it up here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We keep talking about human rights. \xc2\xa0But in the President Kenyatta\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday, he seemed to be acknowledging that, even at the very least, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be treated equally under the law here. \xc2\xa0How did the President react to that? \xc2\xa0Was he surprised by that? \xc2\xa0And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that an impediment to expanding human rights here broadly? \xc2\xa0And secondly, why do you see the last election in Ethiopia as legitimate if they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing as a 100 percent vote?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0On the first question, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President was surprised at all, unfortunately, because frankly we just have not seen a commitment to take up this issue in many parts of this region. \xc2\xa0Frankly, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of our time doing in recent years is trying to avert worse outcomes, like the passing of laws that criminalize behavior as we saw in Uganda, for instance. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we had any expectation that the government of Kenya would take a different position.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, the LGBT community here faces extraordinary challenges. \xc2\xa0And what we can do is, frankly, keep a spotlight on their rights, raise this issue, and make sure that governments know that they\xe2\x80\x99re are going to be hearing about this from us and from, hopefully, our partners in the international community, just at the same time as I think the activist community here will be figuring out what the best way forward is in terms of pursuing greater rights and dignity.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is going to be long-term process. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects transformation overnight, even if that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to happen, on LGBT issues. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, we want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re raising everywhere we go where we see these challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat does not mean that you can\xe2\x80\x99t make progress on other human rights issues. \xc2\xa0And I think we have had good discussions here related to human rights with respect to how counterterrorism policies are implemented, in terms of how civil society is treated. \xc2\xa0And the President will be meeting later today with a very broad group of civil society actors here in Kenya to lift up their role as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact of the matter is, at any given time, if you look across the spectrum of human rights issues, there is a grave concern, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to try to make as much progress as you can on the other areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd frankly, the last one that\xe2\x80\x99s worth citing here is simply a commitment to keep moving forward with the implementation of the Kenyan constitution in 2010, because the ethnic violence that took place in 2008 certainly posed a grave threat to democracy here in Kenya. \xc2\xa0And so just the continued, sustained work of implementing what is one of the most progressive constitutions in Africa as it relates to political rights I think would be very important for human rights here in Africa -- in Kenya, but also in setting an example for East Africa. \xc2\xa0Because if Kenya is moving forward with deepening its democracy, \xc2\xa0ultimately, given its role in East Africa, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to send a message across the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to Ethiopia, clearly an election that has 100 percent is not one that enjoys the broad support and legitimacy that a free and transparent election would have. \xc2\xa0So I think we would certainly differentiate the outcome from what we would term more free, fair and competitive elections. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is, we have a broad set of interests with the Ethiopian government that includes a commitment to raise these issues, because ultimately we believe that democracies are going to be more successful if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at promoting economic growth, economic dynamism, in combatting security threats. \xc2\xa0Democracies are more resilient in dealing with those issues because they can draw on all of their peoples.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be exploring ways in which we can support greater political space for Ethiopians, and support dialogue between opposition and the government in Ethiopia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll do one last question from the press filing center.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A quick question on things going on elsewhere in the world. \xc2\xa0Ayatollah Khamenei\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter posted a graphic, depicting the President with a gun to his head. \xc2\xa0I wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this and have any reaction. \xc2\xa0And also, whether you have any reaction to Israeli police entering the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0So, on your second question, I have not seen the report. \xc2\xa0I would have to obviously look at that. \xc2\xa0It would be an extraordinarily sensitive issue. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take that back.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn your first question, look, the Supreme Leader says many things that we find completely objectionable. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to -- well, let me put it this way. \xc2\xa0This is of a pattern of things that give us very serious concern about the Iranian government, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s their support for terrorism, their threats to Israel and the United States, or outrageous statements or images that may emanate from the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, one of the reasons we\xe2\x80\x99re so focused on ensuring that we implement what is a very good deal with respect to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is that we believe that that would pose the gravest danger to the United States and the rest of the world; that precisely because we have such differences with this government, that they cannot be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And we have a diplomatic pathway to achieving that objective. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to erase our differences with the Iranian government. \xc2\xa0What it is going to do is resolve what is the greatest potential threat and the greatest challenge to the international community, which is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:05 A.M.
