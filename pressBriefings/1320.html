GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ms. Werner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about these reports of the spy swap that apparently is being arranged?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are -- this is, as we\'ve said earlier, a law enforcement matter that is being handled that way, and I would refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is talking.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is declining comment.\xc2\xa0 Why should you?\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s find -- you be the first one to talk.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\'t want to be a trend-setter, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually the stuff is out there.\xc2\xa0 The guy -- the brother of one of the people being held in the Soviet -- I\'m sorry -- Russia -- excuse me -- said that he saw a list of 11 people who were about to be exchanged --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a trend-setter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Again, Bill, I appreciate the question, I just don\'t have anything to add at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask a question about the oil spill, which is whether the White House has any concerns about the fact that BP evidently has many government contracts, particularly with the Defense Department, that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a lot of money from?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything specifically on that.\xc2\xa0 I would -- I can see about some of the defense contracts.\xc2\xa0 I know different agencies are reviewing different things as it relates to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously our focus at the moment with BP is to ensure that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that they can.\xc2\xa0 Obviously weather has, over the past several days, complicated our efforts to introduce additional containment vessels -- the Helix is a device that was -- its date has been pushed back in terms of additional containment capacity, as the Enterprise and the Q4000 continue to average above 20,000 barrels of oil a day accumulating in from the leaking well.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything, though, on the additional --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with BP benefitting from taxpayer money in these contracts --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to look at the specific contracts to see when they were let, to see what the job was for.\xc2\xa0 Obviously our focus is on ensuring at the moment in the Gulf that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing each and everything that we believe must be done to plug the well and to contain what is leaking from the well, and ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99ll be responsible for environmental damages to the surrounding environment caused by the oil spill.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On trade, the President said today that he was committing to submitting the free trade agreements with Panama and Colombia to Congress as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timeline on that?\xc2\xa0 And given his commitment on South Korea, why not aim for the goal of ironing out any other sort of outstanding concerns on Colombia and Panama with Congress by November so all three can be submitted to Congress in early 2011?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to jump ahead on the timeline, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s November or January or what have you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously you heard the President -- what the President had to say about exports and about Colombia and Panama.\xc2\xa0 You heard what the President said in Toronto about South Korea, that there are outstanding issues that we see that we believe can and should be resolved prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Seoul in November in hopes of bringing something to the Congress on South Korea early next year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow, Robert?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come around.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It certainly appears that unemployment is going to be a problem for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And given that, I was wondering why should unemployment insurance extensions be considered emergency as opposed to being paid for, given that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be facing this problem likely for several more years?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we face an emergency situation in the sense that we are dealing, Jake, with long-term unemployed like we\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen -- my guess is likely since the last Depression.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact figure with me, but I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve entered into an era of that long-term unemployment that is dire and severe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as a result of this recession -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the facts, the figures with me, but we see this is also not your typical recession in terms of the fact that you do have higher-skilled, college-educated workers facing employment prospects that are worse than you would see, say, in previous recessions in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s or even in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is an emergency situation because those that are losing their jobs are out of work for a far longer period of time than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my point -- why not budget for that?\xc2\xa0 Why not -- since the President supports pay-as-you-go, why not have --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, because I think this is a unique emergency that we believe should be addressed immediately.\xc2\xa0 We understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re giving insurance and benefits to those that have lost their jobs.\xc2\xa0 These are people that are -- because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have income -- are using what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting from their benefits to pay their rent, to take care of their average household expenses.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re using that money and putting it back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 It makes sense certainly for the workers and it makes sense for your economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but you\'re not answering my question, why not budget for it given that this is going to be a problem for several years?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jake, our viewpoint is just that it\xe2\x80\x99s a unique emergency and should be treated as such.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Philosophically, do you think that -- well, there\xe2\x80\x99s this debate that\xe2\x80\x99s emerged within the Republican Party, given voice by Sharron Angle in Nevada and Rand Paul in Kentucky, that perhaps unemployment benefits constantly being extended discourages people from going out and getting work?\xc2\xa0 I recognize that\xe2\x80\x99s not supported by a lot of economists.\xc2\xa0 But is there a limit to how long people should be able to be on unemployment insurance?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- I think you can establish some -- look, we don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it as something that is done on a permanent basis, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, should -- I mean, is two years, three years, four years?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Recovery Act extended it through -- I\'d have to look up what the exact number is that the Recovery Act extended it through.\xc2\xa0 But, Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly any -- there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no economic research that if\xc2\xa0 -- that in a situation where I think there are five applicants for every job, that people are somehow sitting at home on the sidelines, not hoping to gain long-term employment but to gain temporary benefits that obviously are never going to replace the amount of -- are certainly not likely in any way to replace the type of income that one was getting as a salaried or even an hourly wage employee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those arguments.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I shudder to think -- my guess is that people that would make that argument, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met anybody that said, well, you know, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had all these job offers but it\xe2\x80\x99s just way more -- way easier to sit at home and draw unemployment insurance.</p>\n<p>I just -- given the fact that you have -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen articles, read articles by economists who say in a not-so -- in a recession that\xe2\x80\x99s not that intense, you may have applicants that become choosier about the next job that they take.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that there are five applicants for every job right now in America, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those that are unemployed and are offered a job find themselves being overly choosy.\xc2\xa0 I think they find themselves desperately wanting work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is working for -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s increasing exports, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s continuing our investment in clean energy jobs and manufacturing, the President is working to try to continue our economic recovery as -- understanding each and every day, we have much, much more work to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one question about Dr. Berwick?\xc2\xa0 Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on Senate Finance, said that he requested that Berwick be given a hearing a couple weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, Chairman Baucus did not schedule that.\xc2\xa0 Republicans say they were eager to have the hearing.\xc2\xa0 They wanted to talk about Dr. Berwick\xe2\x80\x99s views and things he said in the past, and it was Democrats who flinched.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, two things.\xc2\xa0 We have -- whether everyone likes it or not, we\xe2\x80\x99ve passed a very important Affordable Care Act, many things of which have to be implemented by the beginning of next year.\xc2\xa0 Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Medicare and Medicaid innovation, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s increased investment in health IT technology to ensure greater cost savings and greater quality of care, so we need somebody on the job now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think if you look at the appointments process such as it has been over the past 18 months, I\'m not entirely sure somehow that a hearing was the hurdle.\xc2\xa0 We have had more nominees waiting longer than any administration in recent history.\xc2\xa0 Martha Johnson, who\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a name you know -- she\xe2\x80\x99s the head of the -- she\xe2\x80\x99s the administrator for the General Services Administration -- it took her 10 months to be confirmed to a job of which certainly I can\xe2\x80\x99t recount that her nomination or her name derived some great controversy.\xc2\xa0 Yet it took 10 months and the vote was unanimous.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not talking about Martha Johnson, I\'m talking about Dr. Berwick.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\'m talking about a process that is clearly broken; that the President currently has a total of 189 nominees pending before the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The Senate generally has acted on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominations one or two days before a recess.\xc2\xa0 We have people that are waiting -- 49 of those nominees have been pending for more than six months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is no doubt, Jake, that there is a process up on Capitol Hill right now that was not in any danger of moving forward in a way that was quick enough and needed somebody at HHS to run CMS -- that is an important job.\xc2\xa0 This is somebody who has been -- who all involved say is uniquely qualified.\xc2\xa0 And by that I mean the last two CMS -- the last two people that had run CMS from the Bush administration both strongly supported Dr. Berwick\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Republicans say Berwick supports health care rationing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why they wanted the hearing.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that true?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that criticism?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that Dr. Berwick made the point that we have rationing right now; that health insurance companies are deciding, based on their bottom line, who gets care.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Berwick -- I doubt if Dr. Berwick was a supporter of whatever theory that is supposed to be, that Mark McClellan and Tom Scully, the previous CMS administrators for the Bush administration, would support his nomination.</p>\n<p>Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the type of politics that demonstrates just how badly broken the appointments process is.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to install people that need to be installed for this government to run effective and efficiently.\xc2\xa0 In this case, because the appointments process is clearly broken, he did so through a recess appointment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you want to avoid a hearing because of some of Dr. Berwick\xe2\x80\x99s statements on income redistribution, on praise for the national health service of Britain?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President appointed somebody who he believed -- and people, both Democrats and Republicans believed\xc2\xa0 -- was uniquely and supremely to run an agency of the size of CMS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You and the President and Thad Allen have talked about 90 percent -- or up to 90 percent of the oil coming out of that well being captured by the end of last month.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now at July 7.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, again, which is one of the reasons I talked about the notion --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the weather -- are you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that the latest flow rate estimate that we have is 60,000 barrels per day -- with the Helix online, which was scheduled to happen at the late end of June, you had the potential capability of almost 53,000 barrels, which is 90 percent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the timeline now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe there are a series of things that have to happen, but given the weather and the size of the seas, the waves, we\'re looking at something toward the end of this week -- Friday or the weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, 20 Republicans sent a letter to the Attorney General alleging that the lawsuit challenging the Arizona law -- they say that it reveals Obama\xe2\x80\x99s administration\xe2\x80\x99s contempt for immigration laws and that they\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting that this was done for political reasons.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to what Republicans are saying about the motivation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Political reasons -- how?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, political reasons because there are a lot of Hispanics out there, Latinos, who have been pressing the administration to act on comprehensive immigration reform and they\xe2\x80\x99re pressing the President to take this action, this legal action.\xc2\xa0 They did that at the meeting last week --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President believes we have to have comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that just Latinos hold that viewpoint or that position.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to DOJ specifically on the lawsuit, but obviously as their release said yesterday, you constitutionally cannot have a 50-state patchwork of immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 The only way we\'re going to solve that is through comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It would be better -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99d all be better served if the 20 Republicans would sit down with Democrats in the House and the Senate and we could come up with something on comprehensive immigration reform that the President and members of Congress can see acted upon, so that we can solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did Under Secretary of State Burns and Russian Ambassador Kislyak talk about in their meeting this morning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not been briefed on their meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with this possible spy swap?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I just said I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on their conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You ought to get in the loop.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I will cc Bill Burns on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just talked about the badly broken process.\xc2\xa0 Is using recess appointments to circumvent the Senate part of that badly broken process?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The result of the badly broken process, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think recess appointments should be used sparingly?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have to have people to run government effectively and efficiently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that the process should entitle one to quick disposition.\xc2\xa0 That\'s clearly not happened.\xc2\xa0 The example that I used of the GSA administrator -- I mean, in the first year of the Bush administration, no nominee had to go through the process of invoking cloture because somebody wouldn\'t agree to unanimous consent.\xc2\xa0 Basically, one person can stop this whole process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happened 21 times in the Obama administration.\xc2\xa0 So 21 times -- most of these, again, end up like our administrator for the GSA\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99re approved unanimously.\xc2\xa0 If it takes 10 months to get a unanimous vote, what is one left to believe the 10 months was about?</p>\n<p>Playing the type of politics that people are tired of in order just to stop things from happening -- that\'s not what the function of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- nomination was blocked by Sherrod Brown</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats and Republicans you\'re faulting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On Mr. Berwick, I\'m faulting the Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that if he had gotten a hearing he would be confirmed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The perception is that this recess appointment makes it unnecessary to have these controversial views aired in the public forum.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- well, first and foremost, this is an appointment obviously that is not permanent.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still an appointments process that has to be gone through to make even a recess appointment a permanent one.</p>\n<p>But there are aspects of the health care law that have to be implemented on a timeline that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure many who oppose Dr. Berwick for political reasons didn\'t want to see implemented.\xc2\xa0 We are not going to have the viewpoints of a few hold up the law of the land.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on the DOJ lawsuit, the President has spoken in the past a couple times about his concerns that it might lead to racial profiling, although he didn\'t use that exact phrase.\xc2\xa0 Is he disappointed that this lawsuit makes no legal arguments in that regard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, the President, rightly, believes that what has been filed relating to -- and he was obviously briefed on this prior to the Department of Justice filing -- that the President believes that we filed a strong case based on the fact that you can\xe2\x80\x99t have -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s said this and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t have 50 states making a patchwork of immigration decisions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to work for anybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the omission of that, though, an acknowledgement that that\'s a weaker legal claim?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to DOJ.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Are the export initiatives that you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced over the last couple weeks a recognition that the austerity versus stimulus debate that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been having is politically unproductive and that you really need to change the subject on economic growth?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President made the exports pledge in January -- on January 27, 2010, so I don\'t see how what he pledged five and a half months ago plays into, quite honestly, a fairly stale political back-and-forth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you certainly stepped up your attention to this issue in the last recent days and weeks, clearly trying to change the subject on how to achieve economic growth, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it seem?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I know where you\xe2\x80\x99re going.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand how you\xe2\x80\x99re getting there, given the fact that, again, this was a subject that the President outlined -- I mean, maybe we were just that good and outlined it in January thinking what a great way to change the subject say the 7th or so of July.\xc2\xa0 But I think that would be maybe giving us a shade too much credit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when is the next time the President is going to publicly address the oil spill situation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have talked with scheduling today about the next time that the President will go.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a date, but I think it will be in the next few weeks.\xc2\xa0 I know the First Lady is making a trip down there soon and the Vice President will return again.</p>\n<p>During the senior advisor meeting today, the President was updated on where we are, as well as there was a little more than a half-hour briefing with him at noon to go through sort of where we were in terms of containment and a whole host of issues surrounding oil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily go there, but when do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about it again?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll have anything to say about it in the next couple days or not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of the Mabus end of the recovery effort?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Meaning what?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Mabus --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s down in the region -- was down in the region yesterday and is down in the region today, working with state and local officials to develop a plan over the next several months on Gulf restoration, to develop the process for gathering what that plan will look like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s still a long-range --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely -- look, this will take several months to construct.\xc2\xa0 But again, he\xe2\x80\x99s in the Gulf as we speak meeting with folks, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that as that process gets closer to finishing.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back to trade.\xc2\xa0 The CEO of Ford has been critical of the South Korean free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Seidenberg of Verizon, and on behalf of Business Roundtable, has been critical of the administration for some of its economic policies -- too much intervention reaching too many areas, creating uncertainty in jobs and so -- today these two were appointed to the advisory -- or the export panel.\xc2\xa0 Why was that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure how you -- let me make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not misunderstanding.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not linking necessarily the quote of one to the quote of the other are you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I just wanted to make sure I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t missing anything.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think obviously these are representatives of business that have -- that are promoters of our increased -- increasingly doing business overseas.\xc2\xa0 We understand that unless we have balanced growth, unless we have not just consumer demand here, but are selling things -- selling our products overseas, that long-term sustainable growth is going to be hard to achieve.</p>\n<p>That\'s what the President and his counterparts have talked about in the G20.\xc2\xa0 And I think each of these represents industries that are important to making sure that happens.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have concerns about -- you heard the President enumerate those concerns back even several years about some of the auto provisions in the South Korean free trade agreement that was submitted by the Bush administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, we would take some -- not necessarily obviously agree with the notion that we have somehow been bad for business. And I think corporate profits in the past year have demonstrated that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they have been critical of the administration for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 Have they -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been recently to lunch here, just within the past week or so.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know the CEO of Ford was here not too long -- I think he was at the lunch, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they bring those grievances -- do you know?\xc2\xa0 Did you talk to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I did not go to that lunch with the CEO of Ford.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- I would be shocked if the CEO of Ford didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit at lunch with the President of the United States and discuss his concerns about the previous South Korean free trade agreement.</p>\n<p>Again, I think the reason -- one of the reasons we still see outstanding issues -- and we talked about this in Toronto -- were some of the auto provisions in that.\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I did hear one thing out of the -- I don\'t know how this reconciles with what the second CEO said, but the President took some -- took strong action to ensure that we had a domestic auto industry that was restructured, but that protected the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist today if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taken those steps.\xc2\xa0 And that was something that was mentioned by the CEO of Ford.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, Seidenberg of Verizon, his point was that there\xe2\x80\x99s so much action on the part of government intervening in the markets, it creates uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 Therefore people are less willing to hire -- or wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hire as much because of the uncertainty.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the actions that this President has taken to stabilize the financial system, to increase demand, to inject a Recovery Act into our thinking that -- where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen economic demand created, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen positive economic growth over the course of many quarters, and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen positive job growth for I believe it is six straight months and seven of the last eight months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen positive job growth -- so I think I would argue that the actions that this administration has taken have been squarely on the side of strengthening this country\xe2\x80\x99s economy and bringing it back from where it was when the President took office and 800,000 people were losing their jobs and our economy was contracting at more than 6 percent in a quarter.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a pretty strong resume.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on unemployment compensation.\xc2\xa0 You clearly have a stalemate with the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration open in any way, shape or form to offsetting if not all, a portion of the unemployment compensation costs in order to break that stalemate and get benefits --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to the folks who are going to lose them now and are losing -- in the process of losing them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is something that has -- we have seen for many, many administrations.\xc2\xa0 This has been and should be treated as an emergency, as it makes economic sense to provide benefits to people that are -- because of what happened in this economy two years ago -- with the type of support that they need.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not open to it?\xc2\xa0 Your position will be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I said I didn\'t know of any additional efforts in changing that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the trade issue, I want to make sure I understand the scheduling correctly.\xc2\xa0 Korea would come first, is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Before Panama and Colombia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would show you what the President said today on Panama and Colombia.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As soon as possible, but that does not mean any time before the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a timeline on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, South Korea we talked about as the President will travel in early to mid-November to Seoul, and our expectation is that the outstanding issues can be worked through prior to his getting there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might either -- any of these three be submitted in a lame duck Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I certainly believe it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a priority?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a priority is getting, first and foremost, the issues that we see with -- outstanding resolved.\xc2\xa0 Until we do that, the process can\xe2\x80\x99t play itself out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify on Berwick, the White House received what it -- I believe if I heard you correctly -- regards as concrete proof that the Republicans were going to block Berwick, whether there was a hearing or not?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re representing to us?\xc2\xa0 Or is that an assumption based on the pattern of previous nominees?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I would say there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a hefty dose of both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A hefty does of both?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you received information that said Berwick was going to be blocked --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look the statements --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an assumption; you were told?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the statements that you -- look, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t anything that Bill Burns told me.\xc2\xa0 This was -- you just -- you know if you go on Google, I think you can see that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You saw it on -- okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- that the Republican Party had no intention of moving this nomination forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday said next to the President \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete steps in the next few weeks\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 How did the President interpret that?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House regard and have expectations about those concrete steps being?\xc2\xa0 And \xe2\x80\x9cin a few weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d what does that mean?\xc2\xa0 Does that mean before the moratorium expires?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President said that he believed that we have made good progress in proximity talks.\xc2\xa0 You heard Prime Minister Netanyahu discuss directly -- no pun intended -- his desire to get to direct talks.\xc2\xa0 The issues that will be decided in direct talks I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge.\xc2\xa0 Nobody in this administration is going to prejudge.\xc2\xa0 Those are -- many of these are final status issues that can only be worked out through direct talks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our hope is to create an atmosphere by -- through confidence-building in steps that both sides take so that we can transition from proximity talks to direct talks -- not simply to get to direct talks, but to have those direct talks succeed.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress in that environment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert, on immigration, the politics of immigration are going to play out over the next few months in the 2010 cycle, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s a broader sense of both parties trying to appeal to a growing Latino population.\xc2\xa0 Can you kind of assess where you think that political debate is both short term and long term, and whether or not the filing of the lawsuit alters or in any way changes that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The filing of the lawsuit is based -- I would put it in the rubric of where I would put a number of the decisions, some of which I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in here, things that are the right thing to do but may or may not be, according to your polling or others, the most popular thing to do.\xc2\xa0 But the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t elected to do what\xe2\x80\x99s popular.\xc2\xa0 He was elected to do what was right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our strong belief is that you cannot have 50 states passing a patchwork of immigration laws; that only through federally passed comprehensive immigration reform will we truly have a national standard for how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal this.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason that the lawsuit was filed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but having said that, how does that position play out both short term and long term for Democrats whom the President wants to get elected in --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 2012 or for the President\xe2\x80\x99s relection --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that the politics of -- I think this is true for both Democrats and Republicans -- I think more Democrats than not support comprehensive immigration reform, but it is certainly not a monolithic viewpoint.\xc2\xa0 I am sure different people based on different constituencies and geographies see the politics of immigration reform as very multifaceted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President -- and I think you could -- I think if you look at the polling that all of you all have done on this law in the short term, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty safe to see that the President did this because it was the right thing to do, not because it was the popular thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of scattered questions.\xc2\xa0 Following on the immigration question, will he be talking about immigration when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Nevada with Harry Reid?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a big issue out there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think -- I think the event there will focus more on the economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the President just gave a fairly comprehensive speech on the topic of immigration.\xc2\xa0 Certainly if the topic were to come up, he\xe2\x80\x99d address it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the focus of the luncheon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a Q&amp;A?\xc2\xa0 Is it a town hall --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe it is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then on trade, does the President have a commitment from Democratic leaders in Congress to take up those trade agreements?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten complete assurance.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- and look, I know that there are some that are opposed to this.\xc2\xa0 I think part of that opposition may well have to do with many of the shortcomings that the President as a candidate saw in the previously negotiated free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 We believe there are outstanding issues that can be addressed, and believe that most will reserve judgment on that until there is a product that one puts in front of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is, how confident are you that you can address those outstanding issues to the satisfaction of members of the Democratic Party?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Kirk, is -- was here yesterday in the White House for meetings on this and will work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill as this process moves forward on addressing these outstanding issues, to take into -- to take to the table the viewpoints of those in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then finally, on unemployment -- I don\'t want to sound thick-headed here, but I don\'t understand why, if the President thinks that wars in Iraq and Afghanistan should be budgeted for, why would you not want to either budget for these unemployment benefits or somehow offset them in order to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our viewpoint is that these always have and should be -- this should be emergency spending; that this is -- granted, this is a unique time.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen long-term unemployment the likes of which, as I said earlier, we haven\'t seen in quite some time.\xc2\xa0 But this is important and needs to be done, and should be done as it\xe2\x80\x99s always been done, as emergency spending.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does sound like you are reluctant to admit that this is a long-term problem and that if you were to go offset this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sheryl, I hazard to say I would not make a lot of news if I stood up here, as I\'m about to do, and say that I think we\'re going to be dealing with unemployment for a long, long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That has been said by members of this administration. It\xe2\x80\x99s been said by economists of all political stripes.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t look at what we\'ve been through, you can\'t look at -- I should just have this thing cued up, my favorite graph, which demonstrates the depth of job loss as a result of what happened and led up to the financial collapse in September of 2008.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You cannot look at the depth of that hole -- and I\'ve said this when we\'ve done different briefings -- if you look at -- and granted, I\'m going to make this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a different type of apples comparison because the recessions going back to the \xe2\x80\x9880s have a different size in their labor force -- but if you add the dip in the three recessions that are on that and add them together, right, in the early \xe2\x80\x9880s, in the early \xe2\x80\x9890s, and in 2001 and 2002, it does not equal the dip that started in the recession of December of 2007.</p>\n<p>So the notion that somehow anybody is up here saying, oh, unemployment is some temporary thing, nobody in this administration has said that, and quite frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s not news to say we\'re going to be dealing with it for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how is this any different from the rationalization that Barack Obama criticized in George Bush\xe2\x80\x99s administration when he said, look, the Afghanistan or Iraq spending is emergency spending and we\'re going to do it off books, we\'re not going to pay for it, and the President said --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not always been done like that, Michael.\xc2\xa0 This was -- the emergency spending that was done in the previous administration were in many ways accounting tricks, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this not an administration that has used as an excuse, it\xe2\x80\x99s the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done things.\xc2\xa0 This is an administration that said we need to change the way things work in Washington.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did we laugh when we said it like that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert -- wait, you guys done?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re done.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major is not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I have an issue of transcendent importance:\xc2\xa0 Where does the President LeBron James should play his basketball?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were talking about this earlier today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Indeed.\xc2\xa0 After the news of Miami\xe2\x80\x99s apparent acquiring of Chris Bosh.\xc2\xa0 I think the President still believes that he would look quite good in a Bulls uniform.\xc2\xa0 I hope that does not lead to NBA tampering charges because -- (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- that\'s a good question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he made his view known to anybody?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he did a sports interview not too long ago and was asked if LeBron would look good in a Bulls uniform and said that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried -- in all seriousness, are you worried that that might annoy people in Cleveland who are --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I will say, I think the people in Cleveland -- we all have seen people that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m an Atlanta Braves fan, right?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something that\'s not popular in this town.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a Dallas Cowboys fan, right?\xc2\xa0 Now, if I pretended because I lived in Washington that I\xe2\x80\x99m a Washington fan, that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a genuine thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- we all see people that go to the ballpark and all of a sudden they become the fan of a certain team not because they\xe2\x80\x99ve always liked that team but because they\'re at that ballpark.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President wore a White Sox hat to a Nationals game -- not because he expected to get an ovation for that, just that\'s the team he roots for.\xc2\xa0 I think if --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go, Cubs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- again, I don\'t think the President would -- look, do I think the people of Cleveland have a strong desire to see largely a home state guy -- largely a hometown guy and a home state guy play in Cleveland?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>I think, though, I think the people of Ohio and the rest of the country would respect that the President is going to root for the team he\xe2\x80\x99s always rooted for, not the team that -- you know?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sit up here and tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that Ohio State and Florida play for the national championship every year in all four major sports in order to garner the greatest number of endangered purple state electoral votes prior to 2012.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I told you transcended --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 Amazing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a somewhat serious follow-up, and I will disclose my bias being from Cleveland -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There was actually -- people in Cleveland did take it sort of -- they\'re very sensitive when it comes to these things -- as sort of the President rooting against them and they never catch a break.\xc2\xa0 And sure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want -- he roots for the Bulls, but this might actually really bother people.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will.\xc2\xa0 If the team you rooted for, if the star left that team to go to anywhere, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it would bother people.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- it should.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t think that the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President (inaudible) --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Goyal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as trade is concerned between India and U.S., most of the CEOs who came to meet with the President, they are members of -- or their companies are members of the U.S.-India business council across the street.\xc2\xa0 And the President and Prime Minister met in Toronto -- as the trade between the two countries, where do we stand since the President is going to India in early November also?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In terms of anything new with trade with India, obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s an important partner.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going soon, but I do not have any updates on Indian trade.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, on immigration, what message do you think the President has for those small businesses who are seeking to hire legal people, but they don\'t have those kind of people they are seeking to hire?\xc2\xa0 And what about the people who are seeking legal status?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this, Goyal, the President as part of immigration reform, while he was in the Senate, worked with Senator Grassley on a hiring database to ensure that people weren\xe2\x80\x99t hiring illegals.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- obviously, when we ultimately get to comprehensive immigration reform, that\'s something that is -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to spend some time making sure we get right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the longer this issue goes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a hatred going on among the illegals and among the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this is -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this is a topic that engenders spirited debate and discussion.\xc2\xa0 I also don\'t doubt that there is frustration on both sides of the argument even in Arizona for the federal government not living up to the responsibilities that it has in what is so clearly a federal issue.\xc2\xa0 The President simply believes that that frustration going to 50 states\xe2\x80\x99 different laws isn\xe2\x80\x99t the answer to the problem.\xc2\xa0 We got to focus that energy into something that\'s comprehensive.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With two fundraisers on this next trip, is this the beginning of a new level of involvement by the President in the midterm elections?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President has been involved -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reminded on many occasions on some of the trips that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken for candidates that didn\'t work out -- the President has been involved in midterm races for quite some time, dating back to special elections last year.</p>\n<p>But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we are entering into a -- obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting much, much closer to the fall elections, and the President will have -- will do more things leading up to that.\xc2\xa0 But I think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- he has been very involved in raising money and in making an argument and he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he -- how partisan will he be in his tone?\xc2\xa0 Will we hear about the Boehner ant comment tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll probably hear about Joe Barton, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put aside what you said about being a Dallas fan.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to pretend that didn\'t happen.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On another more important topic, one thing as you have mentioned several times today, the President directed Justice to look at the Arizona law because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a patchwork of state and local laws.\xc2\xa0 But right now there are dozens of so-called sanctuary cities that have their own policies that might potentially conflict with federal law, something that\'s led Governor Brewer to say that if Arizona is in violation of federal law, then so are these localities.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, why did the President only ask DOJ to look at Arizona and not everywhere?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, let me see if I can get -- I don\'t know the answer to that, but I will try to seek some answer on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the President accept the invitation to visit Israel yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly traveled there during the campaign, traveled there while he was a senator.\xc2\xa0 We do not have currently on our schedule travel plans to go there.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, Prime Minister Netanyahu extended an invitation, and I assume at some point the President and the First Lady will visit. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not on the books for this year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Under what circumstances will the President go?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not on the books for this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you ruling it out, or just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the books?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know not it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the books.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m stating the obvious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a silly question --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a silly question.\xc2\xa0 You asked me if it was on the books or if I\xe2\x80\x99m ruling it out.\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying, which apparently is stating the obvious, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the books at this point.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it changes or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask you this one question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President go to -- would he speak in another Muslim capital before he visits Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we would rule that out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that timing is not --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not sort of -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not how --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m Tommy and I\xe2\x80\x99m a Jets fan.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 I have three quick questions, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First, do you -- or does the President have any reaction to the former DOJ lawyer who is making the rounds on television, and I believe he\xe2\x80\x99s testifying before the Civil Rights Commission that the dismissal of charges against the new Black Panther party in the Philadelphia voter intimidation case is indicative --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I can see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the administration not caring about the rights of white voters.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid any attention to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second question.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to Glenn Beck\xe2\x80\x99s August 28th rally, which some are taking as an insult to Martin Luther King\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cI Have a Dream\xe2\x80\x9d speech?\xc2\xa0 Has the President said anything about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen -- let me go back and see what Glenn Beck has said.\xc2\xa0 I just -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be surprised, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t spend an inordinate amount of my time watching --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the permit is under review right now at the National Park Service for use of the Lincoln Memorial -- he was going to do a rally on the steps.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, really, really, quick.\xc2\xa0 During the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Vegas, does he plan to get in a poker game?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They play a lot of Spades on the plane, Reggie and the President, with Marvin and Pete.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll play -- I doubt he\xe2\x80\x99ll go down to the tables.\xc2\xa0 He may play a little bit in his room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Yes, just a couple more follow-ups on the -- Dr. Berwick\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.\xc2\xa0 As far as some of the -- among the controversial comments that he\xe2\x80\x99s made in the past that would have come out in a Senate confirmation hearing are that excellent health care is -- \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent health care, by definition, is redistribution.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Some of the others were mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Does the President actually agree with that comment?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is somebody who is uniquely and supremely qualified to run an agency that is important to our government, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to seniors, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to implementation of the new health care law.\xc2\xa0 And this is somebody supported not just by Democrats but by, as I said earlier, Tom Scully and Mark McClellan, who ran this agency -- both of whom ran this agency for George Bush.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the President agree with the previous statement?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that this is the exact type of political game that the American people have come to understand dominates Washington and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make their health care more affordable.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on this.\xc2\xa0 You said it would have been -- you\xe2\x80\x99re confident there would have been a confirmation had there been a hearing.\xc2\xa0 But do you also think it would have been politically troublesome in an election year to have all these comments aired out about rationing, redistribution that Dr. Berwick had talked about in the past?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You just read comments.\xc2\xa0 Is there like a secret comment book that somehow you got that nobody else got, and you just read a couple of them to me -- (laughter) -- and somebody they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come out?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These aren\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Did he say things like, \xe2\x80\x9crationing happens today; the question is who will do it\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Did he say that?\xc2\xa0 Did he say that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was one comment.\xc2\xa0 The comment that I just read --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Actually, that was Paul Ryan.\xc2\xa0 That was Paul Ryan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, okay --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican in Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 You got your own comments.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not my comment.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine -- okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s your own comment book.\xc2\xa0 But the comment I just read to you came straight out of a speech he gave in Britain --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that came out of Paul Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, the one I just read.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No -- okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s fine --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cRationing happens today; the question is who will do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The quote that I read to you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But you thought that Dr. Berwick said that, right?\xc2\xa0 You told me that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You asked me -- I thought -- it sounded like -- the quote -- I read a separate quote to you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It sounded like it, but it seems to be the viewpoint of the member of Congress that has spent a lot of time talking about health care, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go talk to Paul Ryan and I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to take that question at a later date.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but I read a separate --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert -- okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the issue of comments, you just said that the President\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk a little bit about Joe Barton.\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned -- does he feel that something more should happen to Joe Barton?\xc2\xa0 Because he continues to bring it up weeks afterwards.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is an issue for Republicans to decide whether they want -- whether Republicans want Joe Barton to be the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- keep putting it on the table to get them to deal with the issue, is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s for them to decide to deal with. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they would be surprised that it\xe2\x80\x99s caused them some pain and consternation.\xc2\xa0 It apparently caused so much so on that day that he was called in to apologize.</p>\n<p>So, again, I think it is emblematic, whether it is what John Boehner said or whether it\xe2\x80\x99s what Joe Barton said, it\xe2\x80\x99s emblematic of a mindset -- a mindset that believes that financial reform is basically akin to something the size of an ant, or what caused and precipitated the need for financial reform is something like that.\xc2\xa0 Or somebody who believes, as the ranking member of the Energy Committee, that the apology is due not to the people of the Gulf whose lives have been altered but to the company that caused it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I want to get to the issue of messaging on this racial profiling in Arizona and its challenge to their law.\xc2\xa0 You say the President did this as it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, not because it\xe2\x80\x99s popular.\xc2\xa0 What kind of message are you going to give to the American public?\xc2\xa0 How are you going to generate a message as, again, going back to the prior question, polls are showing that most Americans are for this racial profiling, not just for Latinos but also Caribbean nationals in Arizona?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would simply say that -- go back to my earlier answer, in that the President did not make a determination about what to do -- or has not made a determination about what to do on immigration based on what\xe2\x80\x99s popular, and the Department of Justice didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a determination on filing this lawsuit based on what\xe2\x80\x99s popular -- they did it on what was right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to go into the community and talk about it to generate more support on your side versus on the other side?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President has spoken clearly on his desire to see comprehensive immigration reform -- the reason why we believe it needs to happen and the reason why\xc2\xa0 -- understanding the frustration, but believing that the output of what happened in Arizona actually makes it harder to get a comprehensive immigration reform standard that the whole country can deal with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fifth anniversary of Katrina is next month --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you are, but I\xe2\x80\x99m -- the fifth anniversary of Katrina is next month.\xc2\xa0 And how is the President -- is that going to be overshadowed totally by BP, or is the President going to have a separate --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll look at the schedule and have some -- let me go to Sam and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go home --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not go home, just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the economy.\xc2\xa0 You talk about unemployment is going to last a very long time.\xc2\xa0 Looking at the next couple days, how does the President sell this concept of recovery summer when people aren\xe2\x80\x99t seeing a recovery?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first and foremost, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand, Sam, that the President is going to continue to make the case for the steps that we took being the right steps to take.\xc2\xa0 Again, they may not have always been politically popular, but they were the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Long ago, even when we were talking about the Recovery Act just as legislation, we always said that it was never going to -- it was never the size and scope of the output removed from the economy because of the recession -- it was never going to totally fill that hole.\xc2\xa0 But we believe it has put us on a path to recovery, that the economy is stronger now than it was -- certainly than it was then, and that we continue to make progress.</p>\n<p>The President and the Vice President particularly will highlight the steps that are being taken this year and this summer on specific recovery projects, a big ramp-up in infrastructure, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s safe drinking water projects or road construction projects.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I will say this, Sam, the President was never under the illusion that economic recovery was going to happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 It is going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 We will deal with the political ramifications of that.\xc2\xa0 I think the biggest -- the most important thing is, are we moving in the right direction?\xc2\xa0 Are we making progress?\xc2\xa0 And is the economy getting stronger, even if the pace is not altogether like we\xe2\x80\x99d want to see?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean -- I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, is the President frustrated?\xc2\xa0 I mean, even some economists that I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to say, look, this would be so much worse if these steps hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been taken.\xc2\xa0 Is the President frustrated that that\xe2\x80\x99s not getting through?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because -- well, frustrated in the sense that, look, obviously you would like everyone to look back and say, here\xe2\x80\x99s where I am and here\xe2\x80\x99s where I could have been.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable why people don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think that.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be frustrated, just as I think the American people will be frustrated, as long as there are people that want desperately to find work and are either working part-time or can\xe2\x80\x99t find full-time jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s understandable on their part; it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable on his part.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The question is, are we taking the steps each and every day to build that consumer demand, to increase our exports, to create jobs here and sell products overseas?\xc2\xa0 Are we taking all the steps -- and the President has certainly tasked his team to make sure that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:44 P.M.
