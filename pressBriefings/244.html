Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Before we get started, why don\'t I give you a quick update on the ongoing situation at the New York Stock Exchange? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis afternoon, the President was briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, and the White House Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, about the technical issues that are currently being experienced by the New York Stock Exchange. \xc2\xa0Lisa Monaco told the President that, at this point, there is no indication that malicious actors are involved in these technology issues. \xc2\xa0She informed the President that New York Stock Exchange officials had been in close touch with the Department of Homeland Security, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe officials at the Stock Exchange are working feverishly, as you would expect, to try to resolve the situation. \xc2\xa0For an update on their efforts, I\'d encourage you to contact them. \xc2\xa0The President told Ms. Monaco and Mr. McDonough that he wanted to continue to be updated on the situation over the course of the day. \xc2\xa0But at this point, there is no indication that malicious actors were involved in these technology issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, Darlene, we can talk about this some more or take other questions you may have today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Even though you say that there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that malicious actors are involved, is that something federal authorities are still kind of being on guard for as they continue to look into what happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, the administration is keenly aware of the risks that exist in cyberspace right now. \xc2\xa0There are a number of steps that this administration has taken to improve communication between the private sector and the federal government when it comes to safeguarding cyberspace. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would point out that the Stock Exchange is actually an example of a private sector entity that has a strong relationship with the federal government. \xc2\xa0And one of the most important elements of our strategy for safeguarding the nation\xe2\x80\x99s computer networks from cyber threats is effective communication and sharing of information between private sector officials and the federal government, particularly those elements of the federal government that are responsible for responding to cyber threats.<br/>\n\tThe New York Stock Exchange does have an effective information-sharing relationship with the federal government, and I think the information that I shared with you is an indication of how valuable that kind of information-sharing can be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given what has happened today, did the federal government take any steps to beef up its own cybersecurity defenses, or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the federal government is obviously very vigilant about the steps that we need to take to protect federal computer systems. \xc2\xa0The kind of security measures that are in place are sometimes obvious to the general public; sometimes they aren\'t. \xc2\xa0We also work aggressively to make sure that the kind of defenses that we have in place reflect the threats that we perceive. \xc2\xa0And this means that our security posture is continually evolving to reflect the current threat environment.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have any steps that we\'ve taken at this point to tell you, but I can assure you that officials, even on days when these kinds of questions are not lingering in the air, are very vigilant about their need to adapt to an environment in cyberspace that is filled with malicious actors.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a different subject, on the Hill today, Senators Schumer and Portman unveiled details of a plan to sort of overhaul the way U.S. companies pay taxes on foreign profits, and some of the money they would propose using for infrastructure -- roads, bridges, et cetera. \xc2\xa0Do you have any reaction or comment on that framework that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Senator Schumer and Senator Portman have communicated to the administration about their report, and we certainly applaud their interest in this area. \xc2\xa0The Treasury Department is still reviewing the details of the report that they have issued, so I would refer you to the Treasury Department for a specific reaction to the report that they\xe2\x80\x99ve issued.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the President has put forward his own specific plan for reforming our tax code in a way that would close tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and using some of that revenue to invest in infrastructure that benefits everybody -- that would have important benefits for our economy over the long term, but also would have important benefits for the job market in the short term. \xc2\xa0All these kinds of infrastructure upgrades would stimulate further hiring in the job market. \xc2\xa0That\'s obviously a worthwhile goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore broadly, I can tell you what the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal when it comes to tax reform is to make our tax system more simple, more fair, and ensure that American businesses are in a position to compete. \xc2\xa0And that is the aim of the proposal that the President himself has put forward, but we obviously welcome the interest from these two senators on this particular issue. \xc2\xa0Obviously there is a lot of important reform that is necessary for our tax code that would have positive economic benefits for the entire country.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back on the stock exchange. \xc2\xa0Even if it turns out that it was not a malicious actor involved, is the President concerned about the effect of this glitch or whatever it is on investors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly what kind of impact this particular glitch will have. \xc2\xa0Obviously the market has been closed here for 90 minutes or so. \xc2\xa0So as the officials at the Stock Exchange get to the bottom of what exactly has occurred, make the repairs that are necessary and get it back up and running, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a longer look at what sort of impact a disruption like this may have caused.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any concern that it could have an economic impact for being closed, even for a short period of time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is something that the Treasury Department continues to monitor. \xc2\xa0Obviously the Securities and Exchange Commission is doing the same thing. \xc2\xa0At this point, it\'s too early to offer an assessment about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a different stock market -- stocks in China have been falling for the last week, and despite intervention from the Chinese as well as the central bank there, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to stop it. \xc2\xa0Is this on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s radar? \xc2\xa0And do you have any concerns about that affecting the global economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff, the administration -- particularly the Treasury Department but also economic officials here at the White House -- do closely monitor activity on global financial markets. We do live in an age where our global financial markets are interconnected and interrelated, and activity that we do see in one market could have an impact on other markets, so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we carefully monitor.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of assessing the impact of the volatility that we saw in China\xe2\x80\x99s stock market, I would reserve judgment on that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll let those who are a little bit more experienced and skilled in putting together that kind of analysis to put forward their own judgment. \xc2\xa0But, yes, this is something that is closely monitored by the administration -- principally by the United States Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, just can you give an update on any White House communications with the Europeans about Greece, what your assessment is on the situation now after the Prime Minister addressed parliament, and what contingency plans the United States might be making for a Greek bankruptcy this weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other presidential calls to tell you about. \xc2\xa0As you recall, I believe it was just yesterday that the President spoke to both Chancellor Merkel from Germany and Prime Minister Tsipras from Greece. \xc2\xa0The day before, the President had spoken to President Hollande from France. \xc2\xa0And the truth is the President has been in touch with his European counterparts on this issue over the last several months. \xc2\xa0Many of those European officials have actually been visiting the White House over the course of this year, and resolving the financial situation in Greece was the subject of discussion in each of those meetings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that Secretary Lew, who has been the principal point of contact of the administration in dealing with this issue, has continued to be in touch with his counterparts around the world, and he will continue to be as Greece and its creditors attempt to resolve their differences. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur view on this, despite the colorful activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on this issue over the last week or so -- or 10 days or so \xc2\xa0-- has not changed. \xc2\xa0Our view continues to be that it remains in the collective interest of Greece and their creditors for the situation to be resolved in a way that allows Greece to remain part of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s currency union. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur view is that the solution is essentially the assembly of a package of financing and reforms that puts Greece back on a path toward economic growth and debt sustainability. \xc2\xa0And that is pretty easily said, but not easily done, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require all parties to focus on their collective mutual interest. And that is the thing that we have long taken to heart, is that for all of the turmoil and all of the rancor and the negotiations, the fact that they have a collective interest in resolving the situation in the same way continues to be evident. And as long as the negotiators are focused on that, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be hopeful about a positive outcome, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe is in the best interest of the United States as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Iran, first of all, the administration seemed to be saying over the last few days that the deadlines that have been put in the past have served a purpose, but now as we get close the deadlines are not as important, and that you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to talk as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s something to talk about. \xc2\xa0There are those who criticize that and say that the further delays is allowing -- further delays are allowing Iran to continue to build up a nuclear program. \xc2\xa0Do you agree with that? \xc2\xa0Is that true? \xc2\xa0And are there safeguards against that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, it\xe2\x80\x99s not true. \xc2\xa0And this is a concern that this administration has been cognizant of since the very beginning, which is that there had been a history of Iran using the cover of diplomatic talks to continue to advance their nuclear program, that they would essentially fend off any sort of international scrutiny or limitations on their nuclear program by saying, well, the diplomatic talks are ongoing. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States and our P5+1 partners insisted that Iran would take steps to freeze their nuclear program in place in most aspects; in other aspects, actually roll back key aspects of their nuclear program while the talks are ongoing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s occurred over the last year and a half. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why, early on, we saw a lot of Republicans, critics of the administration, suggesting that entering into talks with Iran were a really bad idea. \xc2\xa0Even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I believe, described it as a \xe2\x80\x9chistoric mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0The fact is, after a year and a half or so, many Republicans are now suggesting that rather than trying to reach a final agreement with Iran, that what the administration should just do is leave the agreement that they previously criticized in place because it\xe2\x80\x99s been good for our national security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is the concern that Iran could use diplomatic talks as cover for advancing their nuclear program is something that we were aware of from the beginning and actively took steps to prevent, and that effort has been successful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the meeting last night that the President had with the Senate Democrats, among those who were there was Bernie Sanders. \xc2\xa0Was there any specific conversation between President Obama and Mr. Sanders, since he is doing so well, surprisingly well, on the campaign trail?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any specific conversation that the two men had yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, finally, if I could, on the issue of Bill Cosby. \xc2\xa0Bill Cosby, in fact, has a congressional -- I\'m sorry, a Presidential Medal of Freedom that was granted to him by President Bush. \xc2\xa0Today, a group of victims of rape came out and asked President Obama to revoke his Medal of Freedom. \xc2\xa0Does the President have that power? \xc2\xa0And would he consider doing that as Mr. Cosby comes under fire?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen that particular statement from the group that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t at this point heard any discussion of taking that step. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that, as a general matter, this administration has been very focused on countering sexual assault, and doing so in a variety of settings. \xc2\xa0The administration has been very active in pushing the military, who, to their credit, has taken some important steps to root out sexual assault in the military. \xc2\xa0The President has spoken very forcefully as the Commander-in-Chief about those efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration has worked hard to prevent -- to build awareness and put in place programs to prevent sexual assault on college campuses across the country. \xc2\xa0And the President has played a leading role in the \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s On Us\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, which makes clear that all of us have a responsibility to step up and to speak out to ensure the safety of people in our community. \xc2\xa0And this is an issue that the President feels strongly about and he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken forcefully about it in the past, and that continues to be true to this day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And revoking a medal like this would be unprecedented, I understand. \xc2\xa0Is it possible, do you know? \xc2\xa0Is it legally possible for it to be pulled back? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, but we can look into that for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Follow-up question please, Josh?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First I wanted to discuss about the Stock Exchange. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if you guys are anticipating any sort of federal investigation into what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, whether from the SEC or the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I\'m not aware of a federal investigation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re just a couple hours into the situation, but obviously the Securities and Exchange Commission will be closely monitoring this situation, and so if there were to be an investigation, I assume it would fall under their jurisdiction. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d be sure to check with them before the end of the day. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut obviously the Department of Homeland Security has some equities in this as well. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of anything that\xe2\x80\x99s planned right now, but we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in the very early stages of this. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Chinese stock market, Secretary Lew said earlier today that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worried about the immediate impact but that could sort of slow important financial reforms within China because it could, I guess, keep the Chinese from pivoting towards a more market-based economy. \xc2\xa0Is there anything that the White House or the federal government is doing to encourage China to continue to take those market reforms despite some of the turbulence in their stock market?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific conversations that have arisen in the last five or six days that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this renewed volatility in the securities markets in China. \xc2\xa0But it has been a consistent message that\'s been delivered by U.S. officials about the importance of these kinds of economic reforms being effectively implemented in China. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has -- and I believe this is true even of the previous administration -- has made the case to China that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just in the best interest of the global economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s actually in the best interests of the Chinese economy for these kinds of reforms to be implemented; that we could actually make some progress in stabilizing the economy over the longer term if they were able to effectively implement these kinds of reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m confident this is the kind of thing that was discussed at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue that was hosted here in Washington last month, where both Secretary Kerry and Secretary Lew had the opportunity to meet with their counterparts. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that officials at the Treasury Department could tell you a little bit more about those conversations that Secretary Lew had with his counterpart.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on Puerto Rico, Senators Schumer and Blumenthal said that they\'re going to introduce a bill on Chapter 9 access to mirror a bill in the House that\'s being supported by Nancy Pelosi and others. \xc2\xa0I know that you guys have said that this is something that you want Congress to look at, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering was this, first, a topic of discussion between the President and those senators last night, and secondly, whether now that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- kind of more concrete details are coming out whether you can fully endorse the effort that\'s being championed by Democrats.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\'t attend the meeting that the President had with Democratic senators here yesterday, but I got a pretty detailed readout of the meeting. \xc2\xa0A discussion of Puerto Rico was not included in the detailed readout that I received, so I don\'t think that it came up. \xc2\xa0If it did, it didn\'t come up in the context of an extensive discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, you\'re right, we have been, for the better part of a week and a half here, been suggesting that this is something that Congress should take a careful look at and that we\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to work with them on it, because it would ensure that Puerto Rico would have access to some greater tools to deal with some of the financial challenges that they\'re experiencing right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the specific piece of legislation that you just referenced, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that White House officials will take a close look at it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you want to share all the details with us on that meeting that you were -- (laughter) -- or any more details on that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens over the course of the briefing. \xc2\xa0Thanks, Justin.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to go back to what Jim asked. \xc2\xa0With your answer, it seems this administration is well aware of the news reports about Bill Cosby, this iconic man who now -- information has been released that he, indeed, gave Quaaludes to women. \xc2\xa0What is the President saying about this, particularly as he is someone who has promoted women and girls? \xc2\xa0And as you said, he has fought against issues of sexual assault in the military and on college campuses. \xc2\xa0What is he personally saying about this, as Bill Cosby is an iconic person throughout the years, and globally, not just in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe the last time the President talked about this was he was asked about it in an interview with Univision back in December. \xc2\xa0So you can take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments at that point. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him since these latest revelations that were reported publicly in the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But with this -- and going back to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question -- is it out of the realm of possibility? \xc2\xa0Because of this -- and again, the times that we\'re in, the fact that there is a push for women and girls in this administration, and the fact that you are countering sexual assaults -- with somebody like this, this could be a very big statement. \xc2\xa0Would the administration consider revoking his medal from the White House, from the Bush administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned to Jim, I don\'t know whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s legally possible to do so. \xc2\xa0But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you investigate the possibility, because, again, of what I asked?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get an answer to the question that you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also, with everything that\'s going on on the racial front, there has been a call by an organization under the name of John Hope Franklin, a gentleman who headed former President Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on race, his race initiative -- they\'re calling for a conversation on race. \xc2\xa0I know President Obama, at the funeral of -- when he delivered the eulogy, saying that he was not looking for conversation on race -- that they felt -- they feel that this is the time for it, especially with all the divisive comments that are coming -- we have Donald Trump, we have this and that person, and they\'re feeling that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for a conversation on race. \xc2\xa0And this President is the moral leader to be able to do that. \xc2\xa0What do you say to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I recall from the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks a couple of weeks ago, the President says we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about race and that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the nation to sort of consider what that discussion actually means when it comes to trying to make our country more fair, more just, an essentially a more perfect union. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something the President thinks about every single day. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something that a lot of Americans think about every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, on that point, I talked to an NAACP board member, Dr. Amos Brown, who was one of the students of Dr. Martin Luther King for that one year at Morehouse College, and he said people like Donald Trump -- the comments that Donald Trump are making, the divisive comments are things that perpetuated Dylann Roof to commit the murders that he did in South Carolina. \xc2\xa0What do you say to people who have that microphone right now, who have that podium, to be able to speak -- and people are listening, and the comments people are taking in -- what do you say to people like Dr. Brown and other people who feel that this is not the time for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve studiously avoided -- with a lot of success -- responding to comments and, in some cases, outrageous claims made by possible presidential candidates. \xc2\xa0So I think this falls pretty cleanly in that category.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not a possible -- he is a presidential candidate now and he is making strong statements against a community that this President is embracing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think he has gotten all the attention and response that he is going to get, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to add to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there were three episodes today that got a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s attention -- Wall Street Journal, United Airlines, New York Stock Exchange. \xc2\xa0Was the President briefed on all three, and is he sharing the federal law enforcement interpretation currently that these are all coincidental? \xc2\xa0Just to clarify all that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President was also briefed on the incident at United Airlines. \xc2\xa0At United Airlines, the readout is quite similar -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication at this point either that there is malicious activity involved or that it was related to any other of the high-profile technology issues that have cropped up today. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether there was a conversation about the Wall Street Journal website, or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That this appears to be coincidental and not based on malicious intent.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, there is no indication that it\xe2\x80\x99s based on malicious intent or that these events are related.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about something that did have malicious intent behind it. \xc2\xa0Have you developed any more information that you can share with us -- because you were not, the last time we raised this with you -- about the OPM and Interior Department hacks either in scale, origination, or damage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more information to share with you in terms of the assessment about the scope of this particular incident. \xc2\xa0But I know that our officials who are taking a look at this are working hard to get to a place where they can provide additional information.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any timetable of that that you can share with us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific timetable for you. \xc2\xa0This is a priority for them; that we have made clear that when we investigate incidents like this, we want to try to share as much information as we can both with those who have been affected but also with the public. \xc2\xa0And so that continues to be a priority, and so I would expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information on this soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you referred to the Greek economic conversations, you seemed to be making if not light, at least in a low-level way, mocking some of the hype around the potential downside to this, or the calamity that has crept into some of the headlines. Is that because the President is of the mind, based on his conversations, that this is going to get worked out and that all of the fear associated with what might or might not happen is overblown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave you with the impression that we somehow don\xe2\x80\x99t take this seriously. \xc2\xa0I think what I was referring to is that there have been over the course of the rancorous negotiations, not just over the last several years but also over the last several weeks, some colorful displays of disagreement and conflict, and I was making perhaps too light a reference to those actions and, in some cases, comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have said is that when it comes to the U.S. economy, there is very little direct risk to the U.S. economy from the Greek economy -- or direct exposure for the U.S. economy to the Greek economy. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the risk that we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about is the impact that some additional volatility in the European economy could have on the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0Obviously, we do have an important economic relationship with Europe, particularly when it comes to exports, and so we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of that. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we monitor significant financial events on the European continent, and certainly the ongoing negotiations between Greece and their creditors would fall in that category.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you have well-deserved reputation -- you and this administration -- of sometimes reminding us that we can get a little over-cooked on certain things. \xc2\xa0It almost sounded to me today as if you were trying to say the President is of a mind that because of the conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s had after the referendum and if the negotiations are continuing, it is his belief this is going to be worked out. \xc2\xa0He is not anxious about all of this falling apart. \xc2\xa0Is that a fair interpretation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, I don\'t think I would interpret my comments that way. \xc2\xa0I think this is something that we continue to be concerned about, but we continue to take solace in the fact that it is in the clear, collective interest of all those who are sitting around the negotiating table to resolve this in a way that includes Greece -- continues to include Greece in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s currency union. \xc2\xa0And we\'re hopeful that that\'s the way the situation will be resolved. \xc2\xa0But it\'s going to require all sides to come together around a package of reforms and financing that would allow Greece to resume a path of debt sustainability and economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Former Attorney General Holder said something a couple of days ago that I haven\'t had a chance to ask you about. \xc2\xa0And there were few people in the Cabinet closer to the President than Eric Holder; he\xe2\x80\x99s held in incredibly high regard by the President, by those who work closest with him. \xc2\xa0And he said \xe2\x80\x9cit is a possibility\xe2\x80\x9d -- direct quote -- that Eric Snowden could obtain a plea agreement through the Justice Department and that he created \xe2\x80\x9ca necessary debate on surveillance and national security in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does the President agree with both of those statements? \xc2\xa0It\'s hard to hear Eric Holder say that and believe he is not in some way, shape or form, trying to represent a change in thinking within this White House as it regards Eric Snowden.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d caution you against reading his comments in that way. \xc2\xa0As it relates to his treatment in the criminal justice system, that\'s something that I\'m going to reserve comment on, simply because it is the view of this administration that Mr. Snowden has been charged with very serious crimes and we believe that he should return to the United States to face those charges. \xc2\xa0If he were to do so, he would be afforded all of the rights to due process that are given to other American citizens. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t have any information to share about whether or not there are even any ongoing negotiations that could allow that to come about.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the broader political debate that was spawned after Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s revelations, we\'ve been clear that if Mr. Snowden had concerns -- and it\'s evident that he did -- that there was and there continue to be proper channels for expressing that concern in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do the significant damage to the national security of the United States that was brought about by the disclosures that Mr. Snowden made.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this administration has worked hard to make sure that we\'re protecting whistleblowers and others who may have concerns about U.S. government activity, and the President has also shown a responsiveness to the broader public concerns that have been expressed in the context of this political debate. \xc2\xa0In fact, with the most recent renewal of some of our national security infrastructure\xe2\x80\x99s surveillance programs, there are some significant reforms that have been put in place. \xc2\xa0And I think that is a testament to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to making sure that we strike this appropriate balance between protecting the privacy of the American people but also protecting the national security of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When the former Attorney General says it\'s a possibility there could be a plea agreement, is that just an ill-informed speculation on his part?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously it\'s informed based on his own experience working in the administration. \xc2\xa0But those kinds of decisions are decisions that are made -- those prosecutorial decisions are decisions that are made by the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0So he would have some insight into that process that I would not have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we should not interpret it as something that is either part of ongoing conversations or a new softening of the administration to this question of bringing him home and pleading this out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think you should interpret it as an expression of Mr. Holder\xe2\x80\x99s personal opinion, but not as the signaling of a change in policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Affirmatively furthering fair housing -- we actually heard about it back in 2013. \xc2\xa0I wanted to have you address some of the concerns that a lot of Americans have that this is social engineering, sort of an administration overreach. What would you say to Americans who have, I think, legitimate concerns that this is somehow going to change their neighborhood, or change the way that their towns and cities are operating?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think the first thing that people should understand is that the administration continues to believe that zoning is and should remain a local power. \xc2\xa0This rule, that is based on a law that\xe2\x80\x99s been on the books for 50 years, does not infringe on local decision-making. \xc2\xa0In fact, it actually supports decision-making and ensures that more resources and more data can be provided to local officials as they make land use and zoning decisions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is what we believe is the proper role of the federal government as we work with state and local officials to accomplish what I think we all share as a priority, which is ensuring affordable, quality housing for every single American. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when local leaders say this will impact the way we make our own decisions with the power of the purse, they\xe2\x80\x99re not being accurate?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What this administration believes -- and this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve long believed -- is that zoning is and should remain a local power. \xc2\xa0And what the Department of Housing and Urban Development can provide is additional data, additional tools, and additional guidance to local officials who we know share the goal of ensuring that everyone has access to quality, affordable housing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about the Iran talks. \xc2\xa0And someone sort of put it in, I thought, a pretty unique way. \xc2\xa0Is this a win-win for the administration if the talks break down or go forward? \xc2\xa0Because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t happen, he could -- the President could then say, well, I walked away from a bad deal. \xc2\xa0If they do go forward, he can say, I did something transformative. \xc2\xa0Is that being too cynical? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way that we see it. Our preference would be for Iran to sign on the dotted line of a final agreement that reflects the political commitments that they reached in Switzerland back in April. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States, working with our P5+1 partners, has succeeded in getting Iran to the negotiating table, and laying out a clear mechanism for shutting off every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon, and implementing the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require Iran to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take on those commitments. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our hope is that they will choose to do that. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, the President has made clear that if they choose not to do that that having no deal at all is far better than agreeing to a bad deal. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because the way you laid it out was, we\xe2\x80\x99ll walk away, we have snapback provisions if they break the deal. \xc2\xa0So it kind of looks like this is a win no matter what.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication is that the ball is in the court of the Iranians. \xc2\xa0That we -- and when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean the United States and the administration -- I mean the United States and some of our closest allies and partners around the world have made a compelling case to Iran that it is time for them to make serious commitments about the peaceful nature of their nuclear program, to verify that they will not acquire a nuclear weapon, and to agree to a set of verification measures that would ensure their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNo longer -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put ourselves in a situation where we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to take Iran\xe2\x80\x99s word for it. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to sign on the dotted line and go our separate ways. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to sign on the dotted line and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to send international inspectors to Iran so they can keep eyes on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and verify their ongoing compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you -- and I know DOD will address this as well -- 40,000 Army ranks cut, an additional 17,000-plus civilian Army employees. \xc2\xa0There are a number of small communities -- and large -- that are gravely concerned about the impact economically this will have, to say nothing of the morale. What\xe2\x80\x99s the mindset and the rationale behind making such dramatic cuts, especially given all that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing in the world right now militarily?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that a couple of ways, Kevin. \xc2\xa0The first is that this is part of a long-planned drawdown and a multi-year process as part of the Quadrennial Defense Review. \xc2\xa0This is an interagency effort -- and obviously the President has confidence in the Army\xe2\x80\x99s continued ability to fight and win our nation\xe2\x80\x99s wars. \xc2\xa0And obviously, our men and women in uniform make significant sacrifices to ensure that we enjoy these freedoms and that we have these unique capabilities. \xc2\xa0And the Commander-in-Chief is grateful for the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these are steps that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking consistent with the view of our civilian and uniform military leadership about the threats that the country faces, and the need to ensure that our fighting force is composed in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with those threats. \xc2\xa0And the fact is it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations when it comes to the number of or the size of the force. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the President following through on the commitment that he made at the beginning of his presidency to responsibly withdraw troops from Iraq and to make some responsible decisions about Afghanistan that has reduced our military footprint and continues to put us on a path of reducing the number of military personnel that are committed to that country, as well. \xc2\xa0And this reflects the changing requirements that the United States Army must uphold.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the communities, though? \xc2\xa0They\'re going to be severely impacted. \xc2\xa0You do know that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And what I would say about that is that this is part of the kind of decision-making that the military has to go through on a regular basis, and this reflects a long-planned, multi-year process for taking a look at exactly what the needs are of the United States military and this reflects the decision that was made by the uniformed and civilian military leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me just follow up, if I can, on the three cyber incidents today, which are the New York Stock Exchange, United and the Wall Street Journal. \xc2\xa0And even though there are no indications that there were bad actors involved here, I wonder where the White House is on the cybersecurity? \xc2\xa0Does this change the prioritization since it\xe2\x80\x99s back in the conversation? \xc2\xa0And would you assume that this will be a major topic when he meets with Secretary Lew?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that this is a top policy priority of this administration even when it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the news. \xc2\xa0The President continues to be very mindful of the risk associated with activity in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as Major alluded to in his questioning, we\'re very mindful of the risk that U.S. government computer systems face from determined and creative adversaries that would love to have access to the information that\'s stored on those computer networks. \xc2\xa0We\'re mindful of the kinds of activities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from adversaries in cyberspace against private U.S. interests, as well. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that this administration has done is put forward specific legislation to the United States Congress that would improve the flow of information between public and private entities when it comes to cybersecurity. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one of the things that our cybersecurity professionals tell us is that quickly sharing information is critical to our ability to defend both public and private computer networks; that when our adversaries are able to exploit a particular flaw in one computer network, we need to make sure that that information is quickly communicated to law enforcement officials both so they can help the operators of that one network respond to that incident and contain the damage, but also communicate with public and private networks all across the country to ensure they\'re aware of this particular tactic and can bolster their defenses against it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is we would like to see Congress pass that legislation that we moved up to Capitol Hill six months ago. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s long overdue for Congress to take the kinds of actions that we believe are necessary to keep the American people and their data safe in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything that\'s been done recently on that front then? \xc2\xa0Three years, three times it\xe2\x80\x99s failed. \xc2\xa0Did pass in the House, but it -- was it part of the conversation last night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know that it was part of the conversation that the President had with Democratic senators yesterday. \xc2\xa0But this continues to be an important priority, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see some congressional action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in terms of the average American who has felt the impact of many of these breaches, whether it was Target, or insurance companies, or now people who, frankly, were left stranded for a while this morning by United or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make trades -- there\xe2\x80\x99s also a question of functionality. \xc2\xa0And I wonder if you could speak to the role that the federal government plays in ensuring that, especially in a time where it does seem to a lot of people like it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely difficult to keep up with where our dependence on the Internet is going.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would want to draw a distinction between the technical issues that were --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- functionality and economic --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, yes, the technical issues that were experienced at United were different than the kind of cyber-attacks that Target and others entities have faced.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we have -- what the administration has made a priority is trying to help computer systems across the country bolster their defenses against malicious cyber activity. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken some important steps to try to do that. \xc2\xa0The best example of that is that there are five Chinese military officials that were indicated by the Justice Department a year or two ago because of their conduct in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0That\'s an indication that we take this quite seriously and that the U.S. government and that our federal prosecutors, in particular, are willing to take serious steps to try to go after those adversaries that are seeking to either steal information or to wreak havoc in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0And we\'re aware of the threat those individuals pose. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, there is a question about the basic infrastructure and architecture of the country. \xc2\xa0And while roads and bridges and railways and runways are critical to the basic infrastructure of the country, so, too, is the infrastructure of the Internet. \xc2\xa0And making sure that that equipment and that software is up to date and reflects the burden that we place on the modern computer infrastructure of the country is also important and something that we\'re mindful of.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But let me just finish by saying at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell, though, what sort of impact -- whether that basic computer infrastructure was in any way responsible for some of high-profile, technical problems that emerged today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last question on -- back when the President was talking about the hack that affected 4 million federal workers, he talked about a problem within the federal government of some very old systems. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any update where the government is -- where the federal government is on improving those systems.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that the Office of Management and Budget has been engaged in an effort to streamline the information technology procurement process at the federal government. \xc2\xa0And what an initial review found is that oftentimes the procurement process required so much time that by the time the procurement process concluded and a purchase was ready to be made, that the purchase was of either software or equipment that, over the course of time that the procurement process had lasted, had become if not obsolete, at least out of date. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that buying office furniture is different than buying computer software. \xc2\xa0And we need to make sure that we have rules that govern the federal procurement process that reflect that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are obviously a lot of equities involved. \xc2\xa0We also want to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the best bang for the buck when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. \xc2\xa0And we also want to make sure that we are capitalizing on all of the built-in advantages that are enjoyed by the federal government, including bulk purchasing. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of conflicting interests here, but this is something that we have taken a close look at because it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that some improvements can be made in a way that would benefit taxpayers and the service that they receive from their federal government.</p>\n<p>\n\tJerome.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to Greece. \xc2\xa0All the European countries are far from being on the same wavelength. \xc2\xa0The President had a chance to talk to Chancellor Merkel several times over the past week. \xc2\xa0Does he believe she should be more flexible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President did have the opportunity to speak to her yesterday, and it was not the first time that they\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed this issue. \xc2\xa0I know that they had an opportunity to discuss this when the President was in Germany just about a month ago at the G7 summit. \xc2\xa0And I know that they discussed this issue when Chancellor Merkel visited the White House earlier this year. \xc2\xa0So this is -- and those are just the examples of times in which they discussed the issue this year. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that over the last several years this is something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to discuss on a number of occasions. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to violate the confidentiality of two world leaders having a private conversation, but I can tell you that the general message that the President has conveyed to her in private is consistent with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in public, and that is it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the collective interest of all of those involved to resolve this in a way that ends with Greece remaining part of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s currency union. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has acknowledged at every turn that this is not a situation that the United States can or wants to solve for them. \xc2\xa0By the way, there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication that the Europeans would like the United States to step in and solve what is a European problem. \xc2\xa0And the President has been direct about his view that the best path to an agreement is one that centers on a package of reforms and financing that puts Greece back in range of debt sustainability and economic growth. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that we can -- that Europe can remain as integrated and united and as strong as they would like to be. \xc2\xa0And the President has been blunt about his view that a strong, integrated, highly functioning, prosperous Europe is within the clear national security interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has played the role that we have in trying to encourage all the parties to come together and to facilitate an agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tColleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following up on that, Secretary Lew said this morning that Europe needed to restructure Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt to keep the country in the Eurozone. \xc2\xa0And it was the first time we kind of heard him use that language -- \xe2\x80\x9crestructuring the debt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0When Obama spoke to Chancellor Merkel yesterday, did he signal that the U.S. was going to express that view publicly, or is that a message that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering to other world leaders that you want to see the debt restructured?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the details of the conversations that the President had with Chancellor Merkel beyond what I just told Jerome. \xc2\xa0For Secretary Lew\xe2\x80\x99s comments, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see them firsthand, but based on the significant number of conversations that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had with him over the last several days about these issues, it strikes me that those comments that you\xe2\x80\x99ve read are consistent with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about the need for an agreement around a package of reforms and financing that would put Greece back on a path to both economic growth and debt sustainability. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s that last factor that Secretary Lew was apparently emphasizing in at least that part of his remarks this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Three high-profile glitches all in one day affecting some pretty major institutions in this country -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not suspicious?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, what I can tell you is that our professionals have looked at this and, more importantly, the information technology professionals at the New York Stock Exchange, at United Airlines and the Wall Street Journal have been looking at this, too. \xc2\xa0And what I can tell you is that as it relates to at least the New York Stock Exchange and United Airlines, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication at this point of any sort of malicious activity being responsible for the technical issues that they\xe2\x80\x99ve endured today. \xc2\xa0I can also --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why come out so quickly and make that kind of statement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, we endeavor to share as much information as possible with the public. \xc2\xa0And in this case, this is what our experts have concluded. \xc2\xa0The other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important is that our experts have also concluded that the two incidents, both at the New York Stock Exchange and at United Airlines, are neither attributable to a malicious actor, they\xe2\x80\x99re also not related to each other. \xc2\xa0And these are just two separate incidents.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0High degree of confidence, you would say, inside this administration these are just glitches?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, that is the assessment of our folks who have taken a look at this. \xc2\xa0But obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to monitor this situation. \xc2\xa0I know that even as the situation at the New York Stock Exchange is something that\xe2\x80\x99s still being worked on, that I know that the SCC is closely monitoring their progress in trying to get the system back up and running.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you something about what Hillary Clinton said yesterday to CNN about her use of a private email server to conduct her correspondence while at the State Department. \xc2\xa0She said, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything I did was permitted. \xc2\xa0There was no law, there was no regulation, there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate. \xc2\xa0Previous Secretaries of State have said they did the same thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Is that true? \xc2\xa0All that true?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, what we have focused on is the --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know, but is that true? \xc2\xa0Is that a true statement? \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no law, there was no regulation, there was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Fact check -- true? \xc2\xa0Mostly true?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reason to contradict what Secretary Clinton has said. \xc2\xa0What we have focused on is the need for those communications to be properly archived and maintained at the agency so that they can be responsive to requests from the public or from Congress for that information. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Clinton has done by taking the emails that were contained on her private server and forwarding those that were related to her official business as Secretary of State to the State Department so that they could be used to respond to requests for information from Congress or the public. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Secretary Clinton did take the extraordinary step of suggesting that the State Department shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just release those emails that are relevant to specific requests, but rather that they should work to declassify and release all of that information. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the State Department is doing, consistent with her request, and consistent with the priority that this administration has placed on transparency.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what lessons would you say have been learned, though, through this whole controversy regarding her emails, do you think? \xc2\xa0Are there any lessons to be learned about how she handled this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s a question that you guys could have asked in the interview. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, it\xe2\x80\x99s your administration, so I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you if the administration feels there have been any lessons that have been learned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, none that I can think of, I guess.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should a future Secretary of State be able to conduct his or her business in that fashion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Jim, what we have told everybody -- whether they\xe2\x80\x99re the Secretary of State or they\xe2\x80\x99re somebody answering the phone for the Secretary of State -- that they should use their official government email account for official government business. \xc2\xa0And in those instances where they don\xe2\x80\x99t, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the information or the business that\xe2\x80\x99s transacted on a personal email system or on a private email server is then shared with the State Department so that information can be properly archived. \xc2\xa0And, again, based on everything I know about this situation, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Secretary Clinton did.</p>\n<p>\n\tBob.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can you give us a readout of the meeting last night with the Senate Democrats, particularly vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the Iran talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Bob, this was an opportunity for the President to spend some time talking to Senate Democrats about some of his legislative priorities and to take some questions from those who attended. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that at the end of his remarks yesterday, the President had an opportunity to update the gathering of Democratic senators on the current status of the talks on Vienna. \xc2\xa0But the truth is the update that he gave them is not a whole lot different than the updates that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sharing with you over the last several days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was Senator Schumer there, do you know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was there. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m sure his office would be happy to confirm for you one way or the other.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he spoke one-on-one with anybody who had particular concerns about Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up real quick and then ask a question? \xc2\xa0Can you just describe the format? \xc2\xa0The President -- this was a reception. \xc2\xa0It was in the -- can you just describe the setting? \xc2\xa0And then he spoke to them and he took questions -- or not? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, but the way that it was described to me was that it was a working reception -- which I observed to somebody sounds like the worst of both worlds. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sounds like Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess it does. \xc2\xa0I guess it does. \xc2\xa0But I think the reason it was described that way is that there was food and drink that was served, but the principal focus of the event was the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and then an opportunity for him to take questions from the assembled group. \xc2\xa0And I do think that the President had the opportunity to spend a little time with members one-on-one afterwards in a less formal way. \xc2\xa0I know that there were some Cabinet officials and White House officials who were there as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just related to that, did they talk at any length about their ambition -- shared ambition to gain seats in the Senate in the next election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think what they were focused on was the legislative priorities. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if there was an extensive discussion of politics or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, 200 or so state, local jurisdictions that have enacted laws or policies to not cooperate with DHS, with immigration -- San Francisco being one. And the term is often called \xe2\x80\x9csanctuary city.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does the President approve of or embrace those cities and communities that have adopted these policies or laws?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Alexis, one of the important executive actions that the President announced back in November was a significant change to the Secure Communities program. \xc2\xa0And the Secure Communities program was essentially the way that -- it was essentially the program that codified the relationship between local law enforcement authorities and federal immigration enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there was lots of dissatisfaction I think on both ends of that relationship about the Secure Communities program. \xc2\xa0And so what the President announced back in November was essentially an overhaul of that system. \xc2\xa0He threw out the Secure Communities program and put in place something called the Priority Enforcement program that was designed to improve coordination and allow local jurisdictions to exercise more flexibility in working with the federal government on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President did that -- undertook that change with an eye toward making sure that we\'re concentrating our limited federal law enforcement assets on deporting criminals, those who pose a threat to the community and those who may pose a threat to national security. \xc2\xa0And too often, we saw a broken immigration system that allowed those enforcement resources to be diluted by being focused on essentially hardworking people who were just trying to provide for their families and that it resulted in a situation where every bit as much attention was focused on separating families as deporting felons. \xc2\xa0And the President didn\'t believe that that made a lot of sense. \xc2\xa0It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t consistent with the kinds of values that we hold dear in this country and it certainly is not consistent with a common-sense assessment about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to best protect the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so this Priority Enforcement program was put in place to improve the coordination between state -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, between federal and local law enforcement, and make sure that these law enforcement resources were being focused on the greatest need, which is deporting those individuals that pose the greatest threat to communities across the country or to the country itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So back to the situation in San Francisco recently that was much in the news. \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that the sheriff in San Francisco made a mistake, or it should have been handled differently? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s his feeling now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as it relates to this specific case, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to be able to talk about the specific details of this matter. \xc2\xa0But the Department of Homeland Security may be able to share more with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Earlier this morning, in a national security speech, Senator Lindsey Graham was talking about immigration, but on a different subject. \xc2\xa0He was talking about comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate. \xc2\xa0And as you know, he was one of the leaders who did try to pass the bill that the President had supported at that time. \xc2\xa0But he said today that the President didn\'t lift a finger when he came into office. \xc2\xa0In 2009, he could have tried to help pass comprehensive immigration reform then, but he didn\'t lift a -- d-a-m-n -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I can say that word in here -- (laughter) -- d-a-m-n finger is actually what he said. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0This is a PG-13 briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There you go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I just wanted to get your take on that and see if you felt that characterization was accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not accurate. \xc2\xa0I think what is a fair assessment of the situation is the general recognition that when this President took office in 2009, this country was facing an historic recession and, in fact, our country was on the verge of a second Great Depression. \xc2\xa0And that\'s where the President concentrated his policy focus.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd by focusing as much as he did on trying to rescue the U.S. economy, we actually see the fruits of that labor -- that we are now in the midst of the strongest continuous streak of job growth in this country in history. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the importance of those early efforts, but also to the success of that effort by the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that, in 2013, the President made clear -- shortly after the election -- that immigration reform would be a priority. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that in early January of 2013, the President traveled to Las Vegas where he delivered a speech vowing to work closely with Democrats and Republicans to bring together a bipartisan package of common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform that would be in the best interests of our national security and the best interests of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s what this administration did. \xc2\xa0We worked closely with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate -- including Senator Graham, to his credit. \xc2\xa0He was an effective partner with the administration on this. \xc2\xa0And that essentially led to a breakthrough in the Senate that we saw a piece of legislation get nearly 70 votes for a common-sense package of immigration reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the President didn\'t believe that that was a perfect piece of legislation, but it did generally reflect a bipartisan agreement and would make a substantial difference in improving border security. \xc2\xa0It made a historic investment in border security. \xc2\xa0But it also imposed some reforms to our immigration system that would have been good for our economy, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, despite the fact that everybody who looked at this -- just about everybody who looked at this, at least -- concluded that there was majority support for this legislation in the House of Representatives, the House Republican leadership made a conscious decision to not allow this common-sense, bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate to come up for a vote in the House. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we do continue to deal with a broken immigration system. And that quite simply is the fault of House Republicans who blocked a common-sense measure that would have improved the program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0But quickly going back to 2009, which was what the Senator was specifically talking about, you\'re not necessarily disagreeing that the President didn\'t focus on that back in 2009. \xc2\xa0It sounded like to me you were saying that he didn\'t have time, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0He was busy with the economy. \xc2\xa0That\'s not necessarily to say that Senator Graham is entirely wrong in his take.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, to suggest that the President didn\'t do anything on immigration reform in early 2009 is false. The President was a strong supporter of immigration reform then. But what also is a fact is the President had a significant crisis on his hands in terms of the state of the U.S. economy at the time that he took office, and that is what he was focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, the only reason that we don\'t have common-sense immigration reform right now that would be good for national security, that would be good for public safety, that would be good for our economy, that would be good for deficit reduction, is because House Republicans made a cynical, political decision to block it. \xc2\xa0And that\'s unfortunate, but it is a fact of life.<br/>\n\tAnd it sounds like Senator Graham has the same lament that I do in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:35 P.M.
