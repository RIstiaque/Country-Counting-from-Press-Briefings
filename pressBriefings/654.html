EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Jacksonville, Florida, where the President will tour the local port and deliver some remarks lifting up the themes that he laid out in his address in Galesburg, Illinois yesterday afternoon.</p>\n<p>As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, the President discussed his vision for making the kinds of key investments that will strengthen the middle class, because that\xe2\x80\x99s what leads -- because a strong middle class, in the view of the President, is the engine of our national economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, today, he\xe2\x80\x99ll point out how his vision for the economy contrasts deeply with the priorities championed by congressional Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Right now, House Republicans are working to pass legislation that would dangerously undermine the kind of investments that stand to benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 From Pell grants to housing to, of course, health care reform, House Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t just have the wrong answers for middle-class families, they\xe2\x80\x99re not even asking the right questions that will ensure that middle-class families get a better bargain, including from infrastructure projects that have historically received and actually deserve bipartisan support, like the infrastructure projects that are underway in Jacksonville and at the Jacksonville Port, I should say.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why you heard the President say in direct terms yesterday that he will not sign a budget deal that hurts middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 So with that preview from what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President today, we\xe2\x80\x99ll open it for questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The DOJ is asking Texas to get federal permission before changing their voting rules for the next decade.\xc2\xa0 Is this an attempt by the administration to make an end run around the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those of you have been covering politics for the last 15 years or so -- and Todd will have special knowledge of this -- understand that the district lines that have been drawn in Texas have attracted quite a bit of controversy down there.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise to anybody who has been following this that that\xe2\x80\x99s attracted the attention of the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s scrutiny and examination of this issue, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the Attorney General is delivering some remarks on this today, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those remarks for a full accounting of our view on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fact that the administration is going to try to reinstate preclearance through the courts, is that a concession that there will be no remedy through Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 I actually think that -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some public comments from members of Congress from both parties about the Voting Rights Act and about the best way to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the constitutional rights of Americans and certainly protecting the voting rights of all those Americans who are eligible to vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation about that in Congress, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a role for the administration to play in that conversation, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly play it.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the legal strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s being pursued by the Attorney General, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the remarks that he\xe2\x80\x99s delivering today, and any technical questions they may be able to answer for you at the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are other Texas officials, apart from the end run around the Supreme Court, who accused the administration of bullying and of pursuing a partisan agenda in pursuing this legal strategy.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would say is the goal of the administration -- and the Attorney General will make this clear -- is to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.\xc2\xa0 That includes protecting the voting rights of all Americans who are eligible to vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the goal here.\xc2\xa0 And I would assume that that would be a goal that would also be supported by congressional Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the past 24 hours, has the U.S. received any more clarity from Russia on the status of Edward Snowden?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there are a number of ongoing conversations between Obama administration officials and Russian officials.\xc2\xa0 I know that the State Department has read out a conversation between the Secretary of State and his counterpart, Mr. Lavrov.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador McFaul has been engaged in a number of conversations over the last several weeks on this issue.\xc2\xa0 At this point, the Russian authorities, neither publicly nor in private, have made clear exactly the status of Mr. Snowden.</p>\n<p>But I can tell you that we continue to believe that it would be quite disappointing if Mr. Snowden were allowed to leave the airport.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is clear, is that there is a justification for Mr. Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s return to the U.S. to face the criminal charges that have been filed against him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans control the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 Why is the President giving speeches criticizing the Republicans, instead of sitting down with them and trying to\xc2\xa0 compromise on achieving a budget deal that will get him at least some of what he wants?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The President has spent an inordinate amount of time, some might even say, negotiating with Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill to try to find some consensus, to try to find some common ground about what should be some pretty basic economic principles about supporting the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority.\xc2\xa0 That is the reason that he ran for President in the first place.\xc2\xa0 It has been at the top of his agenda throughout his first term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>His vision for strengthening the middle class was the core of his reelection campaign -- reelection campaign that he won with a strong majority.\xc2\xa0 And it continues to be something that he will pursue throughout his second term in office.\xc2\xa0 There should be no mistaking that.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that an important part of his job is to make sure that that debate doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just take place in Washington, D.C., but that the American people should be involved in that debate.</p>\n<p>And by traveling across the country and laying out his vision for how best to accomplish those priorities is an important part of his job.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not at all a replacement for important conversations that can take place on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And the President will engage in those as well.\xc2\xa0 And you heard the President talk about that quite a bit yesterday; he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about it again today.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve heard that the President is going to travel to Tennessee early next week where he\'ll talk about this some more.</p>\n<p>So this is going to be part of a sustained effort by the President and our administration to make the case for critical investments that are so important to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just simply the view of the President and this administration that having a strong and vibrant middle class is key to ensuring that we have a -- we continue to have a strong economy.</p>\n<p>Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to share that point of view.\xc2\xa0 So we want to engage in that debate, and we\'re hopeful that it will lead to some congressional action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I guess the last thing I\'ll say is this:\xc2\xa0 We should be able to find common ground here.\xc2\xa0 This reflects -- the speeches and the argument that the President is going to be making over the course of several weeks doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect his view that we can\'t get anything done in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We should be able to get something done in Washington.\xc2\xa0 These should be common-sense principles that the vast majority of Americans agree on.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s something that the vast majority of members of Congress should be able to agree on.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s what\'s animating the President\'s desire to have a national debate about this and a national conversation about the best way to make progress on the priorities that the President has identified.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just skip to Egypt for a second.\xc2\xa0 General al-Sisi has called for demonstrations to prevent further sort of terrorism and that sort of thing.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that the military is increasingly stepping in to try to influence events and that this is much more like a military coup than anybody would like to say that it is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just say that, as it regards to -- as it relates to General al-Sisi\'s speech, that the Obama administration is concerned by any rhetoric that inflames tensions and could possibly lead to more violence.\xc2\xa0 This is a critical time for Egyptians to come together if they want to -- particularly if they want to move beyond cycles of unrest and instability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this administration urges the security forces to exercise maximum restraint and caution, and to do their utmost to prevent any clashes between opposing demonstrators.\xc2\xa0 And we reiterate our call for protestors to demonstrate peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, also on Egypt, the four F-16s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not delivering them -- is that more of a motivation to do something different, or a punishment for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It simply is a conclusion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn that it would not be appropriate at this time to move forward with the delivery of the F-16s.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve stated publicly that it is our view, it is the view of the administration, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of the United States of America for us to make significant changes to our assistance to Egypt at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as it relates to the F-16s, we have determined that it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate right now for that delivery to move forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to review our obligations under the law, as it relates to all of this, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that officials in Egypt will continue to take the steps necessary to expeditiously move toward a democratically elected government in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if those steps aren\xe2\x80\x99t taken, should they expect the rest of the F-16s to be delivered, and those four that already -- that they are owed?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in a number of conversations at a number of different levels with Egyptian officials.\xc2\xa0 And part of that message is the reiteration of our view that they should move expeditiously back in the direction of democratically elected government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, Interpol called the escape of 500 prisoners from an Iraqi prison a major threat to global security.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. share that assessment?\xc2\xa0 And are we -- what steps are being taken to contain that threat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports, but I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to your question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with my colleagues back in Washington and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you an answer when we land.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, the U.N. has now increased the expected death count there to 100,000.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to that news?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 I know that Secretary Kerry is in New York today for meetings with leaders of the Syrian Opposition Council.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear for some time now that the horrific violence in Syria is something that needs to stop.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about the humanitarian toll that the strife there has already taken on the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s already starting to have a destabilizing impact on other countries in the region, because they\xe2\x80\x99re being forced to bear the weight of refugees, people who have been forced to flee their homes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing there is a terrible situation.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has been engaged for some time in offering humanitarian assistance to those who have been affected by the violence, but also working with our allies and partners in the region to try and bring this to an end.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify on when Obama is talking today about not being open to any budget deal that hits these programs you were talking about, you\xe2\x80\x99re referring specifically to preserving the sequester cuts, is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I referred to in my opening remarks, and I think what you can expect to hear the President discuss a little bit more today are some of the appropriations bills that are moving through the House of Representatives right now -- that there are a couple of committees that have passed a couple of these measures on party-line votes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And like I said, those bills aren\xe2\x80\x99t just the wrong answer for the middle class, they\xe2\x80\x99re actually asking the wrong question.\xc2\xa0 There are ways that we can offer assistance and make important investments that benefit the middle class without threatening our nation\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal condition.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually taken important steps over the last two or three years to get our deficits on a decline -- on a rapid decline.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, they are falling as quickly as they have at any time since the end of World War II.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress in reducing our deficits.\xc2\xa0 We need to start asking questions now about what we can do to strengthen the middle class in this country and make the kinds of investments, in a fiscally responsible way, that will benefit middle-class families not just immediately, but over the long term; that we want to make sure that economic opportunity exists for the middle class so that we can have another generation of Americans who can live a life in middle class; who can buy a home and put a roof over the heads of their family; who can go to college and get the training that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to get a good job in a 21st century global economy; who can retire with some stability.\xc2\xa0 You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be rich just to be able to enjoy your retirement and not have to worry about your finances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So these are the cornerstones to a middle-class life that the President is going to be talking about.\xc2\xa0 And what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to observe today is that these cornerstones are being undermined by some of the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s being contemplated by Republicans in the House right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where does the President put this middle-class agenda on his list of priorities compared to things like immigration or gun control, some of things where he seems to be stymied so far in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would agree with your characterization of immigration reform being stymied.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of success.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of progress and had a lot of success in building bipartisan support for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it gets such strong bipartisan support in the Senate.</p>\n<p>Now, I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make this case to you; the Congressional Budget Office did a perfectly good job of making the case that comprehensive immigration reform would actually do something important for our economy, would be a big boost to our economy, and would benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we would view the passage of comprehensive immigration reform as something that would benefit middle-class families, and would fall cleanly in line with the case that the President is making now.</p>\n<p>As it relates to some of the gun safety measures that were debated in the Congress earlier this year, those are measures that continue to have the President\'s steadfast support.\xc2\xa0 Those are measures that continue to have pretty strong bipartisan support -- unfortunately, not enough bipartisan support to make their way through the Congress.\xc2\xa0 But the President\'s support for those measures has not abated at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s reports that next week sometime Israeli and Palestinian officials will be in Washington to begin talks.\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan on marking those talks in any way, becoming involved in them directly in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to read out now in terms of the President\'s involvement in those talks.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if a date on those has been set.\xc2\xa0 I know that we\'re anticipating those happening sometime pretty soon.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly welcome the beginning of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything to say right now about presidential involvement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, several senators have said that they won\'t approve any spending bills that contain funding for the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 In that kind of an environment on the Hill, how can the President hope to get his priorities, like spending on infrastructure, approved?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I also know that there are a couple of Republican lawmakers that have been pretty dismissive of that perspective.\xc2\xa0 So that may be something that Republicans can sit down and have a conversation and figure out themselves.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve been pretty clear that it makes no sense, A, for Republicans to threaten a shutdown of the federal government.\xc2\xa0 That would suck a lot of the momentum out of our nascent economic recovery.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there\'s no reason that Washington should be in the business of throwing up obstacles to our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President believes that Washington should be in the business of trying to figure out what we can do to actually make it easier for the private sector to continue to lead our recovery in the right direction.</p>\n<p>But in terms of trying to defund the Affordable Care Act, that is just an effort to re-litigate and refight the political battles that were waged and won many years ago.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court has spoken on this, and even the Republican Speaker of the House has noted that Obamacare is the law of the land.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'re ready to get down to business and focus on a conversation with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill that\'s constructive, that will actually lead to investments that are critical to middle-class families and critical to our economy.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll see you on the ground.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:08 P.M.
