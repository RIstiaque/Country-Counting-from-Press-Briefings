EDT</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, and welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Albany, New York.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday President Obama is traveling, as you know, to the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering NanoTech Complex in Albany to call on Congress to act on a "To-Do" list that will create jobs and help restore middle-class security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese initiatives have bipartisan support and at this make-or-break moment for the middle class, we need to create an economy built to last that creates secure American jobs and makes things the rest of the world buys -- not one built on outsourcing, loopholes, or risky financial deals.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou all have the paper on it.\xc2\xa0 You know what the "To-Do" list contains.\xc2\xa0 But I will entertain questions on that and other subjects.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he going to do I guess as part of the "To-Do" list, rather than just present it to Congress? Is he going to do these more events --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear him talking about this frequently in the days and weeks ahead because these are the kinds of initiatives that traditionally enjoy bipartisan support. They\'re the kinds of initiatives that outside independent economists have identified as things that would have an immediate impact on economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s an important distinction with some of the proposals put forward by House Republicans, which outside economists have uniformly said would not have either any positive economic impact or certainly not any positive economic impact in the near term.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve had 26 straight months of positive private sector job growth, more than 4 million jobs created in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 But we are still a long way from where we need to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to keep the economy moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 We need to keep it growing.\xc2\xa0 And the President today will talk about the need to encourage insourcing; the need to provide incentives for businesses to bring jobs back to the United States rather than support of tax incentives like many Republicans do -- support for tax incentives that encourage businesses to outsource jobs and move business overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is -- both the item that he\'s highlighting today and all the items on the "To-Do" list are the kinds of things that should garner bipartisan support if there\'s a willingness to focus on the economic needs of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Governor Cuomo going to be at this event?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe he will, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still consider this to be a do-nothing Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President believes that this Congress needs to do a lot more.\xc2\xa0 It is the case, as I\'ve mentioned over the last several weeks, that because of the focus and pressure that this President has put on a number of issues, that Congress has come together and acted on some important measures, like extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance, like passing the STOCK Act and the JOBS Act.\xc2\xa0 But there is still much more that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned yesterday, it is notable, as I\'m sure you all know, that when you look at the charts that measure job creation and compare the recovery from this recession to the recoveries from all of the previous recession for the past 30 or 40 years, what is notable is the significant job loss in the public sector. And as we know, a lot of that has been done -- has come about in the education arena, where many teachers have been laid off by state and local governments.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes very strongly that we need to have those teachers in our classroom because of the need for education as a foundation of our economic growth, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he put in the American Jobs Act the provision that would have put 400,000 teachers back in the classrooms.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans opposed that.\xc2\xa0 They chose tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans over putting teachers back in the classroom, and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, gas prices have been declining in the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Has that stolen the GOP thunder that we\'ve heard in the past few weeks?\xc2\xa0 And second, does it lessen the chances of a triggering of the withdrawal of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no news for you on the SPR.\xc2\xa0 I can say that the President remains focused intensely on the need to promote an all-of-the-above approach to our energy demands.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made clear at the time when the Republicans were trying to make hay out of this that there was no silver bullet solution to the problems of sustained high prices in the oil markets, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you had to have this kind of comprehensive approach that he has put forward and has been working on since the day he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think there\'s no better evidence than the fact that a modest drop in prices at the pump has brought about a change in talking points from the Republicans that they weren\'t serious about comprehensive solutions to our energy problems, they were just trying to score political points.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the price at the pump, while it\'s lower now than it was at this time last year, is still high.\xc2\xa0 It still poses a burden for Americans trying to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is not going to drop this issue.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to continue to focus on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s a new coalition government in Israel.\xc2\xa0 How does the President view this coalition?\xc2\xa0 Does he see it as offering a pathway to peace with the Palestinians?\xc2\xa0 Or does he make -- but also on the Iran issue, is it more likely to see Israel strike Iran, given this coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our positions on both of those issues haven\'t changed.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Israelis and the Palestinians need to take steps towards peace.\xc2\xa0 They need to refrain from actions that make it harder to reach the kind of -- well, to reach the negotiating table where they can work on a solution that still needs to be found.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Iran, our position is as it was, which is we absolutely share Israel\'s concern about the threat posed by Iran\'s nuclear ambitions.\xc2\xa0 We have pursued a policy approach that has effectively isolated Iran and united the world in identifying Iran\'s behavior as the problem.\xc2\xa0 And we have, through sanctions and other means, made clear to the Iranians that there is a high price to pay for their refusal to abide by their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 That process has led to a restart of the P5-plus-1 talks, and we look forward to the second round of those discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see the coalition, though, the new coalition changing the equation on either of those issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s certainly -- a new coalition government in Israel certainly will not affect our policy approach, and we continue to have very good relations with leaders in Israel and we have significant support for -- we provide significant support for and coordination with Israel\'s military on security interests, and share a lot of information when it comes to intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And we work very closely with the Israelis on the Iran issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the gay marriage issue, Jay, has the intensity of interest in this and the statements from some of the President\'s supporters led him to consider clarifying his position?\xc2\xa0 And considering that his views are evolving, does he want to maybe consider his views more thoroughly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a readout of any conversations involving the President on that issue.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that I\'m sure it is the case that he will be asked again at some point when he gives interviews or press conferences about this issue, and I\'ll leave it to him to describe his personal views.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\'s important to note, as I attempted to do yesterday, that what is abundantly clear is this President\'s firm commitment to the protection of and securing of the same rights and obligations for LGBT citizens as other Americans enjoy.\xc2\xa0 He has been a strong proponent of LGBT rights, and I think that\'s demonstrated by his record, which is unparalleled, as President in support of those rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said yesterday on this issue in reference to Vice President Biden\'s remarks and the President\'s, that the President\'s personal views obviously were evolving, and you stressed the personal views.\xc2\xa0 I guess is there maybe a disconnect between his policies and his personal views in terms of maybe his policies are ahead of his personal views on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s absolute commitment to the rights of LGBT citizens demonstrated by the path he took to ensure the repeal of "don\'t ask, don\'t tell," the opposition that he and his administration have expressed towards DOMA and the fact that he believes it ought to be repealed.\xc2\xa0 It is also the case that the President and the Attorney General believe that Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional, which is why the federal government no longer defends Section 3.\xc2\xa0 And from hate crimes legislation to hospital visitation rights, the list of accomplishments is quite long and I think demonstrates his feelings about, broadly, this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\'ll talk about it with Cuomo considering he\'s received a lot of plaudits from the LGBT community?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their conversations will contain.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\'ll focus on the issue that the President has come to discuss in upstate New York. I think the President has taken a position on some of these state issues, and I think he did on New York and he has in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 And I think the position he takes has -- the positions he has taken are consistent with his belief that it is wrong to take actions that would deny rights to LGBT citizens or rescind rights already provided to LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a position that you can fully expect him to maintain.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that he\'ll address at all -- I know we got statements yesterday, but the Yemeni al Qaeda plot, do you think he will address that at all in his remarks today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect him to address that issue in his remarks.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I will say that he\'s certainly pleased with the success of our intelligence and counterterrorism officials in foiling the attempt by al Qaeda to use this explosive device.\xc2\xa0 It is indicative of the kind of work that our intelligence and counterterrorism services are performing regularly to counter the threat posed by al Qaeda in general, and AQAP in particular.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he was regularly -- as you know, he was made aware of this development in early April and he was regularly briefed on it by John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 At no time were Americans in danger as a result of this, and, as you know, we were able to foil the attempt to use this device.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any evidence that the explosive device could have evaded airport screeners, that it was designed in such a way to do so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This device was similar to other devices that have been out there and others have attempted to use.\xc2\xa0 We are constantly adjusting our -- the measures that we take to counter threats like this in the aviation industry.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why there\'s a multilayered approach to security -- aviation security at airports and on aircraft.\xc2\xa0 And I think, again, this is indicative of the multifaceted approach that we take in dealing with the threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President had any reaction to the death of Maurice Sendak --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I was just with him and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\'s aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll ask him.\xc2\xa0 I know, as any --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if his daughters read the book?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they have, and I know every parent must be a little bit in mourning today and every child who grew up with that book.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a sad day.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:39 A.M.
