EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How are you guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m good.\xc2\xa0 I\'m good.\xc2\xa0 A little worn out, but that\'s par for the course.\xc2\xa0 Fire away.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of David Kellermann, and has he -- what are his thoughts on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of David Kellermann\'s apparent suicide, and his thoughts on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about that.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that -- I don\'t have any comment on it as the police look into the matter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any clarity from yesterday on the President\'s position on torture memos, and any reaction to Dennis Blair\'s memo that appeared in papers today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first question, what exactly -- what clarity are you looking for?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re looking -- you said you were going to talk to -- get back to us with clarity on the President\'s remarks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what -- maybe what I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear about yesterday and -- because what was said yesterday was exactly what the President has said for not just the past week, as we\'ve dealt with these OLC memos, but for the past many months.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s just go through the whole sort of decision in general.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President, at the beginning of his administration, banned the use of enhanced interrogation techniques because he believed they were -- they opposed our values and, on balance, they made the country less safe.\xc2\xa0 As part of an ongoing legal proceeding, the President released these memos because there was no legal justification for continuing to keep them classified; that a lot of the information that was contained in the memos, that the types of techniques were in the public domain.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So that is part of the backdrop of where we are.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes that the memos and their release should be a moment for us to reflect, but not a moment for retribution. The President, as he said yesterday, has a lot on his plate and he believes that our focus looking forward should be on the crises that we have in the bank industry, in unemployment, the financial sector, and as he and the Attorney General have said, that while no one is above the law, those that worked within the four corners of the legal advice they were given, and those that acted in good faith based on the advice they were provided should not be subject to interrogation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">That\'s what the President said -- that\'s what the President has said all along.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should not be subject to what?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should not be subject to prosecution.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said yesterday that he wanted to ensure that if there was any kind of investigation, politics were not part of the equation.\xc2\xa0 Given that, would he be supportive at some point appointing a special prosecutor to look into these Bush-era officials?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this goes into the -- in some ways, the non-clarity of yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Let me use an example. If you go in the back of the plane, Air Force One, and spray-paint the walls and smoke in the bathroom, the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to determine whether you broke the law; a legal official is going to determine whether you broke the law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the determination that will be made in any instance whereby anybody knowingly breaks the law.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But due to the fact that his AG, Eric Holder, is a political appointee, would it not be less political to have a prosecutor to look into these issues?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that the lawyers that are involved are plenty capable of determining whether any law has been broken.\xc2\xa0 I want to stress that that determination is not going to be made by the President, or the Vice President, or anybody that works in the White House, because that\'s why many, many, many, many moons ago we created a Department of Justice.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To switch gears, can you tell us a little bit more about this planned summit with Zardari and Karzai?\xc2\xa0 What does the President hope to achieve with this, what I understand is going to be a three-way?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it will be a trilateral meeting in early May.\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously, without getting into a lot of the technical details, these are -- this is part of the ongoing new policy and process that was put into place at the conclusion of the review of where we are in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Understanding that this is a very important and very dangerous part of the world, the President wants to be personally involved, as he has been throughout his administration, in seeking to find solutions to the problems that are in this region and to protect the United States.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said before that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that they\'re not going to have a blank check.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he\'s going to communicate to them again when he meets them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t -- the President will reiterate his hopes and his belief of the opportunities, but also the responsibilities that each leader has.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are lots and lots of news reports today saying that what the President did yesterday was open the door, change his policy, make a surprising announcement.\xc2\xa0 Are all of those stories just flat wrong?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And let me -- again, I\'ll use the example that I used with Jonathan to you -- I think you were getting a pen or something.\xc2\xa0 If you spray-paint the back of this plane, if you tear up one of the seats, even though it\'s Air Force One, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a determination as to who broke the law.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a legal official.\xc2\xa0 The notion that the President is open to anything is -- I think misses the point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">If somebody knowingly broke the law, that\'s a determination that will be ultimately made by a legal official, not by the President of the United States, or not by anybody else.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic.\xc2\xa0 On the panel, or whatever it would be, to look into this, no change in his position yesterday?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he said quite clearly in the transcript that he\'s not proposing this.\xc2\xa0 Again, there have been --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But everybody is reporting he left the door open to it.\xc2\xa0 Is that wrong?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- well, maybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t read as clearly as I did the notion that -- the words, "I\'m not proposing this."\xc2\xa0 Because what he\'s saying -- he was asked, what about these commissions, and he said if Congress were to decide to set one up, it has to be done outside of the realm of politics.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And that\'s the truth -- that\'s why he believes that these memos and the release of these memos provide a moment of reflection, not of retribution; that the President believes that we have to look forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s I think what he said Thursday, Monday and yesterday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that he\'s not pushing for one of those commissions, but that he did yesterday outline what he would like to see were one of those created, would he be open to pursuing not just torture but also questions relating to rendition, wiretaps, sort of Bush-era issues besides torture?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, despite the fact that I think I was pretty clear that he wasn\'t proposing this, the hypothetical -- the hypothetical of the fact that he wasn\'t -- might propose what he didn\'t propose, leaving aside all of those exceedingly large number of caveats, again, the President I think stated once again yesterday that he\'s looking forward.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the number of topics on his plate each and every day, the many crises that face this country and this administration, we\'re all better served looking forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the op-ed piece by Secretary Chu and Solis was pretty tough about making polluters pay -- it was pretty tough about making polluters pay.\xc2\xa0 Is that a reference to how you\'re going to handle cap-and-trade?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I think the notion of a cap-and-trade system is to provide a monetary incentive for renewable energy, similar to what the Northeast did in the \'80s, late \'80s and early \'90s dealing with acid rain, that you put a price on pollution because we know that there\'s a negative economic consequence to it, and that you reduce the level of that cap, thus providing incentives for people to find ways to conduct their activities while producing less pollution.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a market-based system that has worked in the past and can work in the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the initial credits are going to come with a price tag, or may the initial credits be free?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The initial -- the outline -- the President\'s plan outlined in the campaign would monetize those credits on the front end.\xc2\xa0 But I think what\'s important and what you\'ll see today -- as a little background -- I think a little bit on the trip today, you know, you\'ve got a manufacturing facility, a former Maytag manufacturing facility in Newton that closed up shop and now is producing valuable parts for wind turbines that -- if you take a look at some of the statistics, Iowa now is the second largest wind producer in the nation.\xc2\xa0 About half of their -- a little more than half of their wind-making capacity was added just last year.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">This plant has hired some former Maytag employees.\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking to probably expand, based on the incentives that the recovery plan provides to further make wind energy cost-effective.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think there are many messages that when we move to a clean energy economy, when we reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we\'re creating the jobs of the future.\xc2\xa0 We\'re taking care of not just our energy problems but we\'re dealing with our economic security.\xc2\xa0 And I think today is a perfect backdrop and the site is a perfect backdrop to demonstrate that clean energy means good jobs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to the other.\xc2\xa0 Is he spending time today dealing with the fallout from the interrogation issue yesterday?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean, "the fallout from" --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of talk on Capitol Hill; Blair had his memo that he -- statement that he put out today.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\'s -- in Washington, it\'s an issue that\'s dominating the scene today.\xc2\xa0 Is he dealing with any of that fallout?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- in Iowa dealing with wind energy and the economy.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s what I would say about -- I mean, I would point you to the statement that the Director of DNI put out about this, and understand, as I said earlier, that on balance this has not made our country safer, that the costs were extraordinary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken with Dennis Blair about the memo?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I could check.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that -- I don\'t believe that\'s the case.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other thing, just -- on the plane today, Ellen Moran, but she won\'t -- she won\'t be with the White House much longer.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about that a little bit?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you guys asked me how I was doing when I came back here and my first answer was that I was worn out.\xc2\xa0 She had the opportunity to go work as the chief of staff for the Commerce -- the new Commerce Secretary.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a position that greatly interests her and it gives her a chance to spend more time with her husband and her children.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I don\'t doubt that we\'re all in many ways uniquely jealous of the opportunity to continue being a public servant at a level as high as that, but at the same time, having more time to see your family.\xc2\xa0 I saw my son last night, but it was about 11:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 So I can understand what that means.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final thing.\xc2\xa0 But on the IMF revised numbers for growth, drastically revised and the economy contracted, has the President seen those?\xc2\xa0 What are you guys\' reaction to those numbers?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not gotten to that, but let me -- I\'ll take a look at that; we\'ll talk about it on the way home.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last Iowa question.\xc2\xa0 What does it mean for the President coming back here for the first time since being sworn in, the state that sort of started it all for him?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, Iowa will always be a special place for the President and a special place for those that spent, I think we figured, one out of every three or four days in 2007 here.\xc2\xa0 The President and I were joking that we had no idea you could come to Iowa and just do one stop and go home. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 A normal day for most of 2007 --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you guilty at all in that -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Completely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Most days were anywhere from four to seven stops and a hotel room that you rarely unpacked in because all you wanted to do was go to sleep.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, I mean, I do think it is -- I think Iowa is a place that has, with a lot of different renewable energy, has in many ways led the way for this country, whether it was first in biofuels and now in wind energy.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you think about the recent -- they\'re number two in wind production; they now exceed California, a state that is obviously far, far bigger.\xc2\xa0 But the investments that the leaders in Iowa made -- Governor Vilsack is on the plane with us -- I think are a testament to a state that was looking forward not just to help the country become more energy independent, but to help its people get jobs when more traditional manufacturing was leaving.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But the truth is, we\'ll never be able to -- we\'ll never be able to go back to Iowa without thinking about all the hard work and all the fun we had here.\xc2\xa0 It was -- it was a memorable, memorable night, there\'s no question about it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  12:04 P.M.
