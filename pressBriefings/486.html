PDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Putin going to Normandy.\xc2\xa0 Any chances that the President would meet with him there?\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders.\xc2\xa0 This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II.\xc2\xa0 That will be the focal point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s there, he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate at this point that there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting between the President and President Putin at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel said today she welcomes Putin\xe2\x80\x99s presence there.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama feel the same way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p>\n<p>That will be the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Normandy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he actively going to avoid Putin?\xc2\xa0 I mean, would he even see him?\xc2\xa0 And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is still a month away here.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, and that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much.\xc2\xa0 And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will be doing when he\xe2\x80\x99s traveling to Normandy.\xc2\xa0 It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there was any advance notice of President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s plans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role.\xc2\xa0 So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation.\xc2\xa0 But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there\xe2\x80\x99s some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p>\n<p>The President has made clear that he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide.\xc2\xa0 There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to coordinate those efforts with the international community.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that\xe2\x80\x99s already hard at work on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not contemplating at this point an active military operation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn\xe2\x80\x99t designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall.\xc2\xa0 The President this week used stronger language saying that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there.\xc2\xa0 So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that?\xc2\xa0 And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also been a wide range of military assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been providing for some time to the Nigerians.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.\xc2\xa0 Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p>\n<p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 And that is a reflection of this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Are you all familiar with this?\xc2\xa0 And do you have a response to it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning.\xc2\xa0 If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital.\xc2\xa0 Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary.\xc2\xa0 Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he\xe2\x80\x99s a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President\xe2\x80\x99s passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p>\n<p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things.\xc2\xa0 The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation into what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happed there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s also been tremendous progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got quite a bit of work to do before that\xe2\x80\x99s happened.\xc2\xa0 But we have turned that tide.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s moving in the right direction.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on sequestration.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies.\xc2\xa0 Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off.\xc2\xa0 Any White House input on that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.</p>\n<p>So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \xe2\x80\x9cterrible toll\xe2\x80\x9d might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And again, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p>\n<p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at least for federal agencies, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as people were predicting.\xc2\xa0 So any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s according to one report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions.\xc2\xa0 And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service.\xc2\xa0 The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p>\n<p>So if there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they\xe2\x80\x99re going to convince many people of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign remarks last night.\xc2\xa0 He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year?\xc2\xa0 I know, obviously, always in campaigns he\xe2\x80\x99d say that.\xc2\xa0 Does he actually believe there\xe2\x80\x99s more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 He believes that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What gives him that belief?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because all the models and polling shows it\'s very, very unlikely.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me answer that question two ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats.\xc2\xa0 The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p>\n<p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President\xe2\x80\x99s name is at the top of the ballot.\xc2\xa0 And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President\xe2\x80\x99s name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p>\n<p>So the stakes are high, and we\'re going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more question about them.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can\'t do anything and split government and so forth.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about that?\xc2\xa0 It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p>\n<p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you\'re going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country.\xc2\xa0 The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we\'re going to be good citizens of this country it\'s going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country.\xc2\xa0 And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p>\n<p>So I\'m confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do.\xc2\xa0 I guess I\'m also confident that he\'ll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that.\xc2\xa0 How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \xe2\x80\x9csexy,\xe2\x80\x9d I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections.\xc2\xa0 And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p>\n<p>As the President laid out last night, there\xe2\x80\x99s a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified.\xc2\xa0 And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it\'s equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p>\n<p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don\'t talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it\'s mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they\xe2\x80\x99re targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012.\xc2\xa0 That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did.\xc2\xa0 And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll bear with me just one second.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNear the end of his remarks, the President said, \xe2\x80\x9cNone of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust.\xc2\xa0 The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience.\xc2\xa0 They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not always easy.\xc2\xa0 And one of the powerful things about Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren\xe2\x80\x99t clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the part you didn\xe2\x80\x99t read was, \xe2\x80\x9cI have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, \xe2\x80\x98drop by drop [by drop],\xe2\x80\x99 that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\tSo it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the point that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make.\xc2\xa0 I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you\xe2\x80\x99re waking up and there\xe2\x80\x99s a new thing that\xe2\x80\x99s coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world.\xc2\xa0 And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren\xe2\x80\x99t easy and even when they aren\xe2\x80\x99t clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p>\n<p>Now, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down.\xc2\xa0 This is an autonomous government.\xc2\xa0 But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down.\xc2\xa0 And just because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we should stop or give up.\xc2\xa0 It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there.\xc2\xa0 This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies.\xc2\xa0 I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been active on the immigration front.\xc2\xa0 With the amount of money that\xe2\x80\x99s concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of his efforts to -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p>\n<p>I think that, to go back to somebody\xe2\x80\x99s earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don\xe2\x80\x99t disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today\xe2\x80\x99s fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a sort of version of Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question, which is, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy?\xc2\xa0 It seems like it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a mix.\xc2\xa0 I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he\xe2\x80\x99s also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he can.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can.\xc2\xa0 But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now.\xc2\xa0 The FCC is a completely independent body, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a wide range of reasons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they\xe2\x80\x99re participating in the fundraisers, why it is they\xe2\x80\x99re in support of the President and Democrats in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ll find is they\xe2\x80\x99re broadly supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House feel?\xc2\xa0 Is this too much what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Is it enough that has been done?\xc2\xa0 Should she have talked more?\xc2\xa0 Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:21 A.M.
