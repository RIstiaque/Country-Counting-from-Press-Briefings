MST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 A very good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 It is an honor to host you, Mr. President, and the United States delegation.\xc2\xa0 On behalf of the Malaysian people, I extend to you our warmest greeting.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Normally, I would say selamat datang, which means \xe2\x80\x9cwelcome\xe2\x80\x9d in our language.\xc2\xa0 But since you grew up not far from here, you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the few leaders, world leaders, who will understand when I say selamat datang, sahabat saya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Forty-eight years ago, a United States President first stepped onto Malaysian soil.\xc2\xa0 Back then, TV was black and white. The Monkees were topping the U.S. charts with \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Train to Clarksville.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good song.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 And the \xe2\x80\x9cSound of Music\xe2\x80\x9d movie was winning Academy Awards.\xc2\xa0 Today, Mr. President, you see not rubber trees, as Lyndon B. Johnson did, but soaring skyscrapers.\xc2\xa0 They are a testament to the transformation that is taking place here in Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 And on this journey we are thankful for the United States\xe2\x80\x99 hand in friendship.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Over the past two months, the strength of our relationship has been revealed for all to see.\xc2\xa0 From the day MH370 went missing, the United States lent its considerable expertise to the investigation and its unique capabilities and assets to the search effort.\xc2\xa0 We are grateful to you for standing by Malaysia in our hour of need.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The U.S. and Malaysia have a longstanding relationship.\xc2\xa0 We established diplomatic relations on the day of Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s independence in 1957.\xc2\xa0 In the decades that followed, when ideological tensions tore at Southeast Asia, the U.S. and Malaysia remained firm friends.\xc2\xa0 And over the past few years, we have been working to strengthen the bonds between us.\xc2\xa0 Today we see the fruits of this labor on the economy, on security and on people-to-people relations.\xc2\xa0 We are closer now than ever before.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Earlier this morning, the President and I talked at length about the issues we face in the region and in the world, and we took significant steps towards our shared objectives.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, we agreed to upgrade our bilateral relations to a Comprehensive Partnership.\xc2\xa0 This marks a new phase in our relationship with greater collaboration on the economy, security, education, science, technology, and more.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also decided to reinvigorate the Senior Officials Dialogue as a key forum for high-level discussion.\xc2\xa0 Together, these agreements lay a firm foundation for further cooperation to come.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Malaysia welcomes America\xe2\x80\x99s rebalancing towards Asia and its contribution to peace, stability and prosperity in the region.\xc2\xa0 Our continents share an ocean.\xc2\xa0 We should be connected by common policy, too.\xc2\xa0 We believe all parties should share in Asia\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable growth story, provided they also share a commitment to the peace upon which it depends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On global security, the President and I agreed to strengthen cooperation in peacekeeping training.\xc2\xa0 Malaysia has also decided to endorse the \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of Interdiction Principles\xe2\x80\x9d of the Proliferation Security Initiative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I expressed my appreciation to the President on U.S. strong support for ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, and for the confidence they have expressed in Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s chairmanship of ASEAN next year.\xc2\xa0 As we prepare for this chairmanship, and as we bid for a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, we seek a greater role in promoting global peace and regional stability.\xc2\xa0 In these endeavors and more, our friendship with the United States is immensely valued.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just last month, Malaysia helped secure a comprehensive agreement in the Southern Philippines, ending a conflict which claimed 150,000 lives, and denying al Qaeda and its affiliates a possible foothold in that region.\xc2\xa0 We have rejected religious extremism by establishing a Global Movement of Moderates.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the South China Sea, President Obama and I both stressed earlier the importance of upholding universally recognized principles of international law, including United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\xc2\xa0 We agreed that the full implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties was vital and that an effective Code of Conduct would enhance mutual trust.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President and I have agreed on a U.S.-Malaysia English Teaching Assistant Program, formerly known as the Fulbright Program.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to note that we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed on the bilateral work agreement for partners of diplomats and I would like to thank President Obama for agreeing to consider Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad the U.S. is now committed to provide technical briefings, security requirements, and information-sharing agreements for this purpose.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For centuries, our people have done business across the Pacific.\xc2\xa0 Today, we continue to do brisk trade.\xc2\xa0 Our bilateral trade has averaged at least 35 billion U.S. dollars annually from 2010 to 2013, while last year, the United States was Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s largest source of foreign investment, investing $1.9 billion in Malaysia and creating almost 8,000 jobs.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0President Obama and I welcome the progress made on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Trade deals are always complex, but our countries are committed to resolving the remaining issues.\xc2\xa0 I know all sides share our desire for an agreement that delivers the best for our citizens and our businesses.\xc2\xa0 I would like to thank President Obama for his understanding of Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s challenges and sensitivities in the TPP negotiations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Malaysia has always been a bridge between peoples and cultures, a trading nation bound by vital seas.\xc2\xa0 We are a modern progressive Muslim majority nation, a multiethnic, multi-religious society.\xc2\xa0 We have long known the benefit of cooperation across borders, and we have long recognized the power of shared prosperity.\xc2\xa0 In this context, it gives us sincere pleasure to welcome the U.S. delegation for this historic visit.\xc2\xa0 Your presence here, Mr. President, will mark the beginning of the next phase of our partnership, with deeper friendship and a more comprehensive partnership.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Over the past few days, we have found common cause on issues that matter -- those that would deliver opportunity for our people and security for our region.\xc2\xa0 And we have set the stage for a new phase of our relationship, one based on greater cooperation needed to equal the challenges of our time.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Selamat tengah hari.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Prime Minister Najib, for your warm welcome.\xc2\xa0 I am very pleased to be the first U.S. President to visit Malaysia in almost 50 years.\xc2\xa0 And it is wonderful to be staying in Kuala Lumpur -- one of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s most dynamic cities.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to thank Their Majesties, the King and the Queen, for their incredible hospitality at last night\xe2\x80\x99s state dinner, and the wonderful display of Malaysian culture in all its beauty and diversity.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank the people of Malaysia for such a warm welcome.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today the United States is once again playing a leadership role in the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And a key part of our strategy is expanding our ties with Southeast Asia -- and that includes Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 By virtue of geography, Malaysia is central to regional stability, maritime security and freedom of navigation. By virtue of its economic progress -- that\xe2\x80\x99s evident for all who visit here for the first time -- and by virtue of Prime Minister Najib\xe2\x80\x99s goal of making the economy even more competitive, Malaysia has the potential to unleash a new era of growth.\xc2\xa0 And by virtue of its diversity -- people from so many ethnic groups and backgrounds, holding different political beliefs and practicing different faiths, Malaysia has the opportunity to draw on the enormous strengths of its people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In the United States embracing that diversity and upholding the rights and dignity of all our citizens has always made us stronger, and I believe it can make Malaysia even stronger as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I welcomed Prime Minister Najib to Washington four years ago, and we agreed at that time to broaden and deepen the relationship between our countries.\xc2\xa0 Today, across a whole range of areas -- security, trade, regional institutions -- we\xe2\x80\x99re working more closely together than ever before.\xc2\xa0 And today, I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re formalizing our efforts in a new Comprehensive Partnership. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d note that we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen our cooperation during the response to the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.\xc2\xa0 And I want to again express the deepest condolences of the American people to all the families who lost loved ones on that flight -- Malaysian, American, Chinese and people from many other nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As we have since the beginning of this tragedy, we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with our Malaysian partners and we will continue to provide all the assistance we can in their search and the investigation.\xc2\xa0 And today, the Prime Minister and I discussed some of the lessons that are being learned from this tragedy and how nations, including our own, might continue to improve our cooperation moving forward. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Comprehensive Partnership we\xe2\x80\x99re launching today aims to deepen our economic ties.\xc2\xa0 As the Prime Minister noted, Malaysia and the United States are already close economic partners, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working together on the Trans-Pacific Partnership to open up Asia Pacific markets, boost exports, promote innovation and growth in both our nations.\xc2\xa0 The TPP will support good jobs in the United States and Malaysia, and it will help Malaysia meet its goal to become a high-income economy by the end of the decade.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today, the Prime Minister and I discussed the particular issues of importance to Malaysia and we agreed to work quickly to resolve those issues, consistent with a final high-standards, comprehensive TPP agreement.\xc2\xa0 And tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to join some of our business leaders as they sign three commercial agreements worth more than $1 billion of new trade and investment between our nations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Our Comprehensive Partnership will expand our security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 As a founding member of ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, Malaysia has already been a critical leader in building the institutions that can advance regional prosperity and security.\xc2\xa0 Strengthening ASEAN unity and its central role in the region is a key part of our own American engagement in Asia.\xc2\xa0 We very much agree with ASEAN\xe2\x80\x99s view and Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s view that disputes need to be resolved peacefully, without intimidation or coercion, and that all nations must abide by international rules and international norms.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We welcome Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s recent endorsement of the principles of the Proliferation Security Initiative, the global effort to prevent the <strike>tracking</strike> [trafficking] of weapons of mass destruction. We\xe2\x80\x99re aiming to step up our coordination on a range of challenges, from disaster relief to maritime security.\xc2\xa0 And we are looking forward to working closely with Malaysia on all these issues when it chairs both ASEAN and the EAS next year. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And finally, our Comprehensive Partnership will continue to strengthen the strong ties between our peoples, especially our young people.\xc2\xa0 The young women and men of Malaysia are brimming with potential, and we want to do more together to open the door of opportunity to everybody, regardless of race, religion, gender or language.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Prime Minister and I will be meeting with entrepreneurs from Malaysia, and why I\xe2\x80\x99ll be engaging with promising young leaders from across South[east] Asia later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And thanks to the tremendous success of our program to bring young Americans to Malaysia to teach English, the Prime Minister and I agreed to renew that program for several more years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The time that I spent in this region as a child helped to shape my understanding of the world, broadened my vision, left me with a lifelong affection for the people and traditions of Southeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 And I look forward to a new generation of Americans getting that same experience here in Malaysia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, Prime Minister Najib, thank you again for your partnership, for your vision for what our nations can accomplish together, not only for our two peoples, but for the peace and prosperity of this entire region.\xc2\xa0 Terima kasih banyak.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, and selamat datang to Mr. President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question on the issue of Proliferation Security Initiative.\xc2\xa0 This PSI, this is something new for Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to be the 103rd member of PSI?\xc2\xa0 And what is the SOP like?\xc2\xa0 And do we have the expertise?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And for Mr. President, is the U.S. going to assist us in capacity-building and other requirements?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 Well, this PSI is actually not new in substance because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working very closely with the United States and whenever there is a request for us to do some interdiction we\xe2\x80\x99ve never failed to respond.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today is to formalize it so that there will be a formal relationship.\xc2\xa0 And that relationship will just continue what we have done, and it also reflects a strong will and desire on Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s side to cooperate not only with the United States, with the international community, to stop the profilation -- proliferation -- sorry -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard one.\xc2\xa0 I always screw it up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 -- for the spread -- (laughter) -- of parts for nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get it right, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the Prime Minister said, this is an area where we\xe2\x80\x99ve already developed strong partnership.\xc2\xa0 And I want to commend Prime Minister Najib and his national security team and law enforcement, intelligence teams.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that when both of us came into office this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the top of the priority list.\xc2\xa0 And what we were seeing, though, was that this region was a potential area where traffickers in parts and systems that could lead to nuclear proliferation or weapons of mass destruction could operate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And so, in our conversations, in our teams\xe2\x80\x99 consultations, we began to tighten the links and bonds between us in terms of sharing information, identifying threats, and working more closely and cooperatively together.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What the PSI does, as the Prime Minister says, is formalize it.\xc2\xa0 It puts a framework around it.\xc2\xa0 It involves capacity-building, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a one-way street.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have been working on these issues for a long time.\xc2\xa0 I consider the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of the greatest threats to U.S. security, as well as international peace.\xc2\xa0 So we have developed a lot of capacities in this area.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is a partnership, and what we seek to do is to find ways in which the strengths and the information that each side has can be enhanced and combined and pooled so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the possibility of loose nuclear materials or certain component parts that are being shipped falling into the wrong hands.\xc2\xa0 And we very much appreciate the cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s already there, but I think what the PSI signifies is that we can do even better in the future.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\xc2\xa0 And, Mr. Prime Minister, selamat tengah hari.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 Good job there, Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, on the situation in Ukraine and the Russian sanctions that I know the United States and others may be announcing on Monday -- I guess my question is why wait on sectoral sanctions, as far as the United States is concerned?\xc2\xa0 Why not do that on your own, now and sooner, rather than wait for the Europeans to get on board on this?\xc2\xa0 Because aren\xe2\x80\x99t you concerned that Putin is essentially using the European angst over tougher sanctions as a way to slow-walk things and buy more time and space for himself?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Quickly, on a second topic, Mr. President, there\xe2\x80\x99s a controversy surrounding some horrendous, racially-charged comments that an owner of the L.A. Clippers made.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you care to comment on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And to the Prime Minister, the TPP -- I know you talked about it -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been generating some protests here in your country, including another one today -- chief concern being some worries, some higher costs of medical supplies in particular.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you can comment on those protests and the concern that somehow you\xe2\x80\x99re being bullied into the TPP by the United States.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that way on that front?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Okay, first, on Ukraine, in consultation with our European partners we\xe2\x80\x99ve determined that because Russia has failed to follow through on its side of the accord that had been hammered out in Geneva, it was important for us to take further steps, sending a message to Russia that the kind of destabilizing activities that are taking place in the east and the south of Ukraine had to stop.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was a glimmer of hope after the Geneva accords that Ukraine would follow through on its commitments to enter into a dialogue around constitutional reforms, that it would do everything it needed to do to disarm irregular forces and militias, and it would offer amnesty to those who willingly laid down arms and pulled out of the buildings.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that.\xc2\xa0 Russia has not lifted a finger to help.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s strong evidence that they have been encouraging the kinds of activities that have been taking place in eastern and southern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so, collectively, us and the Europeans have said that so long as Russia continues down a path of provocation rather than trying to resolve this issue peacefully and deescalating, there are going to be consequences and those consequences will continue to grow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, the notion that for us to go forward with sectoral sanctions on our own without the Europeans would be the most effective deterrent to Mr. Putin I think is factually wrong.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified, rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And, in fact, you notice that oftentimes they\xe2\x80\x99re really interested in portraying this through this old Cold War prism, when, in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the issue is here.\xc2\xa0 The issue is respecting basic international norms of sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 The issue is can the Ukrainians make their own decisions about how they govern themselves and who they have international relations with.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our only interest in this whole process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to make sure that we are part of an international coalition sending that message and that Russia is isolated in its actions, rather than falling into the trap of interpreting this as the United States is trying to pull Ukraine out of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, circa 1950.\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s not what this is about.\xc2\xa0 And the Europeans have a larger stake in this than anyone.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, as I said I think at the last press conference, there are going to be differences even within Europe, in part because of the nature of the economic relationships that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work through those in a systematic way.\xc2\xa0 If, in fact, we need to move forward with sectoral sanctions, then it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important that we know exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to do and sustain over the long haul; our European partners know what they\xe2\x80\x99re willing and able to do as well.\xc2\xa0 And the more we are unified, the more effective it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we, for example, say we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to allow certain arms sales to Russia -- just to take an example -- but every European defense contractor backfills what we do, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not very effective.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more effective if everybody signs on and everybody is committed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why only have --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9conly,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnever,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwhen.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said this is our strategy.\xc2\xa0 And I want to emphasize every time I address this question there is a diplomatic path to resolving this issue.\xc2\xa0 The Geneva statement pointed towards how we could resolve this statement.\xc2\xa0 What it asks of the Russians is hardly onerous:\xc2\xa0 Make a public statement that those militias need to lay down their arms and exit those buildings; participate with international observers and monitors, rather than stand by while they\xe2\x80\x99re being bullied and, in some cases, detained by these thugs; negotiate with the Ukrainian government and engage in some confidence-building measures.\xc2\xa0 These aren\xe2\x80\x99t heavy lifts if the Russians are sincere in wanting to resolve this problem.\xc2\xa0 So far we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep on raising the consequences of Russia rejecting that path towards diplomacy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to the statements by the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers -- for our Malaysian audience, this is a sports team, basketball team in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The owner is reported to have said some incredibly offensive racist statements that were published.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have to interpret those statements for you; they kind of speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 When people -- when ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance you don\xe2\x80\x99t really have to do anything, you just let them talk.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what happened here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am confident that the NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver, a good man, will address this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the NBA is a league that is beloved by fans all across the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got an awful lot of African American players.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s steeped in African American culture.\xc2\xa0 And I suspect that the NBA is going to be deeply concerned in resolving this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will make just one larger comment about this.\xc2\xa0 The United States continues to wrestle with a legacy of race and slavery and segregation that\xe2\x80\x99s still there -- the vestiges of discrimination. We\xe2\x80\x99ve made enormous strides, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to see this percolate up every so often.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we just have to be clear and steady in denouncing it, teaching our children differently, but also remaining hopeful that part of why some statements like this stand out so much is because there had been -- there has been this shift in how we view ourselves.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And like Malaysia, we constantly have to be on guard against racial attitudes that divide us rather than embracing our diversity as a strength.\xc2\xa0 And I know that the people of Malaysia are committed to wrestling with those issues as well.\xc2\xa0 We have to make sure that we stay on top of it -- and we will.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Even though it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t directed at me, I am going to say one thing about TPP -- this notion somehow that some protests here might indicate U.S. bullying.\xc2\xa0 Keep in mind, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got protests back home from my own party about TPP.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s never been a trade deal in which somebody is not going to at some point object because they\xe2\x80\x99re fearful of the future or they\xe2\x80\x99re invested in the status quo.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just very important for everybody to wait and see what exactly is the agreement that has been negotiated before folks jump to conclusions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you take an issue like drugs, for example, the United States does extraordinary work in research and development, and providing medical breakthroughs that save a lot of lives around the world.\xc2\xa0 Those companies that make those investments in that research oftentimes want a return, and so there are all kinds of issues around intellectual property and patents, and so forth.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think we would all agree that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a medicine that can save a lot of lives, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find a way to make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s available to folks who simply can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it as part of our common humanity.\xc2\xa0 And both those values are reflected in the conversations and negotiations that are taking place around TPP.\xc2\xa0 So the assumption somehow that right off the bat that\xe2\x80\x99s not something we\xe2\x80\x99re paying attention to, that reflects lack of knowledge of what is going on in the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But my point is you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if there are going to be objections, protests, rumors, conspiracy theories, political aggravation around a trade deal.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been around long enough, Chuck -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true in Malaysia; it\xe2\x80\x99s true in Tokyo; it\xe2\x80\x99s true in Seoul; it\xe2\x80\x99s true in the United States of America -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s true in the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I continue to strongly believe, however, that this is going to be the right thing to do -- creating jobs, creating businesses, expanding opportunity for the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be good for countries like Malaysia that have been growing rapidly but are interested in making that next leap to the higher-value aspects of the supply chain that can really boost income growth and development.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to echo what President Obama said.\xc2\xa0 Emphatically, in no uncertain terms, we went to the TPP on our own accord.\xc2\xa0 We were not bullied into it.\xc2\xa0 And I can attest to our commitment towards free trade as the principle and philosophy, because we have entered into 13 separate FTA agreements with other countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Malaysia is a great believer in free trade.\xc2\xa0 But we also understand that the benefits of free trade like boosting trade, creating wealth, jobs -- those are the good things.\xc2\xa0 But there will be some losers in the process -- there will be winners and losers.\xc2\xa0 But overall, the benefit, I think -- it\'s important for us to show to the people in Malaysia that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages of a free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is what, in a final analysis, what we have to do, because the underpinnings of a free trade agreement would be acceptance by the people.\xc2\xa0 And we are committed to that process. We\xe2\x80\x99ll engage with the public and we\xe2\x80\x99ll also present it to parliament.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are working out around the sensitivities and challenges, which I alluded to in my discussions with President Obama.\xc2\xa0 He fully understands our domestic sensitivities, and we will sit down and try to iron this out with the intention of trying to work out a deal in the near future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, selamat datang.\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, how do you see Malaysia efforts and ability in getting multinational support and efforts for the missing MH370 search-and-rescue operation?\xc2\xa0 And, Mr. President, I\'d appreciate if you can elaborate on the visa waiver request.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know personally, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in consultation with my team and all the assets that we have available, that the Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 And I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for all the countries in the region, but I can say that the United States and other partners have found the Malaysian government eager for assistance, have been fully forthcoming with us in terms of the information that they have.\xc2\xa0 And this is a joint effort.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details of what happened, but we do know that if, in fact, the plane went down in the ocean in this part of the world, that is a big, big place and it is a very challenging effort and laborious effort that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take quite some time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I completely understand the heartache that the families are going through and wanting answers.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important -- and I said to Prime Minister Najib -- that there should be full transparency in terms of what we know, what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, how the process is proceeding.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the United States is absolutely committed to providing whatever resources and assets that we can and that the Malaysian government has been very welcoming of that assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Visa Waiver Program, the way it works in the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very clear set of laws and provisions in terms of how someone -- how a country qualifies to be part of the Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 And the Prime Minister raised this issue with me, and my team is prepared to work with the Malaysian government to go through the various steps.\xc2\xa0 Typically, it takes some time, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that happens overnight, because we have to make sure that the kinds of information-sharing, the reporting about lost and stolen passports, terrorist watch lists -- that all those pieces are in place before it\xe2\x80\x99s facilitated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the growing and expanding trade that exists and the people-to-people relations between Malaysia and the United States, I want to make sure that we can start down a path.\xc2\xa0 It may take a little bit of time, but we welcome the opportunity to engage with the government on this issue.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Najib, good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your hospitality, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. President, you said at your press conference in Seoul you expressed some frustration with the narrative that military force is the best response to difficult foreign policy challenges.\xc2\xa0 I invite you to expand on that if you want to.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m more curious about what you said right after that -- there are many tools in the American toolbox to advance foreign policy interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As you know, one of those tools is for America to use her prestige to speak out on behalf of human rights, racial tolerance, political accountability and free speech.\xc2\xa0 As you well know, Mr. President, those issues are up for grabs in Malaysia right now, and they\xe2\x80\x99re probably best symbolized by the precarious legal position of Anwar Ibrahim, the opposition political leader in this country.\xc2\xa0 Former Vice President Al Gore has taken up his cause, as has Human Rights Watch and other international lawyers interested in human rights.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain, sir, why you have said nothing about these issues here in Malaysia, why you will not meet with Mr. Ibrahim, and how it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the United States government to advance these interests of political reform when it won\xe2\x80\x99t use the non-military tools in the toolbox you described in Seoul?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And, Mr. Prime Minister, have you made any commitments to the United States government about your efforts in the future to address the issue of political reform here in Malaysia?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, Major, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that there is not a meeting I have around the world where issues of freedom of the press, human rights, civil liberties aren\xe2\x80\x99t prominent on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that includes my meeting with Prime Minister Najib.\xc2\xa0 And I think when you say that issues are all \xe2\x80\x9cup for grabs\xe2\x80\x9d in Malaysia, I think that implies a judgment about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here in Malaysia that may not fully reflect the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made by Prime Minister Najib, but also the recognition I think by the Malaysian government that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The fact that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met with Mr. Anwar in and of itself is not indicative of our lack of concern, given the fact that there are a lot of people I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet with and opposition leaders that I don\xe2\x80\x99t meet with and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I\xe2\x80\x99m not concerned about them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But what I have shared with the Prime Minister is the core belief that societies that respect rule of law, that respect freedom of speech, that respect the right of opposition to oppose even when it drives you crazy, even when it\xe2\x80\x99s inconvenient, the\xc2\xa0 respect for freedom of assembly, the respect for people of different races and different faiths and different political philosophies -- that those values are at the core of who the U.S. is, but also I think are a pretty good gauge of whether a society is going to be successful in the 21st century or not.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I think the Prime Minister is the first to acknowledge that Malaysia has still got some work to do -- just like the United States, by the way, has some work to do on these issues.\xc2\xa0 Human Rights Watch probably has a list of things they think we should be doing as a government.\xc2\xa0 And I am going to be constantly committed to making sure that these issues get raised in a constructive way.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Najib came in as a reformer and one who is committed to it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to continue to encourage him as a friend and a partner to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress on that front.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRIME MINISTER NAJIB:\xc2\xa0 President Obama and I are both equally concerned about civil liberties as a principle.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, when I came into office in 2009, I introduced a slew of reforms, which include a very major undertaking on our part, which is to abolish the detention without trial, ISA.\xc2\xa0 Now, other countries have not done so, but Malaysia has taken the lead in doing so.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also introduced the Peaceful Assembly Act -- the right to protest, the right to assemble.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And within this spirit, it would be fair to say that this is the largest or the biggest reform in terms of civil liberties in Malaysia\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 So in that, I think you should not underestimate or diminish whatever we have done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Specifically on Anwar\xe2\x80\x99s case, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I want to put it on record, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the government against him.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an action taken by an individual who happens to be his former employee who\xe2\x80\x99s taken up this case against him -- a complainant.\xc2\xa0 And under the eyes of the law, even if you\xe2\x80\x99re a small man or a big man, you have equal justice.\xc2\xa0 I think you believe in that principle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So now the matter is before the courts.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not right for me to comment anything more than that.\xc2\xa0 But be assured that Malaysia is committed to the rule of law, to the independence of a judiciary and to civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to be done.\xc2\xa0 But it also means society has got to be prepared for it, for change, because what is important is the end result.\xc2\xa0 And the end result, as the Prime Minister, of this country, I\xe2\x80\x99m committed to ensure peace, stability and harmony.\xc2\xa0 That is the most important thing.\xc2\xa0 And people must respect that, because there are sensitivities on either side, sensitivities relating to minorities and majority as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we have to manage that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Malaysia has done.\xc2\xa0 And because of that, we are a relatively peaceful, harmonious nation.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0PRESIDENT OBAMA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Terima Kasih.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
