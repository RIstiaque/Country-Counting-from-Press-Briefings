EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I have brought with us today -- typically I begin these gaggles by talking about what the President is planning to do and what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to plan to see when we land. \xc2\xa0But in lieu of me making those comments, I thought I would bring two proud citizens of New Orleans who poured their heart and soul into the recovery of this great American city. \xc2\xa0So Donna Brazile and Walter Isaacson both served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority and played an instrumental role, even in some of the darkest days of that city\xe2\x80\x99s recovery, and showed a lot of the kind of perseverance that was critical to the success that this community is enjoying now.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give you a chance to hear from both of them directly and ask any questions you wanted to ask on this important occasion, and then we can get on to other business after that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0Josh, can we tell that joke about Natalie?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Please do. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0And working with us was Natalie, who ended up marrying Josh, and she was in charge of the Louisiana Recovery. \xc2\xa0She kept Donna and me straight. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet Donna come on in. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s the more interesting of the two. \xc2\xa0Go on in. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0Well, as you all know, New Orleans is my hometown. \xc2\xa0I was born at Charity Hospital, and I had the great honor yesterday to be at the reopening of University Medical Center. \xc2\xa0University Medical Center will be a Trauma One facility -- the only one in the state of Louisiana. \xc2\xa0And it was just a great experience to be there with former Governor Blanco. \xc2\xa0This started under her leadership. \xc2\xa0Governor Jindal finished it. \xc2\xa0It started under the leadership of Ray Nagin, and now Mayor Mitch Landrieu is finishing it. \xc2\xa0And it started under President Bush, and now President Obama has finished the task of our rebuilding with our health care.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s a proud moment to go back. \xc2\xa0As you all know, during the height of the storm, over 1,800 people perished, more than 100,000 homes destroyed, and millions of our fellow citizens displaced, scattered in 32 states across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tKatrina was more than just a natural disaster, it was in every way a personal tragedy. \xc2\xa0I mentioned 1,800 of our fellow citizens who perished during the storm. \xc2\xa0It has taken us more than I think 10 years to finish up some of the recovery. \xc2\xa0We still have a long way to do. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re proud of all of the work that has been done over the last 10 years in helping to rebuild the city, rebuild the region. \xc2\xa0The levees are stronger. \xc2\xa0We have a better evacuation plan than we had 10 years ago. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I want to also thank my colleague, Walter Isaacson. \xc2\xa0He was a member of the LRA, he was vice-chair. \xc2\xa0For almost three solid years, we went home practically every week to ensure that the recovery was on pace, to come back to Washington to lobby for resources, and to work with state and local officials. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think when you get down on the ground, what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear is of course the people talk about resiliency. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the mayor and the governor talk about the partnership with the federal government, working with the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0And what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the locals I think is gratitude -- gratitude of all who came to help us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0I want to talk about the promises Obama made, especially the four promises. \xc2\xa0But let me start by saying that Donna Brazile and I go way back. \xc2\xa0When I was like 21 years old, I worked at the Picayune covering Moon Landrieu, who had just become -- and she was an intern for Moon Landrieu and used to leak me large sums of information. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And I could have gotten her in trouble.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President made four promises when he came into office. \xc2\xa0One was that health care would get better, we\xe2\x80\x99d have a world-class health care system. \xc2\xa0Secondly, it would be a world-class education. \xc2\xa0Then the levees and economic development. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Donna has told you, this week New Orleans opened a $1.1 billion University Medical Center. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a first-class trauma center, but it also has 60 units for behavioral problems so that the psychological needs are being kept. \xc2\xa0The Veterans Administration is about to open another huge hospital there. \xc2\xa0But even more important, there are 60 neighborhood clinics. \xc2\xa0Mayor Landrieu, working with the federal government, has been able to decentralize the provision of health care into these neighborhood clinics, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a model for what we should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the school system -- the school system, instead of being rebuilt, it was reinvented. \xc2\xa0And what New Orleans did was try -- people talk about it as a system of charter schools; that\xe2\x80\x99s misleading. \xc2\xa0What it is is a system of autonomous schools, where school leaders have a lot of power to be able to do any reforms they want, any way of doing it, but it has to come with high standards so there\xe2\x80\x99s assessment in standards. \xc2\xa0And most importantly, the parents and kids have to have choice. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s now one application process. \xc2\xa0Almost 70 percent of the kids get into one of the top four of their choices. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an open enrollment; you can apply to any school.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were problems with that when we first started. \xc2\xa0One is that schools would skim the cream. \xc2\xa0So we worked -- and that was a problem. \xc2\xa0Even more so, there was a problem that they would avoid special needs kids. \xc2\xa0So that had to be fixed. \xc2\xa0And a couple years ago, the special needs problem was done by an allocation of a lot more money and an allocation of special needs kids where the schools -- that was taken away from them, the ability to deal with how they were going to select special needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother problem was expulsions; schools would expel too many people. \xc2\xa0So we had to remove that authority -- even though it was an autonomous school -- from the local schools, so that if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be expelled it had to be done by a central group. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s cut expulsions by like 80 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe number of graduation has gone up. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a Tulane report -- I should get the numbers exactly right. \xc2\xa0But graduation rates and school score rates have gone up phenomenally. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll give out the numbers later. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s all in the -- from 55 percent to 74 percent. \xc2\xa0The number of failing schools has dropped from 35 percent to 9 percent. \xc2\xa0And generally, if you talk to the kids, their ability to choose a school has become really important to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the levies, I won\xe2\x80\x99t go into in depth, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a world-class levee system.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as for the economy, there\xe2\x80\x99s still some problems in the economy. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s still 39 percent of the kids in New Orleans are in poverty, which is about the same as before the storm. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s been five times the number of increase in jobs in New Orleans as the rest of the nation, as a percentage. \xc2\xa0And the startups have 64 percent higher than the rest of the nation rate.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem for New Orleans is pretty much a middle-class problem because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of corporations that moved headquarters back. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of big firms. \xc2\xa0And manufacturing is starting to come back. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s twice as many restaurants as there was before the hurricane. \xc2\xa0These are jobs, but not the highest-paying jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think our challenge in the coming years is to reduce the poverty rate and to figure out how to bring middle-class jobs in the city. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to just sugarcoat everything that\xe2\x80\x99s been happening. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some problems there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Do you guys have any questions for Donna or Walter?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been quite a lot of discussion about income disparities and perhaps the school reforms exacerbating some of those incomes disparities.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think school reforms did at all. \xc2\xa0I mean, school reforms have given enormous opportunities where twice as many kids are now going to college.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But they gentrified some areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0The gentrification issue is one I was talking to Shaun Donovan about. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely intellectually complex to me, because if you look at Trem\xc3\xa9, Bywater, the Marigny, a lot of hipsters are moving in, and there are a lot of creative types. \xc2\xa0And I was in the St. Roch market a couple of days ago and everybody seems to have purple hair and earrings. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s very -- so it\xe2\x80\x99s a changing mix. \xc2\xa0And if you talk to people in the neighborhood, I would say many people are like, wow, people are sitting on their porches at midnight with laptops. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even walk down the street at midday five years ago. \xc2\xa0On the other hand, others are saying, hey, I can hardly afford to live in my old neighborhood.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, oddly, gentrification -- if you had asked me 10 years ago what will be the biggest problem you\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked on an airplane about New Orleans, and people would say gentrification of Trem\xc3\xa9, Bywater, and the Marigny -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say you\xe2\x80\x99re out of your mind, they\xe2\x80\x99ll never come back. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to minimize that. \xc2\xa0I think the whole country -- creative urban areas where young and hip and startup and entrepreneurial types are moving in. \xc2\xa0New Orleans needs for its own soul, but also for what it is, to keep diversity, to keep a real mix of people. \xc2\xa0Otherwise you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the food, the music, the creativity. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we need to do a lot more. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of Section 8, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of housing vouchers, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things being done. \xc2\xa0But we need to do a lot more to make sure that the diversity -- socioeconomic, racially and ethnically -- remain something that for 298 years has defined New Orleans and made it creative -- that we don\xe2\x80\x99t lose that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I mean, if you -- as I said, I was down at St. Roch a couple days ago and down in Marigny -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to feel it\xe2\x80\x99s lost yet, but you will see a lot more hipsters wandering around than before.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0Rebuilding was very expensive. \xc2\xa0And for those who own homes, it was the opportunity to rebuild stronger, rebuild safer. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget during our conversations back in 2005, 2006, and we tried to figure out how to fortify the city, how to strengthen the levee and the flood system, how to ensure that neighborhoods that were basically decimated in the aftermath of Katrina and Hurricane Rita -- let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina, Rita hit us and re-flooded the city. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for many who were renters, the ability to come back to homes that they did not own, relying on others to rebuild a house, the rent values went up, the property values went up. \xc2\xa0And on the one hand, it has helped to anchor many of our 72 neighborhoods. \xc2\xa0And there are some neighborhoods that are still struggling to come back safer and stronger, with more opportunity, more jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a cousin in the Gentilly neighborhood, and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a neighbor in 10 years. \xc2\xa0Although the blight situation has gotten much better under Mayor Landrieu, the debris has been removed in I would say about 80, 90 percent of the neighborhoods, but in some neighborhoods there\xe2\x80\x99s still a struggle to get back, to find jobs and to create new opportunity for those who would like to come back home one day.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0The Washington Post -- Roig had really good story on gentrification about four or five days ago, and the whole mixed thing of walking through Trem\xc3\xa9 and listening to people. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d really recommend you do it, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not spinning an answer here. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just a fascinating and complex issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would love people to look -- if you really care about the education thing, the Cowen Institute at Tulane -- I have it here -- just put out Katrina 10. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a big Tulane study, and it gives you the whole complexities -- upside skimming, special needs kids, expulsion issues. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a biased report; I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Tulane University report. \xc2\xa0And you can get it online. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s awesomely good, it has all the facts up and down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President talks in his remarks that we got excerpts from about structural inequalities that were revealed from Katrina that fell along racial and poverty lines. \xc2\xa0Do you think that those have improved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I think so. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten -- in many ways, we began to address these issues. \xc2\xa0Katrina exposed more than just the waterline in Louisiana and New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. \xc2\xa0It also exposed extreme pockets of poverty.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 9th Ward is a very special area because during the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s and \xe2\x80\x9850s, the African Americans -- homeownership in that area improved by almost 100 percent, and yet that was one of the places where we had severe flooding. \xc2\xa0New Orleans East, for example, another part of the city where African American homeownership grew by leaps and bounds in the late \xe2\x80\x9840s and \xe2\x80\x9850s and \xe2\x80\x9860s as the black middle class began to take root inside that portion of city.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut structurally it\xe2\x80\x99s been -- the type of rebuilding efforts and the new what I call -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived the experience -- so the new requirements for insurance in order to insure your house requires you to build safer, stronger. \xc2\xa0In some places like New Orleans East, many of the residents had to build their houses higher, off the ground, so to speak. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, structural problems still exist. \xc2\xa0Poverty still exists. \xc2\xa0There are still huge pockets of poverty. \xc2\xa0But things have gotten extremely better. \xc2\xa0I think part of it is the education system. \xc2\xa0And I believe over the next 10 years, as we begin to continue to rebuild more of the homes, improve the opportunities for people to come home and find affordable housing, that old mixture of gumbo where all the roux and the sausage and the ochre comes together to make this delicious, creamy, delightful dish will return to the Big Easy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0That\'s an important point, which is the ethnic diversity of New Orleans is what has made it strong, and we got to make sure that remains strong. \xc2\xa0And in some ways, Mitch Landrieu and the President and everybody else, their policies, have tried so hard to assure that. \xc2\xa0And I think it has -- so you do see that, that it\xe2\x80\x99s still a very vibrant mix, a little bit more Hispanic and Vietnamese, but everybody adds to the gumbo, as Donna says.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- that the recovery is ongoing, it\xe2\x80\x99s not done yet. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s the finish line? \xc2\xa0Is it ever done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0New Orleans wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to just recover. \xc2\xa0As Mitch Landrieu said, we\'re trying to build the city we should have had. \xc2\xa0And I think, of course, that\'s an ongoing process. \xc2\xa0We turn 300 in 2018, so I think we have another 300 years of doing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I will say that the rebuilding -- I mean, we can take a breath and say -- when Donna and I were in the helicopter coming in right after the levees broke, and we were part of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, I thought the city wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. \xc2\xa0I thought it just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there. \xc2\xa0I mean, it just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. \xc2\xa0My house was under eight feet of water. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to be done. \xc2\xa0Poverty is still at a high level. \xc2\xa0But the unemployment is lower than what it was before. \xc2\xa0The school system is better than it was before. \xc2\xa0The health care system -- as President Obama promised -- is much better than it was before. \xc2\xa0The levees are better than it was before. \xc2\xa0So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking a victory lap, but we should be looking ahead, not back.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I agree with Walter. \xc2\xa0And again, I speak from personal experience. \xc2\xa0My dad was under -- close to 15 feet of water in Mid-City, not far from where Walter\xe2\x80\x99s family in Broadmoor. \xc2\xa0It took several days for my father to get rescued. \xc2\xa0I can -- I go back now and look at the area -- Mid-City is coming back. \xc2\xa0Not all of the people are home. \xc2\xa0Some decided to stay away because they didn\'t want to come back. \xc2\xa0Some have come back, they\'re rebuilding, they\'re rebuilding stronger. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to take us another five or 10 years to ensure that all of the homes are rebuilt. \xc2\xa0The blight is gone and I think the jobs will come back. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a very diverse economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI like the hipsters.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I\'m one of them. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m like Walter -- I tend to stay out a little bit later at night, and I like to roam some of the neighborhoods. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s great to just go along Bywater and Marigny and Mid-City, and just see all of the new people who are there. \xc2\xa0I think many of them respecting the old culture, but it\'s really a different culture, a different vibration, but it\'s still the same old American city that I think all of us love. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- about the Lower 9th Ward. \xc2\xa0The community center where the President is going to deliver his remarks this afternoon is there and it\'s recently reopened. \xc2\xa0And I\'m just wondering a little bit about the recovery in that neighborhood because it was one of the hardest hit after Katrina.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0People think that Katrina is the Katrina -- the storm that flooded the 9th Ward. \xc2\xa0It was actually the aftermath. \xc2\xa0The levees, the levees broke. \xc2\xa0New Orleans is a city of levees and 17 canals, and when the pumps, the generators didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back on and that levee wall broke, the Lower 9th really went under.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was there within 10 days of the Lower 9th. \xc2\xa0I never thought the Lower 9th would be rebuilt. \xc2\xa0And I remember when the first group of homeowners came back and began to figure out that they could rebuild. \xc2\xa0That was one area, Walter, that we had a lot of conversation, a lot of Army Corps of Engineers, as well as scientists to tell us how to build that stronger.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you all know, CVS is now there anchored in that community. \xc2\xa0More shops are coming back, more people are coming back. \xc2\xa0And the adjoining parish, St. Bernard Parish, Arabi and others, they\xe2\x80\x99re coming back.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re going to an area that has been slow, very slow, in large part because of I think the safety. \xc2\xa0The levee had to be reconstructed. \xc2\xa0That levee collapsed. \xc2\xa0And once that levee was rebuilt -- and I believe it was rebuilt stronger. \xc2\xa0Many of us went out there to see the construction of that process, crossing over the Industrial Canal -- I think the people started to come home, feeling much safer, knowing that they could rebuild higher -- meaning that they had to lift up their property or rebuild at a higher level. \xc2\xa0And now the jobs are coming back there. \xc2\xa0The community -- it\'s been very slow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s one of the neighborhoods that I think we\'re focused on, that the city and the Mayor will continue to put a lot of resources in and find new partnerships to rebuild the Lower 9th, New Orleans East, as well as some of the surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0I think it\'s very important that the President is going to the Sanchez Center, because it took a long time for the Lower 9 to come back. \xc2\xa0You can assess either blame or explanation. \xc2\xa0It was harder to rebuild the levee there. \xc2\xa0It is obviously the lowest part of the city. \xc2\xa0That\'s why it\'s called Lower 9 -- it\'s down river, meaning lower down river. \xc2\xa0And when we on the Louisiana Recovery Authority -- Donna used to sit next to me to make sure we stayed in line, but we voted saying you had to build a few feet above base flood elevation. \xc2\xa0That made it harder for people to rebuild in Lower 9 because they had to raise their houses more to be above the base flood elevation. \xc2\xa0On the other hand, do you want to send people down to a place where they\xe2\x80\x99re below the flood elevation?</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it was a complicated thing. \xc2\xa0So it took a while. \xc2\xa0But Mitch Landrieu and President Obama decided that they were going to really make sure that the recovery hadn\'t been declared successful until we really started rebuilding Lower 9. \xc2\xa0So this is a $21 million, huge, beautiful -- I\'ve seen it -- recreation center, along with shops and stores coming back. \xc2\xa0But you\'re going to visit the slowest part of the city to come back, but I think this was the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment and the Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s commitment that now we\'ve really got to get committed to Lower 9.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know Mitch has built a lot of -- a new fire station down there, everything else. \xc2\xa0So we can either get blamed for taking a while to get Lower 9 back. \xc2\xa0I could give you a lot of explanations, but I won\'t. \xc2\xa0But at least now, this center is the symbol that, all right, this neighborhood has to come back as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0President Bush obviously suffered seriously politically because of what was seen as a major failure of government and his administration. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President today is -- the message is about the resilience of the city, but it seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s also trying to send a message about the ways government can and should function when it\'s working and take some credit for that. \xc2\xa0Is that fair for him to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0Well, I\'m one of those individuals that believes that under President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s leadership we got it right. It was slow. \xc2\xa0Remember the same local government was overwhelmed and the federal government had to step in. \xc2\xa0The federal government had to figure out its role, and it took a while for the federal government to really figure out how to help us. \xc2\xa0And I think once the President made the decision that New Orleans would be rebuilt -- and despite some of the conversation on Capitol Hill that didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the federal government should invest hundreds and billions of dollars into the recovery effort -- the President made a commitment and I think he kept his word. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I just want to say something about the First Lady. \xc2\xa0First Lady Laura Bush made a commit to rebuild the libraries, and she has not only raised the money but she has been instrumental in helping to reopen libraries across the city. \xc2\xa0So the President is coming on Friday, and I think he will also receive a warm welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso President Clinton will be coming on Saturday, during the commemoration. \xc2\xa0He played a very important role in getting some of the private sector --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0As H.W.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0H.W. -- that\'s right -- the Bush Katrina fund that helped to raise money; also helped those who were stranded outside of the city as well. \xc2\xa0We have a lot of partners, a lot of nonprofits, a lot of corporations who have been part of this recovery effort. \xc2\xa0And I think everyone deserves an opportunity to come back to see how much work -- how much we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished and how much more work we need to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0President George W. Bush I think gets a bum rap. \xc2\xa0It took a while to get thing started, it was a little bit slow. \xc2\xa0But he cared about the city deeply, and so did Laura Bush. I remember being at a lunch -- with you. \xc2\xa0I was seated next to Laura Bush. \xc2\xa0And somebody said, we can\xe2\x80\x99t get Lower 9 rebuilt yet because the traffic lights aren\xe2\x80\x99t working, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have electricity. \xc2\xa0And everybody said, okay, and moved on. \xc2\xa0And she said -- she spoke up and she said, excuse me, wait a minute, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the electricity back on? \xc2\xa0Why not? \xc2\xa0And then her husband said, yes, why not? \xc2\xa0Turned to the acting FEMA Director. And she had a real passion. \xc2\xa0And Margaret Spellings helped us map out some of the ideas for the school system.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a political thing. \xc2\xa0I think once President George W. Bush got focused, he cared, too, and he helped, too. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I want to say this about President Obama. People forget that in 2005, he was still a state senator, and he went down to Texas to many of the shelters in other areas to help with some of the medical needs. \xc2\xa0And he made a commitment then that if he was in the Senate he would help us, and he did. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe partnered with Mary Landrieu and Trent Lott and Thad Cochran on a number of bills during our recovery efforts, including The Road Home. \xc2\xa0And I guess I can speak for a lot of my family who heard just recently that HUD is going to continue and forgive those who are still in the long process of rebuilding.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we have a lot to be thankful for and grateful, especially for the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership. \xc2\xa0And it didn\xe2\x80\x99t start when he got into the White House; it started back in 2005.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0And one quick shout-out to Shaun Donovan, who\xe2\x80\x99s up there. \xc2\xa0Just in the past few weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s helped eliminate some of the final barriers to people getting home, especially the Lower 9, because The Road Home program, which was the housing program, it was pretty complicated and for some families, it was a little bit more difficult. \xc2\xa0And Shaun Donovan has been down in New Orleans I think more than I have, and he has recently, yet again, solved a problem we had, which is cutting through the red tape on people who still owe money on The Road Home program and haven\xe2\x80\x99t been reimbursed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I think one last federal agency that deserves a lot of credit -- as you know, during the storm and after the storm, we had an acronym for FEMA -- that was Federal Employees Missing in Action -- but today it really is the Federal Emergency Management Association. \xc2\xa0It has a done a tremendous job in helping us put together a plan for the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, as you know, since Hurricane Rita -- I mean, Hurricane Katrina and Rita, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had Ike, Gustav, Isaac. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve had several more hurricanes. \xc2\xa0And the city is stronger, the region is stronger. \xc2\xa0And I can attest personally to the fact that FEMA is also stronger and more efficient.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing you back for every gaggle now. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0I\'ll be around. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Walter is giving out Tulane -- I have an LSU study. \xc2\xa0So I just want to let you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Tulane-LSU thing here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0These are the notes I had if anybody wants them. \xc2\xa0You all can share them. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you need them back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ISAACSON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t need them back. \xc2\xa0But if I got any stats wrong, correct me.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. BRAZILE: \xc2\xa0And I know we have a copy of Mitch Landrieu\xe2\x80\x99s 10th anniversary speech -- I\'ll send it to Josh if you all need that as well. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of material. \xc2\xa0And thank you all. \xc2\xa0We hope you enjoy the city, and maybe you can get some Po-Boy. \xc2\xa0And as we do in Louisiana, \xe2\x80\x9cgo make some groceries\xe2\x80\x9d before you come back. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Hi, guys. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of something the President often said during his campaign in 2007 and 2008. \xc2\xa0He said that people who love their country do have an opportunity to change it. \xc2\xa0And just listening to the two of them talk, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that people who love their city have an opportunity to save it. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly what Donna Brazile and Walter Isaacson did. \xc2\xa0And they obviously are appreciative of a lot of the help that they got, but there\xe2\x80\x99s so many people who were involved in this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the success that we are celebrating today would clearly not have been possible without Walter Isaacson and Donna Brazile and so many others who dedicated their lives to the city that they love. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty inspiring just listening to them talk. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s enough from me.</p>\n<p>\n\tI do have one other piece of news on a totally different topic before I get to your questions, and it\xe2\x80\x99s simply this. \xc2\xa0Some of you asked me yesterday about the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the King of Saudi Arabia, King Salman, visiting the White House. \xc2\xa0The President will host the King of Saudi Arabia, Salman, at the White House on Friday, September 4th -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a week from tomorrow. \xc2\xa0This will be the King\xe2\x80\x99s first visit to Washington since ascending the throne.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis visit underscores the importance of the strategic partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia. \xc2\xa0The President and the King will discuss a range of issues and focus on ways to further strengthen the bilateral relationship, including our joint security and counterterrorism efforts. \xc2\xa0They will also discuss regional topics, including the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and steps to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the region. \xc2\xa0So you can look forward to that next Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, if there are remaining questions, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take them. \xc2\xa0Anything else on your mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick question on Iran. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re reporting on an IAEA report today where the agency says Iran is pretty much adhering to the terms of the nuclear deal and taking steps to curtail its nuclear program. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you had seen either our report or the IAEA report and had any comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Darlene, I have not seen the specific report that you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is that the United States and the international community with whom we negotiated this agreement has insisted that before any sanctions relief is offered to Iran, they will need to take the steps that are outlined in the agreement, and we will need to have the IAEA verify their compliance with the agreement before sanctions relief is offered.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so there are a variety of steps that are required. \xc2\xa0These are things like reducing their uranium stockpile by 98 percent, disconnecting thousands of centrifuges, essentially gutting the core of the heavy-water reactor at Arak. \xc2\xa0So all those steps will be steps that we will verify before any sanctions relief is offered. \xc2\xa0And that is the lynchpin of the agreement. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be following this closely in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a separate matter, Josh, China has been passing some blame to the Fed and U.S. policies for turmoil in the markets, and saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not just because of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in China and the devaluation of the yuan. \xc2\xa0Do you have any comments or thoughts about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some interesting cocktail of things I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on which both are Fed actions and individual market movements. \xc2\xa0But let me try to help by saying this: \xc2\xa0I would note that the data that was released by the Department of Commerce today about the true growth of the U.S. economy in the second quarter -- as you know, it was revised up from just the initial 2.3 measurement to 3.7 -- that is an additional data point to indicate the ongoing strength and resilience of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the trends to the U.S. economy right now are reassuring even in the midst of some significant volatility in markets overseas. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat our priority continues to be is making sure that additional uncertainty is not unnecessarily injected into the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made sure that Congress understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s a priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s and the country\xe2\x80\x99s to make sure that Congress passes a budget on time that properly and fully funds our economic and national security imperatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while we continue to be very focused on the Iran deal, this is another priority that will require Congress\xe2\x80\x99s urgent attention and action in September. \xc2\xa0And that is surely the best way for Congress to support the American economic resilience that is so critical when we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing such instability in other markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything more about the Fed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t, I don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0But thank you for giving me the opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I can follow up on the Chinese markets. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve reported today that China has resumed propping up, supporting its markets, and one way of doing that is by selling U.S. treasuries. \xc2\xa0And of course, it holds a lot of U.S. treasuries. \xc2\xa0Do you have a reaction to that action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the Treasury Department about that. \xc2\xa0I have not seen those initial reports. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have constantly urged, even pressured, the Chinese leadership to do is to take steps and to advance their ongoing efforts to have a market-determined currency rate. \xc2\xa0And this has obviously been a priority of the United States. \xc2\xa0This is something that Secretary Lew has been very focused on, particularly in the context of his discussions with his Chinese counterparts. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this will be the subject of discussions when the President next has the opportunity to visit with his counterpart.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you waded in yet about whether you\xe2\x80\x99re okay with the CR as opposed to, like, something more lasting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we have indicated, Tamara, is we believe that Congress, well before the deadline of the end of September, should pass a budget that fully and properly funds our economic and national security priorities. \xc2\xa0That means not passing a budget that continues or extends the mindless budget cuts that are associated with the sequester.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have suggested that Republicans in Congress should sit down with their Democratic counterparts, as they did two years ago, and broker the kind of bipartisan agreement that is clearly in the best interest of our economy. \xc2\xa0We urged them to do that much earlier this summer. \xc2\xa0Congress, as they frequently do -- or as leaders in Congress frequently do, have procrastinated, and we\xe2\x80\x99re now getting close to the deadline. \xc2\xa0And that is something that we are not pleased about.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that when Congress gets back to work after Labor Day, that Republicans will accept the invitation that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from Democrats in Congress to try to negotiate a bipartisan solution that reflects the economic and national security needs of the country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have not waded into sort of how exactly that should be done at this point, but we have merely said that the mindless cuts of the sequester should not be extended, and all of this should get done in bipartisan fashion well in advance of the deadline.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, there was some speculation the other day about a lunch conversation between Vice President Biden and the President. \xc2\xa0But last night, there was a call between the Vice President and the DNC about the Iran deal, and obviously some speculation about his presidential run where he said he\xe2\x80\x99s not sure if there is the emotional fuel at this time to run. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the Vice President and his family have been through a lot. \xc2\xa0Does the President have any thoughts on that, or you, the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Any thoughts that the President may have on this topic were shared directly with the Vice President at their lunch, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight on those conversations to share with you. \xc2\xa0Those are private conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I have said about this is I have acknowledged that the decision that anyone makes to run for President of the United States is an intensely personal one. \xc2\xa0And certainly this President understands that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to try to give the Vice President the time and space that he has earned to make this intensely personal decision. \xc2\xa0And that is, as he told the DNC members yesterday, exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for any conversations between the President and the Vice President, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to protect their privacy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that offer of time and space indefinite? \xc2\xa0Because there\xe2\x80\x99s some indication that he could let this decision linger on for even a few more months.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I have acknowledged that the Vice President has earned the right to make this decision on a timeframe of his own choosing. \xc2\xa0Now, I think the Vice President has also acknowledged some of the time limitations associated with that. \xc2\xa0It takes some time to build a viable and even successful national campaign. \xc2\xa0And the Vice President is somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s mounted two national campaigns himself, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been on the national ticket twice. \xc2\xa0So he understands that. \xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99ll make those decisions about what pressures he feels as it relates to timing based on his own experience and on his own analysis of the current situation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Financial Post of Canada reported today that -- you know where this is going -- that the Keystone decision -- a denial of the Keystone decision is coming within days. \xc2\xa0Is the Financial Post right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the Financial Post of Canada did not land on my doorstep this morning, so I haven\'t seen that specific report. \xc2\xa0Apparently, I should have looked at it; I did not have the opportunity to view it this morning. \xc2\xa0This project continues to be under review by the State Department. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any decision that the State Department has forwarded on to the White House. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that this review process is still ongoing, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on timing at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you go out and say that report is wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen the report, so I\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant to do that. \xc2\xa0But I would say that the review is still ongoing at the State Department, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of when that review might be completed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you characterize or describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s affinity or feelings towards New Orleans? \xc2\xa0I know some of the material the White House put out yesterday said he\xe2\x80\x99s been there nine times. \xc2\xa0But how does he feel toward this city?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as Donna mentioned, the President did have the opportunity to spend time with the citizens of New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of the storm. \xc2\xa0That included traveling to Houston, where many people of New Orleans who had to flee the city were received by their neighbors across the Texas border. \xc2\xa0The President said at the time -- and has noted since -- that he was very moved by those conversations. \xc2\xa0And it is clear to anybody who spent any time in New Orleans, either before the storm or after, how much the people of New Orleans love their city and how much they have embraced the unique status that they have in our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tNew Orleans is an interesting place -- it\xe2\x80\x99s like no other in the country or in the world. \xc2\xa0And it is a place where a lot of different kinds of people have come together to build a very colorful city. \xc2\xa0And they faced a very stiff challenge in the aftermath of Katrina. \xc2\xa0This is the worst disaster that any great American city has encountered. \xc2\xa0And that city came together despite their differences and despite the long odds, and despite the dark days to rebuild the community. \xc2\xa0And what was no small undertaking. \xc2\xa0And it required a generosity, and a generosity of spirit that I personally found to be genuinely inspiring. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWalter alluded to the fact that my wife actually traveled down, and worked shortly after the storm, under the Louisiana Recovery Authority. \xc2\xa0And she got to know Walter and Donna and many of the other people that the President will have the President to see today. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to know some of those people over the years, as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it really is inspiring -- all that they have gone through and all that they have accomplished. \xc2\xa0And I think the President, based on his own personal interactions and his own personal relationships -- he knows obviously both Donna and Walter very well. \xc2\xa0And I know that his personal reaction has been the same, and I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s really looking forward to this visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of you may have traveled to New Orleans with the President five years ago. \xc2\xa0The President traveled down here to mark the fifth anniversary and spend some time in the community. \xc2\xa0And even then, even just five years after the storm, it was evident that there was a real energy and a real vibrancy to the city. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made tremendous progress, even in just the last five years. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to visit New Orleans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to seeing firsthand the tremendous progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made so far.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that Mayor Landrieu has had a herculean task in leading that city, and he certainly deserves a ton of credit for the way that he has used his authority and his leadership to really bring that city together to establish his vision for this city living up to its potential. \xc2\xa0And I know that the people who have worked so hard to rebuild this city over the last 10 years are really looking forward to today and the rest of the weekend, and their pride is justified. \xc2\xa0And even though I am not citizen of New Orleans and I have not had a chance to live in this city, I share their pride today just because I have a little bit of insight into how much they have had to endure to enjoy this moment. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou guys are going to hear from the President a couple of different times today, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to speak based on this own interactions with the people of New Orleans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to hearing what the President has to say.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:16 P.M.
