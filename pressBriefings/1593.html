EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I have somewhere to hold onto while we do this -- as you can tell, we\'re getting closer to our destination.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what changed between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning that you all decided to make this trip?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Friday morning, in our senior staff meeting, we began -- one of the things we talked about was going down there.\xc2\xa0 When I was asked the question we were working on it but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have firm plans.\xc2\xa0 And the President just believed it was important to get down there as soon as we could, and the quickest we could get down was today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give you some brief updates to our schedule.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to land as scheduled at Louis Armstrong Airport in New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 The plane will be met by the Governor.\xc2\xa0 The Governor and the President will have an opportunity to spend some time together and talk.\xc2\xa0 Instead of heloing to Venice, Louisiana, we are going to drive because of -- as you can tell and feel descending here -- weather conditions.\xc2\xa0 It\'s probably about a two-hour drive.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\'re working on the schedule and how that affects our schedule and the degree to which the weather will impact our movements throughout the day.\xc2\xa0 There\'s a series of weather calls that they\'re going to have to make as we go along.\xc2\xa0 So bear with us and we will give you guys information as quickly we get it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s still possible he might be able to chopper back to Armstrong after the briefing?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s possible, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it just wind or is there some other --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was told there was a tornado watch in the area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Governor going to ride with the President down to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on logistics.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me also say this.\xc2\xa0 As you know, John Brennan, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism, is onboard and briefed the President on what we knew about New York on the helicopter ride to Andrews.\xc2\xa0 Brennan -- Mr. Brennan has talked obviously with Secretary Napolitano.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Napolitano had talked to Mayer Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 John Brennan has also spoken this morning with the FBI and NYPD.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For about 50 minutes at the beginning of the flight, from roughly 11:25 to 12:15 p.m. Eastern Time, the President was -- went through a series of briefings and updates on the situation in the Gulf with both John Brennan and Carol Browner -- Carol also obviously along on the trip, as well as Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel -- so to get the latest on where we are and the conditions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to meet with any BP executives when he is down there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone from the seafood industry?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s one of the stops that we\'re hoping to again -- the schedule because of weather calls is being changed a bit because of helo rides.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would you characterize from the briefing he had the situation as worsening?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, you\'ll get a firsthand account of what\'s going on when we get to the command center today.\xc2\xa0 They went through a series of different scenarios.\xc2\xa0 The President asked what was the latest on -- our first, our biggest priority was just capping the well.\xc2\xa0 So I didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it is a serious situation. I don\'t know that I -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it necessarily a worsening situation except that it continues to be a very serious situation with a lot of oil leaking into the Gulf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On New York, can you talk a little bit about the incident -- I mean, are you convinced this is lone incident --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into assumptions about different -- I\'m not going to get into assumptions about who might be involved or what their motives might be.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an ongoing investigation that Mr. Brennan is keeping track of with NYPD and the FBI.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything new on the capping effort?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, again, they went through a series of things on efforts that are being made at those depths to get the machinery to work on the floor.\xc2\xa0 The President got updates on efforts that BP has to essentially -- the best thing I\'ve heard it\'s called basically putting a funnel on top of the pipe connected to the surface, the part that vacuums up the oil and a host of different things like that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously Thad Allen, the national coordinator, spoke yesterday during a teleconference on a test that was run yesterday about the releasing of dispersants not on the surface, as has been done throughout the course of this, but instead releasing those dispersants near the source of the leak.\xc2\xa0 Those were tests that he characterized as promising yesterday, and another test I believe is scheduled for today on that technique.</p>\n<p>So that\'s something that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been tried before.\xc2\xa0 I think it goes to show that we are trying everything that we know and even some things that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been tried before in order to take the steps necessary to deal with the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any members of Congress down here --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But I will double-check.\xc2\xa0 I know there were some members yesterday that took over-flights, but I\'m not aware of any members today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Time Square incident, can you talk a little bit more about what Secretary Napolitano said on the talk shows today that there\'s a possibility that this is connected to terrorism?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say, without getting, again, into characterizing who might be involved or what those motives might be, obviously she had said this is an extremely serious situation and we\'re looking at investigating all those possibilities in conjunction -- obviously we are supportive of the efforts, and helpful to the efforts that NYPD are doing through the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is another close one for you guys.\xc2\xa0 Christmas Day almost had an incident; this bomb almost went off, but didn\'t.\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that the next one is going to be one that actually --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Anne, that\'s a concern that we deal with every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just rereading some of the reports you all put during the week about the spill, and on Thursday there was one that said, "After several unsuccessful attempts it has become clear BP has to step up what they\'re doing."\xc2\xa0 Was the focus sort of early on on the capping, and was there a point where you sort of said, oh, gee, the capping has not going to work, we\'re going to have to really deal with this as a --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it would be wrong to characterize the response or any effort of the response as being only focused on one thing.\xc2\xa0 I think generally you\'ve got several things.\xc2\xa0 One, you\'ve got to cap this well.\xc2\xa0 Two, you\'ve got to deal with the oil that has come up and is on the surface and that is spreading. With that, you have to deal with the devastation that could potentially be caused for local communities, for the economic implications, whether it\'s shipping or fishing, the environmental impacts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think there are, and there have been since the beginning of this -- look, the first response from the Coast Guard and the Navy to this incident was to search for those on the rig that were missing -- there are 11 that are now presumed dead as a result of the explosion and the ensuing fire.\xc2\xa0 So there has been a response effort that has been focused on all of those different aspects of this emergency, and we had planned from the beginning for a worse-case scenario, and we have made -- and our actions have led from there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is the President meeting with in Venice today?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get a full list of all the folks the President will see.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll keep you guys up to date on who he sees and all that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President hopeful that something will come out of the meetings that he\'s having today, that it will address the urgent situation right now?\xc2\xa0 Or is he --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\'s a series of actions -- and I\'ll get you some information -- I believe there were going to be some announcements about fishing and fisheries sometime during our flight that will obviously impact communities and the local economy and the ability for those impacted to seek some -- to seek compensation for that from the party responsible, which is BP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, look, I think the President -- the President has asked this team since the beginning of this incident to do everything humanly possible as aggressively as we can, to manage and deal with this emergency.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\'s here today to make sure that we are continuing to do all that is humanly possible, focusing on, as I said, many different aspects, whether it\'s capping the well, whether it\'s dealing with the spill as it gets to the surface, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s take one more, and then I\'ve got to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Supreme Court taking a backseat to this, or is the process still ongoing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s still ongoing, but I don\'t have any updates on the President\'s involvement --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has been most involved in this -- as he focuses on this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s doing a lot of different things.</p>\n<p>We should all sit down before we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he say something on New York?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Likely will say something at the top of remarks.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:26 P.M.
