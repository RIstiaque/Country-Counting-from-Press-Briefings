Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:57 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements at the top.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the President sent a letter last month to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader talking about the shared interests that the U.S. and Iran has in the fight against the Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that that letter was sent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to discuss private correspondence between the President and any world leader.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the policy that the President and his administration have articulated about Iran remains unchanged.\xc2\xa0 The United States is engaged in conversations with Iran in the context of the P5-plus-1 talks to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and we have also discussed on the sidelines of those talks on at least a couple of occasions the ongoing campaign that is being conducted against ISIL by the United States and 60 members of -- or now more than 60 members who are part of this broader coalition.</p>\n<p>The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran in that effort; we won\'t share intelligence with them.\xc2\xa0 But their interests in this outcome is something that\'s been widely commented upon and something on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since we know that there has been communication between the U.S. and Iran, why can\'t you say if that communication happened at the level of the President and the Supreme Leader?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just because I\'m not in a position to talk about private correspondence that may or --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it wrong that there was a letter sent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to be in a position to talk about private correspondence between the President and another world leader.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on something the President said in his press conference yesterday about the AUMF that he is going to try to work on with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Does he actually think that it\'s legally necessary to get a new authorization because of what he foresees about either the length or what this mission will entail going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Congress has already given him all of the authority that he needs to conduct this campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That authority was conferred by Congress on the President when they passed the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force.\xc2\xa0 According to a wide variety of administration lawyers, the President has the authority that he needs, based on that piece of legislation that Congress has already passed.</p>\n<p>But what the President has said is that he believes that it is beneficial to the broader effort if we send a very clear signal to the international community, both to our allies and to our enemies, that the executive branch and the legislative branch are on the same page when it comes to the strategy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President believes that it would be very helpful for Congress to pass an authorization to use military force to essentially right-size and modernize the authority that Congress gives to the President to reflect the conflict that we\'re currently waging.\xc2\xa0 And the President thinks that would be good for the country and would be beneficial to our broader effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even if lawmakers can\'t come to an agreement with the President about a new AUMF, he\xe2\x80\x99s still going to press forward with this mission?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change any plans?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct, because Congress has already given him this authority in 2001 when they passed the Authorization to Use Military Force that year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow up on one other thing, he talked, on Keystone, about letting the process play out, waiting for the\xc2\xa0 Nebraska supreme court decision before completing the administration review.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that if Congress sends him a bill authorizing construction of the pipeline before that internal administration review is complete that he would veto that legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\'t seen sort of what Congress is prepared to do specifically on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we know lawmakers have said -- McConnell and Boehner have said that is a top priority.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And the President has been very clear that there is an established -- a firmly established precedent for dealing with these kinds of issues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a process that currently is winding its ways through the State Department and one that, right now, is at least going to be influenced by the decision from a Nebraska judge about the proper route for that pipeline through that state.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider any sort of proposals that are passed by Congress, including a rider like this, that -- you\xe2\x80\x99re right -- does seem to pretty directly contradict the position that\xe2\x80\x99s been adopted by this administration, but also the position that\xe2\x80\x99s been taken by previous administrations as they\xe2\x80\x99ve considered pipelines of this sort.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just to follow up on that, what do you mean by \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll consider\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the question was, will he veto something that would force his hand on Keystone?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, and I guess my point is they haven\xe2\x80\x99t put forward something like that that has gotten a majority of both houses of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they probably will.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they have signaled so.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 And at that point we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to give you a more specific reaction to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Following up on a few other things that the President talked about yesterday -- he mentioned trade as something that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to get done with a Republican-controlled Congress.\xc2\xa0 What specifically would he like to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk on a number of occasions, in fact, in a variety of countries, about his view that the American economy would benefit from efforts to open up foreign markets -- additional foreign markets to American products; that American businesses and American workers are churning out high-quality products that are very competitive, and the more opportunities that we can open up for those products and for those goods and services overseas, the greater potential exists for those countries to grow and thrive and even create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The bottom line is, agreements to open up additional markets that include protections for American workers and American businesses, American farmers, can be beneficial to our economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President has --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- specific, though, about what he\xe2\x80\x99d like?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously in a midst of negotiations with a range of countries both in Asia and in Latin America about a potential transpacific partnership agreement.\xc2\xa0 The United States trade representative, Mike Froman, has indicated that those talks on ongoing, that they have made tremendous progress in trying to hammer out an agreement like that.\xc2\xa0 There are a few important issues that remain, and in the context of these negotiations, they have kicked all of the most difficult sticking points to the very end.</p>\n<p>So they\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress, but there are still some important sticking points that remain.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have any announcement along these lines in the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Asia.</p>\n<p>The President and his team are obviously engaged in conversations with some of our partners in Europe about a potential trade agreement between the United States and some European countries.\xc2\xa0 Those are in addition to some trade agreements that were completed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term with Panama and South Korea, as well.</p>\n<p>So the President has demonstrated a pretty firm commitment to this principle that it is possible for us to reach agreements with other countries that open up overseas markets in a way that benefits American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And we can reach those agreements without disadvantaging American workers, American entrepreneurs, American farmers, or other interests that are critical to the success of our domestic economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with lawmakers tomorrow, will he seek any assurances that he can stick in his pocket for his Asia trip on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this, among other opportunities for Democrats and Republicans to work together on issues of -- where they have common ground, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the President necessarily would be seeking any sort of handshake agreement on anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly on that, can you give us any more details about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, when, what will be served?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You alluded to the fact that they will be having lunch.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s on the menu.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke about what\xe2\x80\x99s on the menu there, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to resist the urge to make that joke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bourbon?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For example.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of them.\xc2\xa0 We can probably do a top-ten list I guess of things that could be on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what we can do in terms of giving you some more details about that lunch.\xc2\xa0 It will take place in the afternoon, as that\xe2\x80\x99s the hour that lunch is traditionally served. And we\xe2\x80\x99re still working on how we\xe2\x80\x99ll set up press access to that meeting, as well.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details on that soon.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask -- the President said that he heard the message of the election, but he also said, \xe2\x80\x9cI also heard the two-thirds who didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was asked this in a television interview that I did earlier today.\xc2\xa0 The point that the President was making is that citizens typically, when they step into the voting booth, will choose among candidates for office, but those citizens who don\xe2\x80\x99t show up to vote are also making a decision -- they\xe2\x80\x99re also making a decision to say -- to not participate.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President, and I think most other people here at the White House, that those individuals are sending a similar message, which is that they feel that Washington has not been sufficiently attuned to the concerns that they have, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the kind of results out of Washington, D.C. over the last two years that reflect the priorities and concerns that Americans all across the country have.</p>\n<p>And the President, as he did in the news conference yesterday, certainly has indicated that as the President of the United States, the most powerful person in Washington, that he has greater responsibility and is held to a higher standard of accountability for the failures of this town.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President redouble his efforts to make progress and to actually show some results to the American people, and that the voices of those who participated in the election were heard just as loud and clearly here at the White House as those who chose not to participate in the election at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there seems to be a suggestion there that the mandate that Republicans would have from this win would be something less.\xc2\xa0 I mean, just to drill down on your math, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s math, he says about a third voted, two-thirds didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote -- numbers are still coming in, but let\xe2\x80\x99s take that.\xc2\xa0 That would mean that because Republicans got a little bit more than half, that ultimately about a sixth of the population voted for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that five-sixths of the population out there, in the White House view, somehow was not with the Republicans on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s not the point that the President was trying to make.\xc2\xa0 There may be some who are making that point. I don\'t think that\'s the point the President was making.\xc2\xa0 I think the point the President was making is that people who choose not to participate in the election were also making a choice, and they were also sending a very clear signal to Washington, D.C. that Washington, D.C. feels far removed from their concerns and from their priorities and that they want their leaders to start producing some results; to start churning out the kinds of policies that will be beneficial to middle-class families; that they want Democrats and Republicans to figure out a way to identify common ground.</p>\n<p>It doesn\'t mean that they want their elected representatives to fold on their principles.\xc2\xa0 Certainly not at all.\xc2\xa0 But I do think they expect their elected representatives to try to find common ground and move on common ground that is clearly in the best interests of the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you remember back during the days when the government shutdown was dominating the news.\xc2\xa0 The President said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\'t like a particular policy, go out and win an election.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So apparently those who didn\'t like a lot of particular policies went out and they won a bunch of elections.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\'t that suggest that there should be some course correction here in terms of policy?\xc2\xa0 I know the President talked about spending some more time with the Republican leaders, but I didn\'t hear any suggestion of any change in any actual policy direction.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think that there is ample data to indicate that a lot of the policies that the President himself has advocated are strongly supported by those who participated in the election; that from support for a path to citizenship for immigrants who have been in this country for an extended period of time, to the President\xe2\x80\x99s handling of things like Ebola or ISIL, that there\xe2\x80\x99s strong support for what the President has pursued.\xc2\xa0 Even when it comes to an issue like the economy, the electorate -- again, those who actually participated in the election were split evenly between Democrats and Republicans in terms of appraising their handling of that particular policy area.</p>\n<p>Now, these results are notable for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is, as you pointed out, that the electorate skewed Republican, that more Republicans showed up.\xc2\xa0 But yet according to the findings of these exit polls, there is strong support for some of the priorities and policies that the President has carried out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not suggesting the results of this election are a reaffirmation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies, are you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just did.\xc2\xa0 You just went through --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what you suggested as a question.\xc2\xa0 And certainly you\'re entitled to raise that question.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that I think that the clear message that is sent by voters across the country is they want to see results in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Democrats and Republicans -- anybody who has been paying any attention to Washington, D.C. has seen that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten that much done in the last two years.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that the President has evinced some frustration about.\xc2\xa0 There are members of Congress who have expressed some frustration about that.\xc2\xa0 Clearly the voters are frustrated about that.</p>\n<p>And as the President of the United States, the most powerful person in Washington, D.C., the President bears greater accountability and responsibility for that than anybody else.\xc2\xa0 And he understands that.\xc2\xa0 And part of the reason that he has asked the 16 most powerful members of Congress to come to the White House for a meeting is he wants to start right away, looking for opportunities to cooperate and to find common ground and help move the country forward.</p>\n<p>Again, it doesn\'t mean that we\'re going to agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be plenty of things for us to disagree about.\xc2\xa0 But if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to find some common ground, let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that our differences don\'t get in the way of us being able to make some progress for the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, is there a date for the Bourbon Summit with Mitch McConnell?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not yet, but stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that.\xc2\xa0 After the 2010 elections, there was a policy correction, and the President did start emphasizing deficit reduction, and worked very, very hard -- many go-rounds with the Republican leadership on that; didn\'t come to anything.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that experience --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do think that it came to a couple of important things, Mara.\xc2\xa0 One thing is that we actually have exceeded the targets that were set for deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The deficit has been more than cut in half since the President took office, and the deficit is now below 3 percent of GDP, which was the original goal of those conversations, which was to bring the deficit down below that level.\xc2\xa0 So there was no broad or grand bargain that was struck, but there was important progress made in terms of reducing the deficit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess my question was you did try a change after the last time you lost a house of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there were some lessons you drew from that experience that makes you not want to do the same -- take the same kind of strategy this time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s an interesting question.\xc2\xa0 I guess the reason that\'s a hard question to answer is that there has been a national election in the intervening period, where there was an opportunity for us to have a debate across the country about what sort of issues should take priority and what kind of steps Washington should take to advance those priorities.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to draw a straight line between this midterm election and the last midterm election just because there was a national election between them.</p>\n<p>But I think, as a general matter, what you heard from the President at the news conference yesterday is a genuine openness to changing the way that he does business if it makes it more likely that Republicans will be willing to seize common ground with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 The President joked about this yesterday, but how much -- he said stuff isn\xe2\x80\x99t getting done, people are frustrated.\xc2\xa0 But how much of what happened on Tuesday do you think was because of just the sheer screw-ups -- I mean, he made the joke about the website yesterday -- and the VA and examples of just incompetence that people see?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mara, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave sort of a lot of that punditry and analysis to those of you who are actually pundits and analysts.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about the message that the President heard from the electorate.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that you see a pretty optimistic posture from people at the White House here is that I think that we see a similar read from the electorate being shared by Senator McConnell.</p>\n<p>One of the things -- I had the opportunity to read the transcript of Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s news conference from yesterday. I did not get a chance to see it live.\xc2\xa0 But one thing that he said stuck out to me, and I think it stuck out to those of you who were covering it.\xc2\xa0 What Senator McConnell said is, \xe2\x80\x9cI think there are a lot of people who believe that just because you have divided government it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish anything.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think the vast majority of us here at the White House, and certainly the President himself, agrees wholeheartedly.</p>\n<p>Senator McConnell didn\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to fold on his principles.\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to do that either.\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we should use that as an excuse not to get something done where we do agree.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit that we were pleased to see Senator McConnell express yesterday, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit with which the leaders of Congress will be sitting down with the President tomorrow to discuss their priorities.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, I was wondering what the White House thought of the comments made by Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did see the Post story about this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they actually reflect the true nature of the relationship that exists between President Obama and Senator Reid, then Senator Obama, when he served in the United States Senate, and Senator Reid struck up a genuine friendship when the two men served together in the United States Senate, and that relationship has only been strengthened during the President\xe2\x80\x99s time in the White House -- from issues like Wall Street reform to the Affordable Care Act, to ensuring that the American economy didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over the abyss into a second Great Depression -- that the success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on those fronts would not have been possible without the leadership of Senator Reid.</p>\n<p>And that very constructive, productive relationship even continued into the first couple of years of the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term as the Senate made progress in confirming judicial nominees that were offered up by the President, that we have seen 280 federal judges that have been confirmed over the last five and a half years or so, including a couple of Supreme Court justices.\xc2\xa0 And that will be part of Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s legacy and continues to be an indication of the kind of important partnership that exists between President Obama and Senator Reid. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, not to quibble with you, but I mean, this is a story that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of your job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 This is a story that obviously they have worked with the Post with for weeks; it said so in the story.\xc2\xa0 It was retweeted by a Reid spokesman multiple times.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, David Krone is married to a former top official here in the White House.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was not a subtle sort of jab at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, how could you not take this as representing a serious frustration with the White House from Leader Reid about what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, you can go ask some staffers in Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s office about their opinion.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m going to point to are actually the results of what has I think been fairly observed by others as a genuinely historic relationship between the President of the United States and the Senate Majority Leader -- in this case, President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- that again, from Wall Street reform to the Affordable Care Act, to saving the economy from a second Great Depression, that involves passing important pieces of legislation.</p>\n<p>Again, some of these pieces of legislation were vigorously opposed by Republicans in the United States Senate, and it required Senator Reid demonstrating the kind of leadership you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from somebody who has the title of Senate Majority Leader to get these things done.\xc2\xa0 And that relationship between Senator Reid and the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t just good for the two men, it\xe2\x80\x99s been good for the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask it one other way.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken about needing to change his attitude or approach towards John Boehner, Mitch McConnell.\xc2\xa0 With Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s top aides blasting him in major newspapers, does he need to change his approach towards Harry Reid?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any type of new approach or outreach, especially on issues like access to donors and things like that that were raised in the story?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say I guess what I said to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, which is it does apply to Democrats, too -- that if the President, based on the conversations that he has with members of Congress in both parties will be at the meeting tomorrow, finds that there are some things that he can change to make that relationship with Congress more productive, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to make those changes.</p>\n<p>Now, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make those changes just for the sake of changing things up for his last two years in office.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s willing to make changes if it will lead to more progress for the American people.\xc2\xa0 If it will allow us to have greater success in passing common-sense pieces of legislation that will benefit middle-class families, then, yes, the President is willing to do some things differently.\xc2\xa0 Those might be the kinds of things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t readily available to the public, that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t easily identifiable, but if they are the kinds of changes that will actually result in progress, the President is more than open to making them.</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Back to Republicans, though.\xc2\xa0 So after all this outreach and kind words yesterday, there\xe2\x80\x99s a Wall Street Journal op-ed this morning that says the first thing -- among the first things that Republicans want to do, McConnell and Boehner, is repeal Obamacare, pass Keystone pipeline approval, take up a bunch of bills that the Senate -- passed in the House and the Senate won\xe2\x80\x99t pass.\xc2\xa0 How do you really see moving forward if these are their priorities?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Cheryl, those aren\xe2\x80\x99t their only priorities.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell, again, in his news conference that I spent a little time reading about very early this morning, pointed out a couple of issues that he considers to be priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that he can work with the White House on.\xc2\xa0 He identified expanding exports through trade and tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Those are issues that the White House has talked about.\xc2\xa0 These are issues that the President has talked about as priorities.</p>\n<p>So again, the important thing is the President is not going to change his view -- his very dim view of legislation that would be motivated to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have voted for that legislation 50 or 60 times now.\xc2\xa0 Now that Senator McConnell is the Majority Leader, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have more influence about what pieces of legislation come to the floor of the United States Senate, and if he chooses to bring legislation like that to the floor, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly entitled to make those decisions.\xc2\xa0 What the President is determined to do, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful Republicans will do, is not allow our very clear, well-established differences get in the way of our ability to identify, seize and advance common ground.</p>\n<p>That ultimately is the message that the voters were sending, at least in the mind of the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think, reading Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s news conference yesterday, that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking, too.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to have disagreements.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to minimize or paper those over.\xc2\xa0 But what the President is eager to do in his last two years in office is to ensure that those differences of opinion don\xe2\x80\x99t crowd out the ability to cooperate when we have a shared point of view.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just following up, actually, on the question.\xc2\xa0 You have the op-ed that was just referenced of President Obama saying that he still plans to take executive action, something that a lot of Republicans have said is basically a declaration of war.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re an American voter, why should you have confidence that anything is going to be different now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that time will tell.\xc2\xa0 And I think American voters can have confidence that the President is going to continue to look for common ground, as he has over the last six years.</p>\n<p>And for some reason -- and I guess not without some justification, given the outcome of the elections -- Republicans have concluded, or at least had concluded, that it was in their own personal political interest to oppose every single thing that the President wanted to do.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of gone through the litany of examples where that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case.\xc2\xa0 And over that six years, Republicans have gained seats in the legislature.\xc2\xa0 So maybe that means they feel pretty validated in terms of their political strategy, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s been good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a good strategy in terms of the standing of the Republican brand.</p>\n<p>But now that the deck has been reshuffled here and you have Republicans who are leading not just the House of Representatives but now the United States Senate, maybe it will prompt Republicans to reevaluate their strategy.\xc2\xa0 Maybe now they will conclude that it\xe2\x80\x99s in their political interest to try to find areas of common ground with the President.\xc2\xa0 And if so, I think that could make for a productive relationship.</p>\n<p>Again, there are going to be areas of strong disagreement, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to minimize them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody else is either.\xc2\xa0 But maybe Republicans will change their tune.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they will decide that they should, based on their own political interest, based on their interest for the country or some other interest, will decide that they actually want to try to find common ground with the President.\xc2\xa0 And if they do, they will find a very willing partner sitting in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President reads that op-ed, is there not concern that this process is just going to get bogged down, though, in fighting, defending the health care act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point is it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to.\xc2\xa0 That differences over health care are well worn, and I think that the President is pretty confident the way that history will evaluate those differences.\xc2\xa0 But that, frankly, is not really something we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about or focused on right now.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is trying to find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 And we can have our differences of opinion over the Affordable Care Act; maybe there will be colorful debates on the floor of the Senate or on the floor of the House.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on that is not just well known to everybody here at the White House, the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on these issues is well known to everybody in Congress, too.</p>\n<p>So again, it\xe2\x80\x99s their decision, however, if they decide that they want to bring up these pieces of legislation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly entitled to that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 They have earned that right based on the outcome of the elections.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, and I think what the President -- the message that the President delivered in the news conference and that he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver privately at the lunch tomorrow, is let\xe2\x80\x99s not let these differences crowd out our ability to cooperate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And next week he goes to Asia, obviously, just as Congress is coming back.\xc2\xa0 How does he -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s having lunch with them tomorrow, but is there any concern that that takes away from this effort to find common ground?\xc2\xa0 Will he be reaching out to lawmakers while he\xe2\x80\x99s overseas, for example?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any conference calls or any emails or anything else that the President will send or receive to communicate with members of Congress during his important trip to Asia.\xc2\xa0 But the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he has tomorrow to really get started -- of trying to forge this common ground with Republicans over the course of the next couple of months, but also leading into the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Josh, let me just get one not having to do with Washington.\xc2\xa0 Former Illinois Representative Lane Evans passed away.\xc2\xa0 He was obviously influential in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s career. Does he have a reaction?\xc2\xa0 Has he reached out to any of his family members, for example?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a statement from the President on this issue later today.\xc2\xa0 But there are many of us here at the White House who had the opportunity to meet Congressman Evans, and I had the opportunity to meet him on the campaign trail very early on -- I believe in 2007 -- and he is somebody who was a longtime supporter and friend of the President, and he was one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s earliest supporters not just in the presidential campaign but actually when then-state senator Obama decided to run for the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>Congressman Evans is somebody who served his country proudly in the United States Marines.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who was very conscious of his commitment to serving his country throughout his career in public service.\xc2\xa0 And those are the kinds of values that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss, and certainly we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss Congressman Evans.\xc2\xa0 Our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, were you surprised that in the op-ed that Kristen mentioned, where the Republican leaders lay out their agenda?\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to me they mention immigration reform at all.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I guess I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read the op-ed expecting a surprise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is something the President has been highlighting for a long time.\xc2\xa0 The Republican leaders say they want to work with him; McConnell had that news conference saying we\xe2\x80\x99re going to find common ground and they lay out all these economic plans, and something the President is saying is front and center is not highlighted.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised that there may be things that the President considers to be top priorities that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t share.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to paper over those differences.\xc2\xa0 What we have to do is we need to compare those two lists.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s put down the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, let\xe2\x80\x99s place down right next to it the Republican agenda, and let\xe2\x80\x99s look for areas of common ground.</p>\n<p>I mean, the truth is people have sort of been saying, well, the two sides need to do more to compromise.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 But we can actually even start in an easier place.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just start by trying to find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 There are some things where we don\'t have to compromise because we both agree that they\'re good for the country.</p>\n<p>One example of this would be infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of Republican members of Congress who believe that there are worthwhile infrastructure projects in their districts.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees, by and large, that a lot of those projects actually are worthy of investment, that that would be good for the local economy in those communities, that it would be -- both in the short term and the long term.</p>\n<p>So that\'s just sort of one example where there probably is more -- Washington would probably benefit from a greater spirit of compromise in this town.\xc2\xa0 But we can even start in an easier place, which is let\xe2\x80\x99s go find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 There are things we agree on, and let\xe2\x80\x99s move on them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One reason you held back on an executive order on immigration was that there was a fear Democrats had that they\xe2\x80\x99d lose the Senate if, with a big issue like that, the President took unilateral action shortly before the midterms.\xc2\xa0 Democrats -- well, at least that was expressed by --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 By some senators, yes.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the view of the White House, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not why you did it, you said.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Senate Democrats were concerned about it happening before the election.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did not do it.\xc2\xa0 He held it till after the midterms.\xc2\xa0 Democrats lost the Senate anyway.\xc2\xa0 And now you have some on the left -- Congressman Guterriez had a news conference the day after the election blasting the President, saying that Hispanics had been sold out, he should have acted much sooner.\xc2\xa0 And my question being, is there any regret here that it was held back after the election?\xc2\xa0 Democrats who complained it might hurt them in the election, they lost anyway.\xc2\xa0 And now you have Republicans with an even bigger majority in the Senate than you or they expected.\xc2\xa0 And as Kristen said, they\'re warning you, you go ahead now, after the election, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a declaration of war.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me unpack a couple of things, Ed.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve raised an important question.\xc2\xa0 The thing that\'s -- as the President was considering this decision earlier this summer, the thing that the President was most focused on was protecting the issue of immigration reform, and making sure that it was an issue that continued to be a viable one in Washington, D.C., one that\'s viable in the United States Congress, one that has bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is had the President made this decision in the months before the election, that had the election turned out the same way, we would be sitting here discussing how the issue of immigration would be dead for a long time because Republicans would be running around saying, because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive action, I was successful in my election and I will never support immigration reform again.</p>\n<p>But we don\'t have people saying that.\xc2\xa0 Instead what we have is we have the President, who still has the capacity to act on his own using this executive authority to solve many of the problems associated with our broken immigration system, and the President is determined to move forward on that before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, on another issue -- to go back to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s questions about Iran.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about Congress, you\'ve been saying you want to find common ground with them and let\xe2\x80\x99s do the easy things we can work on together.\xc2\xa0 Why then send a secret letter to the Ayatollah when Congress is saying we want a voice in these nuclear talks, for example, that we don\'t want to be cut out?\xc2\xa0 If you\'re sending a secret letter, it sounds like you\'re not being transparent and you\'re cutting Congress out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I recognize that it may sound that way, but the fact of the matter is there are also secret conversations between the administration and Congress about our negotiating strategy with Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been read in on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to detail those secret conversations either.\xc2\xa0 But I am in a position to tell you that senior administration officials have been and continue to be in very close touch with relevant members of Congress about the progress that we\'re making on these P5-plus-1 talks.\xc2\xa0 They are critical to American national security.</p>\n<p>And I\'ll do a short version of this, but it\'s important.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\'t have made as much progress as we have so far in forcing Iran to the negotiating table and considering some very serious decisions had the President and the Congress not been able to work together in imposing a sanctions regime on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Congress passed a set of very tough sanctions against Iran with bipartisan support, and this administration and our skilled diplomats implemented those sanctions in a way to maximize the impact on the Iranian economy in a way that forces the Iranian negotiators to the table.</p>\n<p>So the administration and Congress -- in some ways, this would actually be one of those rare spots where the administration and Congress, members in both parties, have succeeded in working well together to represent the interest of the United States of America, in fact, to advance our interests.\xc2\xa0 And that kind of consultation continues, and it will as we approach this deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That kind of working together would go much smoother if you also said up front that Congress is going to be able to vote and approve this, rather than you might read them in after you cut a deal.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not saying that we\'re going to read them in after we cut a deal.\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that we\'ve been reading them in as we\'ve been trying to negotiate this deal.\xc2\xa0 Again, we welcome the contribution that members of Congress have played in this effort so far, and it is important for members of Congress to be consulted regularly as we make progress, certainly as we get close to the deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 This letter was allegedly written in part to bring Iran in to help fight ISIS, beyond the nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 President Rouhani told CNN in an interview last month that he thinks the airstrikes so far against ISIS have been a form of theater and it\'s not a serious campaign against terrorists.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, how can the President believe that Iran is a credible partner here when they\xe2\x80\x99re attacking his campaign against ISIS and saying it\'s not serious?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, just as a factual matter, the fact is that we have seen the airstrikes that have been conducted by the United States and many of our coalition partners actually have an impact on their ability to operate in this area of the world.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen them change their tactics.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a story in The New York Times today about how the success that ISIL -- the momentum that ISIL had built up had waned in recent months in part due to the military campaign that the United States and our military partners is waging against them.\xc2\xa0 So as a factual matter, what you say he said is not true.</p>\n<p>What is true, though, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear interest that Iran has in this fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not in the interest of Iran or, frankly, anybody else in this region of the world to have this extremist group rampaging across the countryside carrying out terrible acts of violence.</p>\n<p>So, that said, because of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the rest of the world, for a variety of reasons, it\'s difficult for the United States to work very closely with Iran in this endeavor.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'re not cooperating with them militarily; we\'re not sharing intelligence with them.\xc2\xa0 But we do seek to -- at least we have on a couple of occasions sought to engage them on the sidelines of other talks to make sure that they understand what we\'re trying to do here and to get a sense about their perspective on things.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about something that CNN first reported yesterday that we\'ve been checking with the Army and the Office of Management and Budget about.\xc2\xa0 It talks about this Army command policy regulation, published October 22nd, that says that the term \xe2\x80\x9cNegro\xe2\x80\x9d can be used to describe a black or African American member of the Army.\xc2\xa0 It says that this is something that dates back to OMB regulations from the mid-\xe2\x80\x9890s.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve checked with OMB; they\xe2\x80\x99re circling back and trying to find out the origin of this.\xc2\xa0 Since CNN reported this, the Army has now taken that designation out of this command policy.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the President believes that it should be stricken from all federal documents and the Office of Management and Budget -- which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten back to me on this -- is working on that very task right now.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that OMB is looking into this matter.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.\xc2\xa0 And I do want to underscore something you said, which is that the military has updated the policy as of today and that language that\'s in question is no longer being used.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we believe that\'s an appropriate step.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to its application in other areas of the government, that\'s something that OMB is still reviewing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was this entirely a Pentagon decision, or did the White House or the President himself get involved in this particular topic?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I\'d check with the Pentagon on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, is the conversation principally about what to accomplish in the lame duck, or in the next Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Both.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who will set the agenda for the second part of that conversation, the Republicans or the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you can expect, Major, is you can anticipate that the President has on his mind a few things that he believes should be priorities.\xc2\xa0 And he discussed some of them in the news conference yesterday -- from additional funding for our efforts to fight Ebola, and AUMF --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s in the lame duck, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President indicated that the AUMF discussion could extend beyond the lame duck period.\xc2\xa0 The President has also been clear about some of the economic priorities that he has.\xc2\xa0 So the President is eager to talk about some of the things that are on his agenda.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just as eager to hear from Republicans and to hear what\xe2\x80\x99s on their agenda, to hear them lay out the priorities that they have both for the lame duck as well as for the next two years.\xc2\xa0 So this will be an opportunity for the President to hear from Republicans about where their priorities are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Justin\xe2\x80\x99s questions, let me just ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Do you or the Chief of Staff of this White House or the President believe there is anything that needs to be done to repair the relationship with Harry Reid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if there is, I\'m confident that\'s something that the President and Senator Reid, given their strong track record, will be able to take care of.\xc2\xa0 If they do that, I doubt it will be published in The Washington Post, frankly.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m confident that based on their long history that these two men, who have a very important role to play not just here in Washington, but in the country, are going to continue to have that strong kind of working relationship that\'s been so beneficial to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me tie these last two questions together.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe it is any way an obligation of his, next year or the year after, as the political leader of the Democratic Party, to assist Harry Reid in re-winning the majority in 2016, when a far greater number of Republicans will be facing reelection, many of them in states that the President carried if not once, twice, and the map, as the President referred to, will be far more beneficial, at least in theory, to Democrats than the one just concluded?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re right, Major, that unlike the midterm election that has just been completed, in 2016 there will be Senate contests hosted in a substantial number of states where the President has a strong electoral track record -- in many contests, they will be taking place in states the President has won twice.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that in 2016, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see an engaged President of the United States who is working hard to elect Democrats.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe it is necessary to name an attorney general before the President leaves for Asia in order that that candidate, whoever it is, be confirmed before the new Congress takes up its position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates in terms of timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking about who.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just asking do you believe in a timing sequence, you need to do this in order to get it done before the next Congress takes --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates in terms of timing about when sort of an announcement of this sort would be made.\xc2\xa0 But we have discussed in here the precedent that exists for Congress acting quickly in bipartisan fashion on nominees that have particularly significant national security or law enforcement responsibilities for the country.\xc2\xa0 So I am confident, as is the President, that whoever he nominates will be an individual with impeccable credentials, somebody who deserves close examination by the Senate, but also prompt confirmation in bipartisan fashion by the Senate.</p>\n<p>And the President certainly believes that that could occur in the lame duck or in the early months of next year.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have obviously a lot more to say about that once the President has made a decision about whom to nominate.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s question, there are a lot of other vacancies in the administration at high levels beyond the AG.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a new one today with the federal railroad administrator resigning.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to be a problem for the President to fill -- those positions during the lame duck?\xc2\xa0 And will that be part of the discussion tomorrow with the lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the need to ensure that public servants who have been nominated to important positions in the federal government should be confirmed promptly by the United States Senate, that the nominees that this President has put forward are nominees that we believe deserve bipartisan support, and we hope that the Senate will act quickly to confirm them into those positions and that some of those confirmations should occur during the lame duck session.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about nominees that haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet been put forward?\xc2\xa0 Will that be a priority for the President to get those out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Frankly, I don\'t know of any pending nominations that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been announced yet beyond a couple that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sort of speculate about what that ends up looking like.\xc2\xa0 But as announcements get made, it will be easier to discuss the appropriate timing.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, following up on Major\xe2\x80\x99s question, is there any explanation from the Army or from any other federal agency, as to why the word \xe2\x80\x9cNegro\xe2\x80\x9d is still being used on federal documentation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the military has updated their policy to remove that word from their policy.</p>\n<p>But there is this OMB regulation that exists.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the source of that or the reason that that\'s still in place.\xc2\xa0 But you can check with them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it ever explained the reason why it was used is because many Americans are older, from that era and still consider themselves -- was that ever explained to this White House?\xc2\xa0 Or were you told anything of that nature as to why it was still on the Army documentation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t know why a regulation that includes that language is still on the books.\xc2\xa0 But you can check with OMB because it\xe2\x80\x99s their regulation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also dealing with race, could you give us a little bit more information --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I should just clarify one other thing, which I understand this is a regulation that dates back 15 or 20 years, so this is not something that\'s new.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has been uncovered only recently after being on the books for a long time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, as we\'re still dealing with race, could you talk to us about this preplanned meeting yesterday with civil rights leaders and President Obama the day after the midterm election?\xc2\xa0 And we understand Ferguson was some of the topic.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did see that we put out a readout of that meeting late yesterday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 This was a meeting that was convened by Valerie Jarrett and a couple of other senior staffers here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President did have the opportunity to drop by that meeting.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the readout that we put out for discussion of -- or at least a sense of what was discussed in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the leaders, when they were seen walking out of the front gate, were saying some of the things that were discussed in the meeting, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you, was Ferguson discussed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend the meeting and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the readout.\xc2\xa0 But I know that we did put one out, and you can check out that to get an accurate sense of what was actually discussed in the meeting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, there seems to be a positive spin from this White House as it relates to the midterm election and the results from the election.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me a negative?\xc2\xa0 What negatively happened Tuesday night, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, versus -- (laughter) -- I mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on, here\xe2\x80\x99s your chance.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know, what happened?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got this sunny disposition even on a cloudy day -- both literally and figuratively.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>April, the -- well --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Try to -- go against your brain.\xc2\xa0 Do it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Channel Joe Manchin.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a family program, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll use a little better language than that I think.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>April, the President himself said last night that it was -- that the election was good for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of public servants from the Democratic Party who had served their states in Washington, D.C. very well, very capably, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t win, and some of these are individuals who the President got to know when he served in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 These are individuals that the President saw up close and personally how they handled their business and how they represented their constituents, and the President is disappointed that those individuals were not reelected to another term.</p>\n<p>That said, I think what the American people expect their leaders to do is to be resilient.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the American people are resilient.\xc2\xa0 And so I think we could take a lesson from them to understand that we got to get to work.</p>\n<p>And the truth is, if I were standing here bragging about how great the elections had gone, I\xe2\x80\x99d also be standing here telling you that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of really important work to do, that now is when the hard work begins.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true even if the elections didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out the way that we\xe2\x80\x99d hoped.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last take.\xc2\xa0 You tried, you\'re getting there.\xc2\xa0 Would you say that Tuesday night was a big loss for Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, in terms of the sort of punditry and analysis --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not punditry, it\xe2\x80\x99s a real question.\xc2\xa0 Because you guys spin it, and I mean, I understand why you\xe2\x80\x99re spinning it.\xc2\xa0 You acknowledged the win for --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- there are lots of people who get paid a lot more money than I do who are responsible for offering up analysis and spinning the elections, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on here, and what everybody here is focused on, is figuring out what we can do to work with Republicans and move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 And those are the lessons from the election, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re here to talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said it was good for Republicans, so it\'s bad for Democrats -- no?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that is the mentality of Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 I also think that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of mentality that voters aren\xe2\x80\x99t very happy about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it could be good for Democrats.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no -- (laughter) -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pass judgment on the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can say whether it\xe2\x80\x99s good -- you can say it\xe2\x80\x99s good for Republicans, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether it\xe2\x80\x99s good or bad for Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 It is, it is.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly disappointed in the outcome of the elections.\xc2\xa0 The President is, too.\xc2\xa0 I think I said that earlier in response to your earlier question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While were talking about how voters view all of this, well, now they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about these grand efforts to reach out and sit down and let\xe2\x80\x99s now find that common ground, and the President is open to doing things differently.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t the voter going to say, that\xe2\x80\x99s great but why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this done years ago?\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re blaming Republicans for that, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t more of this have been done on the part of the President, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Probably.\xc2\xa0 But I think that if you are -- anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s taken a fair look at the last six years would acknowledge that the President has gone to great lengths to try to compromise with Republicans, and Republicans themselves have acknowledged publicly on a variety of occasions, in sometimes very news-making ways, that their chief political goal was to defeat the President of the United States politically.\xc2\xa0 So this is not like a secret strategy that I\xe2\x80\x99m commenting on at some point.\xc2\xa0 This actually was the overt strategy of the Republicans, to try to block everything that the President did in the hopes that it would benefit them politically.</p>\n<p>And, look, they got a lot of seats out of it, right?\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the last six years, Republicans in both the House and the Senate went from being in the minority to being in the majority.\xc2\xa0 So they may be able to say with some credibility that they did benefit politically from obstructing the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda at every turn.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the country benefitted from that, though.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t just say that because Republicans are now in the majority.\xc2\xa0 I just think that there was a lot of very important things that didn\'t get done that could have, had the President found more willing partners among Republicans.</p>\n<p>The good news is -- that was a lot of darkness for you there, April.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The good news, though, is that the deck has been reshuffled.\xc2\xa0 There is now a Republican majority in the Senate; there is a Republican majority in the House.\xc2\xa0 And you could understand how this might change the political calculation that Republicans make.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they now see that it would be in their own personal, political interest to try to find some common ground with the President.\xc2\xa0 And if so, they will have a very willing partner in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And it will be good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t mean we\'re going to agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 But if there is an opportunity for us to find common ground, we are pleased that there might now actually be Republicans on the other side of the table who are willing to seize it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the criticisms that you hear from both Democrats and Republicans of the President, though, is that he has not reached out enough, that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t engaged enough.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys acknowledging that now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging that there probably is more that could have been done.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think that -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of been through this, right? -- that an extra cocktail party or another round of golf would have substantially changed the outcome.\xc2\xa0 But what will substantially change the outcome is a rededication on the part of this administration to try to find common ground with the Republicans, and a different political calculation that\'s made by Republicans to try to find common ground with the administration.</p>\n<p>And again, we\'re still going to have our differences.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that sometimes those differences will be on full display in very colorful ways.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it on display in this op-ed?\xc2\xa0 I mean almost the first line was \xe2\x80\x9crepeal Obamacare,\xe2\x80\x9d and then in the same breath, \xe2\x80\x9cour focus,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, was going to be on helping the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that all of that language negates now this spirit of finding common ground?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, because, again, I take Senator McConnell at his word, and he is somebody who said that just because you have divided government it doesn\'t mean you don\'t accomplish anything.</p>\n<p>So again, this is not -- the differing views of Republicans and the President on an issue like the Affordable Care Act is not news.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Republicans have had an opportunity to vote on the difference 50 or more times now.\xc2\xa0 The question is are we going to allow those differences to crowd out our ability to cooperate where there is a clear common interest?</p>\n<p>Again, when it comes to an issue like trade -- I guess the better example I think is infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to an issue like infrastructure, we\'re talking less about compromising and more about just cooperating.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Josh, the week ahead had the Cabinet meeting on the boards for tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that still happening?\xc2\xa0 Or are we just going to convene the group from the congressional delegation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A lot of meeting at the White House tomorrow. So we will have a Cabinet meeting in the morning, and then that will precede the congressional consultations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Subject of the Cabinet meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It will be an opportunity to talk through some of the priorities that the President laid out in the news conference yesterday?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about the Ebola request for additional Ebola-related resources.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about the AUMF and some other things.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout of the Cabinet meeting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe the AG announcement will be between those?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That would make for a very busy day, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, while you\'re taking congressional leaders at their word, both Senator McConnell yesterday in Louisville and Speaker Boehner in a briefing that overlapped with this one said that executive action on immigration reform would poison the well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask you for a water quality report, but is the President -- is that a risk the President is willing to take?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, I think the question that the President has before him is:\xc2\xa0 Should he take executive action that he believes would be good for the country, that economists believe would be good for our economy, that those along the border think would be good for our border security, and that advocates for immigrants think would be good for immigrants, and that business owners think would be good for business?\xc2\xa0 And so the question is, is the President going to take that action?\xc2\xa0 And the answer is, yes, the President is going to take that action.</p>\n<p>And again, if we\'re drawing conclusions or at least lessons from the outcome of the election, we think that the central lesson here is, what are the elected representatives of the American people in Washington, D.C. doing to produce results for them?\xc2\xa0 And one way that the President can generate results for the American people is to take this kind of common-sense, substantive action that will be good for the economy, will be good for the deficit, will be good for strengthening our border, and will be good for dealing with the millions of immigrants to this country that are currently in the shadows; that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in the context of Senate legislation, that asking these individuals to learn English, pay back-taxes, go to the back of the immigration line, but actually come out of the shadows is something that would be good for the economy and good for the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President,in campaign events for years, has been saying, don\'t boo, vote.\xc2\xa0 People booed; they didn\'t necessarily vote.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday he spoke -- he made a point to speak to the two-thirds of Americans who decided not to show up.\xc2\xa0 Is the President the leader of a coalition that doesn\'t vote?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean I\xe2\x80\x99ll say that the President is leader of a coalition of people who voted when he was on the ballot.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that -- both in 2008 and 2012.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not necessarily when other Democrats were on the ballot.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, not this time.\xc2\xa0 And so the question is, what can Democrats do moving forward?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, again, there will be people who have a lot more experience in elections than even I do who are going to be spending some time thinking about what the party apparatus can do to better appeal to those voters.</p>\n<p>I think that as an elected official in Washington, D.C. and as the leader of the country, the President is going to be spending some more time thinking about what can leaders in Washington, D.C. do to better demonstrate that they are committed to the priorities of the American people and how can we generate some progress and some results that make that clear to the American people.</p>\n<p>Again, when you walk into the voting booth, you have the opportunity to choose among candidates.\xc2\xa0 But to borrow the phrase of an academic economist, you can also vote with your feet.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of people voted with their feet by not showing up at the polling place on Election Day.\xc2\xa0 And that is a pretty clear expression that they\'re dissatisfied with the way that things are going in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>And the President, as the most powerful person in this town, feels a special responsibility -- a unique responsibility, he described it yesterday -- to fix it.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what we\'re going to try to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Despite a really historic drubbing on Tuesday -- I mean really historic -- Republicans have more legislatures in the states than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had before.\xc2\xa0 Up and down the line,\xc2\xa0 what the American people are going to see in Washington is Nancy Pelosi still hold House Minority Leader, Steny Hoyer, Harry Reid; the President not making any personnel changes.\xc2\xa0 Why not have any kind of shake-up at the top to tell the American people something is going to be different?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think again, the reason that I think that the American people can be at least a little optimistic about different results in Washington, D.C. is that they are going to see from their President a renewed commitment to working with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, and if necessary making changes that make that cooperation more likely.</p>\n<p>I also think, as I mentioned to Michelle, we may see a different political calculation made by Republicans that after six years of obstructing the President in a way that led to their own political benefit, that they may conclude that it\xe2\x80\x99s now in their political benefit to try to find some common ground with the President.</p>\n<p>And again, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there are going to be daily renditions of Kumbaya sung on Pennsylvania Avenue, but I do think that we can be at least a little more optimistic that where common ground exists, that Democrats and Republicans can move together on it.</p>\n<p>Again, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there won\xe2\x80\x99t be differences.\xc2\xa0 There will be.\xc2\xa0 And they will be expressed very colorfully, particularly in advance of the next elections.\xc2\xa0 But there is an opportunity here.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell, again, himself says that just because you have divided government it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you don\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish anything.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress started accomplishing things, that would be a change.\xc2\xa0 And I think that would be a change that would be evident to the American people.</p>\n<p>And the President is somebody who acknowledges that he has a very important role to play in all of that, and he is somebody who has taken responsibility for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failures on that front over the last two years, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take responsibility for trying to turn that around in the next two years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this President -- you yourself, you were predicting victory a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 The White House has been confident all year in its strategy, and it turns out that that was misplaced confidence.\xc2\xa0 Does he need to have more, different advisors?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk about how a lot of the people around him have been -- around him for a long time are tired, maybe should go somewhere else.\xc2\xa0 And he looked tired, frankly, to me in the second row yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Does he need --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was in like the fifth row, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President need to have some new blood to -- and maybe even bring in a Republican or two who actually can work with these guys over on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, the President is somebody who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make personnel changes just for cosmetic reasons.\xc2\xa0 And maybe that would generate a day or two of positive headlines if the President were to satisfy the need to publicly fire a couple of people, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way the President operates.</p>\n<p>The way the President operates is he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a look at his team and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to draw some conclusions about who he needs around him to advise him.\xc2\xa0 And again, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be some of my colleagues who will, as previous White House staffers have done, make a decision after a big election to decide that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to move on.\xc2\xa0 And those announcements will be -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what those announcements are at this point, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that some of my colleagues will have some announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 The point is that the President is more focused on results.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 Tuesday was a result.\xc2\xa0 And cosmetic changes is not what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about having -- the President, as you pointed out, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make things for cosmetic changes.\xc2\xa0 He has replaced a number of Cabinet secretaries this year.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s done some things where he said, I need a different person.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if he needs to have a substantive, real change in the way his leadership team works, the way his senior advisors work, how they work with the Hill, et cetera, if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling out is that there may be people who decide that they, after a long tenure at the White House, are ready to go do something else.</p>\n<p>What I am ruling out, though, would be sort of a large-scale public firing.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 And again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there are a lot of people who trudged into the voting booth, cast a ballot for a Republican, saying, I hope that sends a message to the President that he needs some new advisors at the White House.</p>\n<p>Those people cast that ballot -- or, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed a couple times in this briefing, didn\xe2\x80\x99t cast a ballot -- hoping to send a message to the President of the United States that he needed to get some more results.\xc2\xa0 And the President will consider a variety of ways that he can try to work with Congress to get more results.\xc2\xa0 I think the good news is I think a lot of Republicans are considering what they can do to get some more results for the American public.\xc2\xa0 And that I think is the kind of change that people are looking for.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we also see a little bit more from him either in the briefing room, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of -- I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of requests from the White House Correspondents Association that we actually see the President more, that he appear before the public more.\xc2\xa0 The point was made by Susan Page of USA Today recently, how\xe2\x80\x99s it working for the President of not having as many appearances and opportunities for off-the-cuff questions, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 Is that the sort of thing that he might be considering?\xc2\xa0 Yesterday we talked about maybe changing how he communicates to the public.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President did have an hour, almost an hour-and-fifteen-minute news conference yesterday, so I saw that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know it was kind of rare.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I also know that some people thought it was a little too long -- which is ironic given the question that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking now.</p>\n<p>I think the point is, I do think that the President is going to consider a variety of things that he could do differently, and if that means that he spends more time with you and he judges that that would be a good use of his time, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.</p>\n<p>And, again, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s more likely, however, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be an effort by those of you who work in this room who are responsible for holding the President accountable agitating to see the President more often and to have more opportunities to ask him questions.\xc2\xa0 And I think that over the last several months you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President take more questions, and even over the last couple of weeks when he\xe2\x80\x99s been convening meetings in the Oval Office, he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a question in the setting that you were just describing -- a more casual, informal, off-the-cuff Q&amp;A.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been doing more of that lately.</p>\n<p>I recognize that, from your standpoint, you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the President do more of that.\xc2\xa0 Maybe he will.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that the President believes that communicating with all of you and making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s held to a standard of accountability by all of you is an important part of his job and one that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to fulfill.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see everybody tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who thought the news conference was too long?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 We may have to have a little accounting of that, won\xe2\x80\x99t we?</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:03 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
