Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">2:15 P.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, in my endeavoring pursuit to bring you special guests, today obviously we have the Secretary of Commerce, Gary Locke, who is going to talk to you guys and give you a little bit of an update on the impending deadline of the transition for digital television, which takes place at the end of this week.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Mr. Secretary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 And today I\'m here to remind Americans about the impending national switch to digital television.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just two days away, Friday, June 12th.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In February, President Obama signed the DTV Delay Act, which set June 12th as the final deadline for television broadcasters to transition from analog to digital signals.\xc2\xa0 The President acted out of concerns for the millions of Americans who would have been left in the dark if the conversion had gone on as planned.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Commerce Department and the FCC have been spearheading efforts to ensure all Americans are ready for the switchover, and great progress has been made in just the last three months since Recovery Act funds were made available.\xc2\xa0 But with the deadline fast approaching, some people are still unprepared, some 2.5 percent of American households, or 2.8 million households.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here is what the American people need to know about the June 12th switchover:\xc2\xa0 If you currently have cable, satellite, or some other paid-for television service, you have nothing to worry about.\xc2\xa0 You are prepared; you don\'t need to do anything, and June 12th you\'ll see no change in your television reception or programming.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you have a new television set purchased, let\'s say, within the last one year, those new television sets come automatically with a digital tuner.\xc2\xa0 So if you have a television set a year old or newer, you\'re prepared; you don\'t need to do anything, you don\'t need to worry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you have a television set more than a year old and you\'re not on cable or satellite, and you\'re relying basically on free over-the-air service, you are not ready.\xc2\xa0 And you will lose your television service this Friday if you don\'t act now.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you have three options:\xc2\xa0 You can subscribe to cable or satellite; you can purchase a newer television set that has these automatic digital tuners built in; or you can purchase a converter box.\xc2\xa0 The Recovery Act provided Commerce with money to help consumers having trouble affording a digital converter box. Millions of households have applied for and received the $40 coupons to cover the cost of these converter boxes.\xc2\xa0 And the converter boxes start at $40 and we mail out two coupons per household, requesting household.\xc2\xa0 So that basically means that with the coupons you get a free converter box.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While coupons are still available for eligible households, it will take some nine days for us to process and send out, first-class mail, these coupons, and so they will not arrive in time for this Friday\'s conversion.\xc2\xa0 We will have these coupons available until the end of July -- July 31st -- or as long as supplies last.\xc2\xa0 The coupons are good for 90 days each.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you already have a coupon, please make sure to purchase the converter box immediately at a partnering retail store like Target, RadioShack, Circuit City, or Wal-Mart.\xc2\xa0 Take it home, hook it up right away -- in fact, you can use these converter boxes now and receive the digital signal now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can get more information about the transition, or apply for a coupon, or even find a nearby retailer selling these converter boxes by calling us toll-free at 1-888-DTV-2009.\xc2\xa0 And for those Americans who need extra assistance, the FCC is offering free in-home installation for consumers in most cities. They can call the FCC, or if you have a technical question about how to install the converter boxes, call the FCC at 1-888-CALL-FCC.\xc2\xa0 They have a robust call center that\'s in operation to help Americans with the transition and the call center will be fully staffed for many days even after June 12th.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For those families already prepared for the transition, make sure to help other friends and families.\xc2\xa0 If they have leftover coupons, unused coupons that are still valid, feel free to share them with other individuals so they can rush out and get a converter box.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will continue to reach out to the most vulnerable communities to ensure as many Americans as possible are ready for this switch to digital television.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that families are able to not only receive their favorite programming, but more importantly, to receive news broadcasts of emergency alerts, impending storms, and any other emergency situation within their community.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very important that communities and people throughout our nation have the information they need to respond in times of emergencies.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I want to thank you now, and I\'d be happy to take any questions you have about the transition or the progress that we\'ve made in decreasing the number of families who are unprepared.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what kind of planning you have in place for the families who, come Friday or Saturday, despite your efforts, will not have gone through this and will lose their service?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 Well, the television stations, even though the screens will go blue, will have telephone numbers on the bottom -- either our telephone number, our toll free number, 1-888-DTV-2009, where they can continue to request the coupons; and also telephone numbers for the FCC.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This will come up -- the TV turns on, this will come on their screen?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 It\'s a rolling conversion starting midnight Thursday night, 12:01 a.m. Friday.\xc2\xa0 Some stations will start converting to digital throughout the day.\xc2\xa0 But by the end of the day all television stations must be exclusively on digital.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have a sense of how many people will be affected, who will not have converted by now?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 Well, as of this last Sunday we had some 2.7 million households -- excuse me, 2.8 million households, roughly 2.5 percent of all households in America with television sets that are not prepared.\xc2\xa0 And when we say "not prepared," we mean who don\'t have at least one television set that can continue to receive news.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I mean, in our own household we have several television sets that are on cable, that are hooked up to cable, but I also have an old television set in the garage that\'s not hooked up and will not be able to receive the broadcast after June 12.\xc2\xa0 But we are prepared because our other television sets have cable and therefore not affected.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re talking about families that are completely unprepared, that have neither the converter box, don\'t have a new television set, or don\'t have cable or satellite.\xc2\xa0 We call them "totally unprepared."\xc2\xa0 And on June 12th, if they don\'t do something between now and then, they will get nothing but a blue screen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there particular pockets of the country where families are unprepared, or are they scattered throughout the country?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 It\'s actually -- we\'re finding that it\'s primarily on the West Coast and the Southwest that are more unprepared than the rest of the country.\xc2\xa0 Los Angeles, while having a small percentage of families unprepared, a small percentage of a huge market is about a quarter-million households that are unprepared.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re also finding that it\'s -- ethnic groups are more unprepared than the general population:\xc2\xa0 African American, Hispanic, almost twice the national average; Asian Americans just slightly above the national average.\xc2\xa0 Surprisingly enough, seniors are prepared.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the younger generation, households of under 30 that are also more unprepared than the national average.\xc2\xa0 Maybe it\'s because they rely on new forms of media for news and programming and don\'t care about television anymore.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None of the newspaper guys are -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 So you new media people, you must be loving it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t watch the news tonight.</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 The Recovery Act provided $650 million.\xc2\xa0 And we have more than enough coupons to handle all the unprepared households if they were to ask for coupons.\xc2\xa0 We also have several million coupons that have not yet been redeemed, but we\'ve also provided funds to the FCC for outreach call center support.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But we\'ve really been pleased with the amazing interest and activity in just the last week.\xc2\xa0 The last few days we\'ve been receiving requests from over 100,000 households asking for coupons.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re seeing a dramatic drop in the number of unprepared families.</div> <div class="legacy-para">When the President took office, there were some -- almost 6 million households, 6.8 -- excuse me, almost 7 million households not prepared -- 6.8 million, to be exact.\xc2\xa0 That\'s roughly 5.9 percent of the households not prepared.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s now down to 2.5 percent, or 2.8 million households.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had said that this -- there was an ethnicity -- Hispanics and African Americans.\xc2\xa0 Is this a language -- so is this a language issue that -- has there been enough done on the language front?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 Well, it could be a language issue.\xc2\xa0 Ethnic minorities, for whatever reason -- it may be due to language -- are not as prepared as others.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve been reaching out using Hispanic -- Telemundo, Univision; held a press conference with Mayor Villaraigosa in Los Angeles, Mayor Kevin Johnson in Sacramento.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since those press conferences and those special events\xc2\xa0 -- I\'ve conducted more than 50 events -- interviews, on-air radio shows, television shows, working with the print media -- the activity in request for coupons have really spiked.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re using a lot of free media as well as paid media.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank all the partners in the television industry and broadcasting industry for getting the word out.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it possible that some just decided not to do it, and isn\'t that okay?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 That\'s true.\xc2\xa0 As long as -- we believe that there\'s almost universal understanding of it.\xc2\xa0 We know that there will be some people who don\'t want to make the conversion or maybe they\'ll wait until they get a new television set, or maybe will just -- don\'t want it for now.\xc2\xa0 And we do know that there are a lot of people who procrastinate, whether it\'s paying taxes or, when we were in college, studying for exams -- or not -- (laughter) -- and getting by.\xc2\xa0 But, again, just in the last few days more than 100,000 households have been calling asking for coupons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, can you explain how you\'re getting these statistics?\xc2\xa0 Like how do we know that 2.5 percent of TV households don\'t have it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 It\'s from Nielsen data and they collect the data almost every week or every other week.\xc2\xa0 And the data that I\'ve given you is the data as of Sunday, this past Sunday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about people who are prepared, hook up the converter box, but still don\'t get a picture?\xc2\xa0 How many of those might there be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 It could be a problem of reception because for digital it\'s all or nothing.\xc2\xa0 Using the old analog signals, if you had a building that was blocking the airwaves you might get ghosting, and if you were pretty far from the transmission tower the signal might be weak and you might not have a very good picture, it might be very grainy.\xc2\xa0 With digital it\'s all or nothing.\xc2\xa0 So there may be some problems and households may need to buy a little antenna that they could attach to a converter box as well.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But if people are having some questions they should call the FCC, and it\'s toll free at 1-888-CALL-FCC.\xc2\xa0 And if people are having some problems with installation understanding, the FCC has free in-home consultation and installation service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I ask on a different subject, the WTO?\xc2\xa0 The Russians and their two neighbors, Kazakhstan and Belarus, have indicated that they now want to join the WTO as a union other than individual nations.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard about that?\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything to say about that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">SECRETARY LOCKE:\xc2\xa0 No, I had not heard that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I had not heard that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">All right, thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me make a couple of other short announcements before we get going.\xc2\xa0 Earlier today the President called President Sleiman to congratulate him on Lebanon\'s successful parliamentary elections; commended Lebanon\'s interior ministry and security services for their hard work.\xc2\xa0 President Obama reiterated his strong commitment to Lebanon\'s sovereignty and independence, and indicated that he looked forward to working with the President to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Lebanon.\xc2\xa0 Finally, President Obama noted that his Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, George Mitchell, would be in Lebanon on Friday and looked forward to meeting with the President.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Secondly, the President will travel on Monday, to Chicago, to address the annual meeting of the American Medical Association.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll start with the recognition that the health care system status quo is unsustainable and he\'ll outline the case for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll make clear why we can\'t afford to wait another year or another administration to bring down costs that are crushing families, businesses, and government.</div> <div class="legacy-para">In the speech the President will discuss the reasons why past efforts have failed and he\'ll address the consequences of failing to act again this year.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll lay out plainly what health care reform will mean for American families and their doctors and what it won\'t.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President will also address the importance of making sure that reform doesn\'t add to our deficit, and what we can do to strengthen what works in our health care system and to fix what\'s broken so that we can build -- what we build provides the best care in the world at the lowest cost.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then, finally, I would add, not too long before coming out here, probably about 1:55 p.m. or so, I had an opportunity to speak with the President about the shooting at the Holocaust Museum today, informed him of the situation, gave him the details that we had been given via that Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 He asked about the condition of the security guard.\xc2\xa0 So he is aware of the incident this afternoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, Mr. Feller.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics, Robert, thank you.\xc2\xa0 First of all, following up on that, did the President have any other reaction?\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- I walked in and told him there had been a shooting at the museum -- obviously, concerned and concerned for the security guard that appears to have been hurt.\xc2\xa0 I gave him, Ben, mostly a factual briefing of the facts as we knew it, or knew them at that point, and that\'s about it; obviously, saddened by what has happened.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- can you just give us a little bit more detail about the White House involvement in a tragedy like this?\xc2\xa0 How does coordination work?\xc2\xa0 Is it through the Homeland Security Council?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we get regular updates through the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 We\'re in contact with and get updates from the Homeland Security Council and other agencies like the FBI.\xc2\xa0 So I assume throughout the day we\'ll continue to get information about -- facts and what\'s happened at the museum.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also want to ask you a couple of quick things on health care.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a progress report on the President\'s meeting today with the senators?\xc2\xa0 How does the White House think it went?\xc2\xa0 Was anything accomplished today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President continued to discuss with important and leading members of Congress on health care reform the challenges that we have before us.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he\'ll travel tomorrow to Green Bay and have a town hall meeting on this.\xc2\xa0 We just announced, obviously, the speech in Chicago on Monday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is pleased that what appears to be happening is making progress.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll hear him both tomorrow and Monday, as I said, lay out the strong case for health care reform to bring about some relief for families and small business from the cost that they\'re seeing rise each and every year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Baucus said afterwards here on the driveway that everything remained an option.\xc2\xa0 He said "We are all flexible on all these points -- we are, the President is."\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate statement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is anxious to let the legislative process work.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve all had a chance to cover the letter that he sent last week regarding the principles that he has for meaningful health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to work that process to ensure that progress is on the right path.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of financial questions.\xc2\xa0 First, how confident is the administration that GM\'s bankruptcy restructuring will proceed smoothly now that the Supreme Court decided not to intervene with Chrysler and the sale to Fiat has gone through?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it gives everybody confidence.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we had great confidence in the restructuring plan that had been put together as part of the deal that\'s now been finalized with Chrysler and Fiat.\xc2\xa0 It gives Chrysler a restructured opportunity to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s our strong hope that the same happens relatively quickly for GM.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the time frame is slightly longer.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve discussed a 60- to 90-day period rather than a 30- to 60-day period for Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, GM is a little bit bigger company.\xc2\xa0 But we have confidence that the process that\'s been put forward will work its way through the system.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We understand, as I said yesterday, that people are entitled to their day in court if they have grievances about some situations surrounding the bankruptcy.\xc2\xa0 But the President and the Auto Task Force strongly believe this gives car companies, communities, workers, and investors the best opportunity -- and taxpayers -- the best opportunity moving forward.\xc2\xa0 It\'s what\'s kept plants open; it\'s what\'s kept people on the job.\xc2\xa0 And I think we are heartened by what happened at the Supreme Court and hope to see the same follow for General Motors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on executive compensation, will the administration be naming Kenneth Feinberg as the pay czar to oversee the packages -- pay packages for executives and companies that are receiving bailout money?\xc2\xa0 And how much of the decision on these measures was driven by the President\'s desire to quell public anger about compensation news that has come out recently?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Ken Feinberg is going to assume the role of special master that will allow him to review for soundness, appropriateness, and to limit risk relating to compensation packages for those companies that are either receiving extraordinary assistance or might in the future.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think obviously this is an individual that has great experience in mediation in things that are -- these type of things that are important.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- obviously this is a topic that the President has spoken about.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the factsheets have all gone out from Treasury yet, but there\'s additional legislative efforts that we will undertake, as you heard the President talk about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 The shooting today at the Holocaust Museum, combined with the shooting of Dr. Tiller, as well as the shooting of the military recruiter in Little Rock -- is the White House at all concerned that there is some sort of trend of political violence or domestic terrorism going on?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I would want to ask somebody in law enforcement if they see links such as that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it would be wise for me to surmise something like that.\xc2\xa0 I think, as the President said in a statement after the shooting of Dr. Tiller, that regardless of disagreeing or disparate viewpoints obviously in our society, this is not in any way the type of action that anybody wants to see in settling even the most vehement disputes.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s hard for me to surmise without having a more in-depth conversation with law enforcement.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is really just out of curiosity more than anything -- how do you guys decide which acts of violence prompt a White House response and which ones won\'t?\xc2\xa0 There was a statement that went out about Dr. Tiller.\xc2\xa0 How was the decision made that that would get a presidential statement whereas the military recruiter in Arkansas shooting would not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe a statement did go to many stations in Arkansas regarding that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, it did?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And just about executive compensation, what\'s the response of the White House to the pushback from business groups that the federal government should have no role in deciding how their executive compensation is delivered; whether it\'s a nonbinding resolution or not, it\'s not the job of the government to tell them how to run their companies?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously this is split up into at least three different baskets, I\'d say.\xc2\xa0 You have the congressional amendment -- the Dodd amendment -- that passed covering for the top five corporate officers and the next highest 20 paid employees for all companies receiving some measure of TARP assistance that governs limits on bonuses.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one.\xc2\xa0 That was congressional intent.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think you\'ll see from the fact sheets that will soon go out -- my apologies that they haven\'t -- there\'s a bit of an expansion from what is in the congressionally mandated amendment that gives for the seven current companies receiving extraordinary assistance the ability to not simply look at the top five plus 20, but indeed the top 100, in order to judge, as I said, the soundness, the appropriateness, and whether or not the risk is being taken into account in this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the President has supported as a member of the Senate and continues to support efforts that are nonbinding shareholder efforts to provide -- so that shareholders are empowered to provide some say on the compensation for the managers for the companies for which they invest.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s nonbinding, but we have seen in certainly other countries that have had arrangements like this that the power of public opinion is persuasive in ensuring that compensation doesn\'t become so aligned with short-term gain, rather than long-term incentive, which is why most people own stock in a company.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that there are steps that we can take to ensure that there are mechanisms in place, again, that bolster this notion of long-term incentive rather than short-term gain, so that that doesn\'t contribute to something like we\'ve seen in this economic crisis.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forgoing the TARP, just on the publicly traded companies, you didn\'t mention the push that Secretary Geithner mentioned today to have the compensation boards be more independent.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s another legislative thing that allows -- like in Sarbanes-Oxley, with the independence of the accounting committees, this provides the independence for the compensation committee not to be connected with management -- again, in order to set compensation that is outside of what we believe rewards that long-term incentive.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes, rightly, that these two legislative efforts, in addition to the regulations surrounding the congressional -- around the Dodd amendment, as well as what Mr. Feinberg is going to do, are common-sense reforms that will give people confidence in publicly traded companies.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on that, what\'s Feinberg\'s jurisdiction going to be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Feinberg\'s jurisdiction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is -- these are for, again, for companies that are receiving what\'s termed exceptional assistance.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At this point -- right -- at this point, those are seven -- it\'s AIG, Citi, Bank of America, GM, GMAC, Chrysler, and Chrysler Financial.\xc2\xa0 Those are the ones that are, at this point, determined to have outstanding exceptional assistance through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\xc2\xa0 Obviously going forward, were somebody to fall into that category, they, too, would come into that jurisdiction.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s just jurisdiction and that\'s --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, some financial institutions seem to be rushing to want to pay back some of the bailout money, which, on the one hand, that\'s good because it shows they\'re in a good financial position; but on the other hand, it seems that they want to get out from under the thumb of the government, the oversight, some of the restrictions.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration troubled at all by that, that the oversight that has been put in place to protect consumers, they want to get out from under that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as the President has said numerous times, he doesn\'t want to run car companies, he doesn\'t want to run banks, he doesn\'t want to run insurance companies with hedge funds on top of them.\xc2\xa0 There is, obviously, a robust free enterprise system that is going to determine with reasonable regulation the rules of the road.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So if banks, based on the recommendations and approval of their regulators, are deemed able to have the capital cushion that\'s required that allows them to pay back that TARP money, we obviously believe -- again, assuming the regulators obviously approve that -- that that\'s a healthy thing for our system.\xc2\xa0 It gives confidence that the program was run in a way that provided temporary assistance through extraordinarily bad times.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The government, as per the announcement yesterday, recouped not just $66 billion in money that was lent, but $2 billion that was paid in interest.\xc2\xa0 We\'re happy to get out of the business of being any sort of creditor.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\'s the thinking, though, when you hear that they want to get from under the restrictions or that oversight, when it comes to how much they can --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what the President believes is -- and I think it\'s why it\'s extremely important the President\'s effort through legislation, to gain a say on pay, which allows again a non-binding vote of shareholders to judge the compensation levels for the management structure for the company in which they\'ve invested their hard-earned money.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve seen in other countries, despite the fact that it\'s non-binding, obviously there\'s a tremendous power of public opinion and we\'ve seen that that can bring about tremendous reforms.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President continues to believe, as I\'ve said earlier to Jake\'s question, that nobody finds fault with people that are doing well and are being paid well, as long as that compensation appears to be aligned with the long-term incentive for growth in a company rather than for the short-term gain of an individual, which happens to generally be, -- or can be at the expense of stockholders.\xc2\xa0 These are I think practical, common-sense safeguards that the President advocates, and in these regulations, has put in place that I think give people a lot of confidence.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell a little bit -- give us a little more information on how Ken Feinberg will actually do this, what kind of power he has?\xc2\xa0 Does he just set salary and bonus figures and say, here it is?\xc2\xa0 Or do they propose a package that he then denies or approves?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is a -- he has the jurisdiction to review, for those companies receiving that exceptional assistance -- the seven companies I outlined and anything if it were to be added in the future -- he has the ability to review the compensation structures and determine whether or not we believe they met the criteria of being sound and appropriate, rather than excessive.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can he -- if he disapproves of one, can he then set his own figures?\xc2\xa0 Or do they just keep coming back --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He can set his own figures.\xc2\xa0 People can -- he will be able to ensure, for those companies receiving exceptional assistance, for those top 100 paid employees, a compensation structure that he believes and the government believes is sound and appropriate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for how long will these companies be under this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For as long as they have that exceptional assistance.\xc2\xa0 So, as Dan said, if "Chip Reid Bank" is receiving exceptional assistance, you work with your appropriate regulator, whether it\'s the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, come to a conclusion that the money that you\'ve been given you can pay back -- if that money is paid back then obviously you\'re not a recipient anymore of exceptional assistance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The Dodd amendment for the top five corporate officers and the next-highest-20 paid employees extends for all businesses, all companies that are receiving any TARP assistance.\xc2\xa0 And what that law, as you know, does -- doesn\'t cap pay, but allows only someone to receive as a bonus one-third of what they\'re paid.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So isn\'t this a pretty extraordinary departure from the way American capitalism has -- I know these are extraordinary circumstances, but, still, to have a government employee setting the salaries for hundreds of private-sector employees --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chip, these are private-sector employees that, in many ways, have their job based on the extraordinary assistance that has been provided by taxpayers to ensure that they can continue to have their job.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- all companies have taxpayer assistance in one way or another.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, there are all different forms of so-called corporate welfare all through the tax code.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- I\'m not entirely sure what you\'re getting at, but --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m getting at if any company that gets any kind of government assistance can have their salary set by the federal government, where does that stop?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, that was the appropriate question if what I had outlined met that criteria.\xc2\xa0 Again, I denoted there are seven companies that have received extraordinary taxpayer assistance, anywhere from -- I don\'t know the rankings of how much they\'ve made, but obviously these seven companies have received extraordinary assistance.\xc2\xa0 Congress passed the Dodd amendment that relates to any company that receives funding or money directly through the TARP program.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But again, this is not an effort to set the salaries, as you said, to the penny of every publicly owned or traded company in this country.\xc2\xa0 This is a proposal that protects the taxpayer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there are many in the business community who think once you\'ve set this precedent, where does it stop?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, you guys have asked me any number of times about the role that the government has to play in the event that it\'s providing, as I\'ve said, the exceptional or extraordinary assistance that has been provided by the taxpayers. The President believes and Congress believed that that was something that was important to do to protect the taxpayers, to ensure that compensation, either through salary or bonuses, was done in a way that was consistent with sound and appropriate practices and that limited risk for taxpayers.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think that\'s what\'s important here, is that these are investments that have been made through the TARP program by taxpayers through taxpayer money.\xc2\xa0 This is an effort both congressionally mandated and through the Treasury Department to ensure that that investment is protected in order not to rationalize an irrationally risky compensation package.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just in the array of questions, there have been questions about government involvement in the auto industry, what Chip is getting at about compensation, and now you\'ve got the President tackling health care.\xc2\xa0 There\'s concerns among some of the public -- obviously Republican criticism.\xc2\xa0 At what point -- how do you reassure the public that says, I don\'t know if the government is reaching in too much to too many things and, you know, maybe health care is one step too much?\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to that criticism of government\'s involvement in so many things right now, whether it\'s the auto industry, financial industry, now in redoing health care?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously -- I don\'t know if you\'ve asked a question this week about the budget deficit, but Medicare and Medicaid, as Peter said, take up a big chunk of our federal budget.\xc2\xa0 Those costs are simply going to grow, if not dealt with, exponentially over the next few decades.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President believes that health care reform will help on a path toward fiscal responsibility, and that millions of Americans, families and small businesses are looking for relief from the crushing costs of health care that, again, rise several times the rate of inflation each year.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think on any number of occasions, Chuck, the President wishes that any number of problems might not be on his plate, but that\'s not necessarily the set of cards that\'s been dealt to him.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, let me ask it in another way, then.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried that the political problem, you know, that Republicans are using as angles, saying, well, government is trying to get too involved in that -- that could hurt the President\'s chances, for instance, of getting a government plan, a public plan in his health care because there is this sort of rising discomfort among the populous about government involvement in everything?\xc2\xa0 You know, the government\'s involvement in the auto industry --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you listen to the debate on Capitol Hill about health care you\'re likely to hear two very important words:\xc2\xa0 choice and competition.\xc2\xa0 A public option that you\'re referring to is nothing more than the ability to provide more choice through competition.\xc2\xa0 Those I think are values that you\'ll hear throughout this debate as being held near and dear to the hearts of not just people on Capitol Hill, but throughout the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President and Congress are working to design health care reform that provides more choice and more competition.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an issue that you guys are ready to say, you know what, we can\'t wait for government, we want less government involvement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We don\'t want to own a TV company.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yet.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll talk about your -- yes, sir, I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s Ken Feinberg being compensated?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 You should get a series of factsheets at some point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two are out; there\'s one more to come.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, when the President unveiled his own compensation proposals, there was a lot of fanfare, it was before the Dodd legislation passed.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize this -- the new rules in relation to his original proposal?\xc2\xa0 Is he walking back from his original proposal?\xc2\xa0 Was it trumped by legislation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, obviously Congress passing the Dodd amendment does require, obviously -- as you mentioned with wanting to see the regulations -- is the law of the land for compensation relating to anybody receiving TARP funds.\xc2\xa0 The President outlined a set of proposals that in many ways, because of the law of the land, were superseded.\xc2\xa0 We believe that what Mr. Feinberg will do broadens the scope of what can be looked into because of just the simple number of employees that are affected in companies receiving that exceptional or extraordinary assistance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously if there -- if a proposal comes to his desk that is equal to the number that we talked about earlier, that\'s something that will obviously -- is a safe-harbor part of this provision.\xc2\xa0 But we believe that Mr. Feinberg\'s role gives him the ability to better understand and better look into the soundness, the appropriateness, and ensuring that balance of risk.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why stop short of giving shareholders binding say on executive pay?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip thought it was a bad idea.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ha ha.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, exactly.\xc2\xa0 No, I think that the President believes that the appropriateness of giving shareholders the power of public opinion is an appropriate role. I think the President believes that -- the President does not want to, just as he doesn\'t want to own a bank or a car company, doesn\'t want to be the person that sets pay at every single entity for every single business in this country.\xc2\xa0 I think this provides the nonbinding ability for public opinion through greater transparency and empowering of stockholders who have a vested interest in the health and well-being of the company to have their say on managerial pay and compensation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of say is it if it\'s not binding?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is this the opposite of the question you asked the first time?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We will -- if you look at -- for instance, this was done in Great Britain.\xc2\xa0 There was a non-binding say on pay that was instituted that gave, as I\'ve said, greater transparency and empowered those that owned the company to have a say.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s worked because public opinion is very powerful.\xc2\xa0 If a compensation package is not approved by the stockholders that own that corporation, there\'s a tremendous amount of public pressure that has resulted in instituting common sense pay reforms.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you hinted at it, but can you say explicitly that you are -- the administration is dropping plans to limit salaries at companies receiving bailout funds?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Receiving what type of bailout funds?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The TARP money.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as Jonathan asked, the original proposal that the President had limiting at a certain amount exceptional assistance was, and has been, superseded by implementing regulations relating to the law of the land.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re dropping it because of the Dodd amendment?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because, again, we believe actually that we\'ve got probably a stronger proposal in terms of having somebody look into a greater number of the people that are involved.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because at the time the administration did say that the two proposals would work hand in hand.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there has been a lot of time and energy spent on working through regulations to implement the law of the land.\xc2\xa0 We believe we\'ve struck the right balance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could ask a question on another executive pay question, the issue of independent directors.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration propose a tightening, a changing of the definition of what it means to be an independent member of a compensation committee?\xc2\xa0 Because most companies already are required to adhere by that rule.\xc2\xa0 So it looks to the people --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me have you look at the fact sheet -- I don\'t know if that\'s the one that\'s not out -- take a look at that and then let\'s talk and see if you have questions beyond that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, something completely different.\xc2\xa0 Mike Rogers is a member of Congress, Republican from Michigan, has come back from Afghanistan and he tells our network that while he was there he witnessed U.S. military personnel reading Miranda rights to high-value detainees at Bagram detention facility in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He said this -- was informed by the military there that this is a common practice now to, upon their capture of these high-value targets, read them the Miranda rights.\xc2\xa0 And he considers this a significant policy change, one that suggests to him, at least, that the administration has changed the orientation in Afghanistan from war fighting to law enforcement with this use of Miranda rights read to detainees.\xc2\xa0 Would you care to comment on any of those observations?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'d need a little bit more information.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if that\'s true or untrue, that the Miranda rights are read?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no reason to disbelieve a member of Congress, but I don\'t know any of the circumstances that are involved around it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it come as a surprise to the White House that that\'s what would be happening?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a surprise to me, but again, I think I\'d need a little bit more information to begin to surmise some of what the Congressman has -- I don\'t know if he spoke with commanders on the ground, I don\'t know if he saw General McChrystal or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In general does the White House think that\'s a good idea?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, let me get a little bit -- I\'m happy to look at whatever longer-form information and get someone at NSC also to look at it.\xc2\xa0 I hate to speculate on four sentences off of a report.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just so I understand what you\'re saying, when you said it wouldn\'t come as a surprise to you, what did you mean by that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not surprised by a lot in this town anymore.\xc2\xa0 Let me look at what you\'re talking about --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not contesting that that\'s a policy that\'s being used?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to make sure I understand what you\'re saying.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I feel like you should be reading me my rights.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\'m hoping to get my lawyer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I\'m happy to look at whatever you have and try to give you an informed opinion based on somebody who\'s got greater jurisdiction over detainees at Bagram.\xc2\xa0 That\'s outside of my portfolio.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Judge Sotomayor, Republicans have begun to complain about what they consider to be omissions from the questionnaire, gaps in it, information that they think is relevant to the confirmation process, particularly as they say, from their point of view, it\'s somewhat more accelerated than they would prefer.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House satisfied that the questionnaire is as complete as it needs to be, number one, and as complete as it\'s ever going to be?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as is the case with many Supreme Court nominees, additional information based on questions that they have or going back into the record quite some time -- for instance, whether it\'s her work as a district attorney, obviously that was a number of years ago -- those files have to be pulled.\xc2\xa0 And anything that is lacked in the questionnaire will be provided in a timely manner to the committee.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The questionnaire --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that process underway, are you aware?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, this is similar to, I think, in the case of John Roberts there were thousands of pages that were in archives that ultimately had to be delivered after the original questionnaire was sent to Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 So that obviously is something that seems to be fairly usual.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you say "timely basis," what do you mean?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As soon as the information comes from wherever files are being held, for instance, in her work as a district attorney, or other information that\'s being gathered on her.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one quick on one health care.\xc2\xa0 You said, flexibility on everything.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the President is --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Ben said that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, Max Baucus said that and you agreed --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We promoted Ben to chairman of the Finance Committee just a minute ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said that that was something that is a fair representation of what the President said and what the senator said.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to make sure that that also means the President is therefore flexible on the question of taxing benefits?\xc2\xa0 Because Max Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said yesterday that he considers that not only a live option, but a very good option to provide financing that the White House has conceded may not exist currently.\xc2\xa0 And so after having said that on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yesterday -- which is a new development since the issue has been raised in this briefing room.\xc2\xa0 Okay, that\'s a new fact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, actually, I think he also said that a week ago and I got asked about it then, right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your memory may be better than mine on this one.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you give me that information, I\'ll look at it and we can trade --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what is he inflexible on?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is he inflexible on?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, he ran for the Presidency a few years ago, and is not a member of any of the relevant committees; and he\'s not a legislator and he\'s not a senator.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that -- he, you saw, wrote a letter based on the principles that he\'d like to see as part of health care reform, and he\'s going to watch what happens on Capitol Hill.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Senator Baucus said the President was flexible when I asked him specifically about this question.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to make sure if Senator Baucus is properly interpreting the President\'s position on this issue -- heavily debated in the campaign you just referenced.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And heavily answered in the preceding weeks from this very room and this very podium.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to watch what happens on Capitol Hill and will have more to say as it gets closer to us.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two questions, one on Ken Feinberg.\xc2\xa0 I think that he\'s maybe the 20th czar-type position you\'ve named.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the title is "special master."</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, special master.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of naming these people, bringing them in from the outside to do these jobs, I think you have more than any other administration.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering why --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know have any special masters.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, whatever you\'re calling them.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious, why not use somebody who\'s already in the administration?\xc2\xa0 Why bring people in from the outside to do this?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously this is -- the seven companies that we\'re talking about, a hundred employees for each of these seven companies is obviously something that\'s going to take a great deal of time and somebody -- something that we think is better focused on by the use of a special master.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just another question about the public plan.\xc2\xa0 As you said, the President is very flexible on all the details of health care, but he has been specific about this one.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he wrote the letter to Congress saying he wants a public plan to be in there.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how that plan is structured, which is the subject of a lot of debate on the Hill -- how robust it is, whether there\'s a trigger, is it owned by the government or is it a co-op -- is he open to all possible forms of this public plan or does he have a preference?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, on this and other questions, though I appreciate the opportunity to comment on every single juncture of the legislative process --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are pretty big, important junctures.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They seem to be each day I get asked.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to let the process work its way through and get a sense of where we\'re going.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Organizing for America, an arm of the DNC, which I would imagine is sympathetic to the overall agenda of this White House, and the White House is encouraging of its grassroots effort, is making a very strong public push for a public option in this plan, saying it is consistent with the President\'s approach.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t the public have a right to know what the President\'s general approach is?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And I answered earlier that we -- that\'s why the President put it in his letter and that\'s why the President believes increasing choice through competition is important.\xc2\xa0 Now, in terms of the design for exchanges and co-ops, I\'m just not going to get into doing that each and every day of the week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\'t ask about those?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of the detail every day on this massive reform --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not the special master on press questions; you guys can ask what you want.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Robert, when Congress sets a schedule as --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You seem to be here each and every day doing it, so yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait.\xc2\xa0 When Congress sets a schedule of having bills off the floor by the end of July, that gives the public a very limited time to evaluate all the policy implications of what the health care legislation is going to mean in their lives, because every lawmaker said it\'s going to affect a hundred percent of America.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t the White House at some point have an obligation to tell the public exactly what it believes should be in the bill that\'s going to change their lives?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the multitude of times in which the President has talked about this:\xc2\xa0 the campaign, the letter that was sent out last week, the fact that there\'s a town hall meeting tomorrow that I would look forward to your network, for the basis by which a hundred percent of Americans that watch FOX News will be able to share with the President and those attending the meeting their feelings on health care reform.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll do this -- I\'ll watch your network tomorrow to see what percentage of that meeting is shared with a hundred percent of the public that you just appropriately asked me about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you let me know how specific he\'s going to be, maybe we\'ll take more.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the basis of your question seemed to be that all public information was good and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I couldn\'t agree more.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can hardly wait -- you can watch it in my office, we\'ll watch FOX and see how much they cover tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I think I just set the bar kind of high.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to look ahead to the speech on Monday.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked to the American people saying if you like the health care you have, you get to keep it under my plan.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\'t heard him talk that much particularly to doctors, which he\'s going to do on Monday.\xc2\xa0 Doctors are obviously concerned that their reimbursements will be cut.\xc2\xa0 They\'re worried and have worried for a long time about lawsuits and the rising cost of malpractice insurance.\xc2\xa0 So what is his message to doctors, what will we be hearing from him?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, whether or not there are specifics about hospital reimbursements or malpractice that you talked about, I know that\'s something that has been talked about in here and talked about in some of the meetings with legislators.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, health care professionals writ large and doctors obviously are as integral as anybody in the delivery of health care and in the practice of health care.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously the President will -- has talked about and will talk about in the speech not just his case for reform -- and you\'ve heard Peter also talk about this just this week -- how we improve the way health care is delivered, the steps that have been taken as part of the Recovery Act to make those steps easier and more cost-efficient.\xc2\xa0 I think all of that are things that you\'ll hear both tomorrow and Monday -- on FOX.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But no word on if we\'ll hear explicitly on reimbursements or liability --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the draft to see if those specific topics will be covered on Monday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Holocaust incident, the President just five days ago was in Germany at a very dramatic site.\xc2\xa0 Did he say at all to you or is he thinking at all that that visit could get people thinking about the Holocaust and issues, that there was some kind of perhaps backlash of this person at the Holocaust Museum?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me separate the two, because I think that\'s -- I mean, obviously I think it was for both the President and all of those that were there an extraordinarily powerful stop and reminder of the horrors that we saw not too long ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But without, again, having a conversation with law enforcement about circumstances for why what happened today -- I would hate to, at this point based on what I know, connect anything.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a candidate in Iran\'s elections that the White House sees as most conducive to the President\'s engagement strategy?\xc2\xa0 And how is the White House interpreting this outburst of campaigning and enthusiasm towards the elections?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into candidates.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President, as he talked about in Cairo, believes that free and fair elections and the robust task of democracy in picking a government for yourself is tremendously important as -- just as I said and he said, it\'s not just that, it\'s also how that government reacts.\xc2\xa0 Obviously as I\'ve said here, the President was heartened by the increase in activity and turnout relating to the elections in Lebanon and we\'ll certainly wait and see what happens this coming week.</div> <div class="legacy-para">David.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have anything to say about the closing of the clinic that was run by George Tiller?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him, so I don\'t know if he has a opinion on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Second question, the other night Newt Gingrich said that the elite media has to prop up Joe Biden and pretend he actually knows what he\'s doing.\xc2\xa0 Any comment on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Should I speak on behalf of the elite media or the -- look, the Vice President is among the most trusted advisors that the President has.\xc2\xa0 The role he plays is important and very significant, from his efforts to implement the recovery plan through our efforts on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re lucky and grateful to have him, as I think the country is, for his continued service.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Savannah.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things on the Holocaust shooting.\xc2\xa0 When you briefed the President did you have any information about the background of the suspect and were you able to convey that at that point?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, all I -- this was I think around 1:55 p.m., almost 2:00 p.m.\xc2\xa0 All I had was the detail of somebody had gone in with a gun, shot at a security guard, the security guard shot at the individual that came in.\xc2\xa0 On the way out I learned that -- I think the individual is 89 or 90 years old.\xc2\xa0 But at that point that\'s all the background -- I didn\'t have the age even when I went and talked to the President and see if he\'s gotten -- I assume he\'s gotten additional updates with all the time we\'ve been out here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Cross-talk.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If there is stuff that the President relays, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That age you just -- 89 or 90, was that -- who was that age?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I had seen on the way out, was the age of the gunman that entered the museum.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You saw that on TV, not at -- you didn\'t get that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I saw that on TV.\xc2\xa0 I have not seen -- I have not gotten on e-mail or BlackBerry additional updates while we\'ve been in here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have indications in that briefing that this was a hate crime?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, at that point I just was relaying a series of facts.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on GM actually.\xc2\xa0 Ed Whitacre, the new chair of GM, told Bloomberg, "I don\'t know anything about cars.\xc2\xa0 A business is a business and I think I can learn about cars.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not that old and I think the business principles are the same."\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is, what would you say to anyone who might be alarmed that the new GM chair doesn\'t know about cars?\xc2\xa0 But secondly, I mean, is it possibly -- do you look at that as a virtue because he\'s --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the one company that we haven\'t talked about in receiving assistance or asked for assistance from the government is Ford.\xc2\xa0 Alan Mulally came from Boeing.\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion that one has to come from the car industry in order to change the management mind set or to make tough decisions in restructuring a company -- I think what the task force looked for and I think what the American people can be confident in is that we looked for and found somebody that exhibits that toughness, that has experience running a company of the size that GM is, and I think the praise for Mr. Whitacre has been universal since we\'ve talked about -- or since his name was announced yesterday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think if you look at the experiences of the companies that we\'ve talked about in here because they are receiving funds, the company that we didn\'t talk about -- I think prior experience in the car industry was not required.\xc2\xa0 What was required was somebody with savvy, big business experience that could take a company, change its management culture, make some of those tough decisions to put it on that path toward viability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 3:20 P.M.
