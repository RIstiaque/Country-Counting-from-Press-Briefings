Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:51 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0Let me do a couple of --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He says, happy Monday. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Something we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me do two things at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions. \xc2\xa0The first is, as you heard the President on Friday, he will be attending the climate talks in Paris to meet with world leaders about a global agreement to address this serious issue. \xc2\xa0The President will be attending on Monday, November 30th and Tuesday, December 1st. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Paris, the United States will be pushing for an agreement that does three things. \xc2\xa0The first is that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an agreement that reflects the ambitious climate targets from all of the countries who are participating. \xc2\xa0Second, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an agreement that puts in place a long-term framework that incentivizes countries to ratchet down their emissions over time in a transparent manner, with high standards of accountability, and with the goal of achieving a low-carbon transformation by the end of the century. \xc2\xa0And third, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an agreement that mobilizes ongoing financial and technical support for low-carbon development and climate adaptation, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. \xc2\xa0We know that some of the poorest countries are the ones who are most vulnerable to the most tangible climate impacts that are already being felt around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tScientists and experts firmly agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re already feeling the effects of climate change both here in the United States and around the globe. \xc2\xa0And without action, these impacts pose a clear threat to our economic and national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll note that -- to help explain why the President is committed to acting on climate change and what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake both for the Paris talks and beyond, the President earlier today released a video on his brand-new Facebook page. \xc2\xa0And if you haven\'t taken a look at it, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you check it out.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing, we had elections over the weekend in Burma, and I just wanted to do a quick statement on that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States congratulates the people of Burma on the election, and commend all of the people and institutions in the country who work together to hold a peaceful and historic election. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing initial reports of results, but we encourage everyone to wait for the Union Election Commission\xe2\x80\x99s official results, and the final reports from domestic and international observer missions before making assessments. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is clear is that, for the first time ever, millions of people in Burma voted in a meaningful, competitive election. \xc2\xa0And despite some structural and systemic flaws, we believe that Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s vote represents an important step in Burma\xe2\x80\x99s democratic reform process. \xc2\xa0The U.S. Embassy team was impressed by the enthusiasm of the people of Burma, which was indicated by the long lines, apparent high-voter turnout, and a diversity of voices coming to the polls. \xc2\xa0Young people, women, and members of ethnic groups were all represented, and they were keen to have their voices heard.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re also encouraged by public statements from President Thein Sein and the Commander-in-Chief, saying they would accept the results, as well Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy\xe2\x80\x99s remarks encouraging calm and acceptance of the results. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s important for all political leaders who work together to form a new government, and for stakeholders to help to ensure calm and pursue national reconciliation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that out of the way, Josh, we can go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just stay right there for a moment. \xc2\xa0The early results in this election seem to be showing a pretty overwhelming victory, if things continue to go the way they are, for Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s party. \xc2\xa0The President has obviously invested a lot in Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s emergence from military rule. \xc2\xa0She can\xe2\x80\x99t become the President, but she\xe2\x80\x99s basically said if her party wins an overwhelming victory, she will act as the leader of the country anyway. \xc2\xa0Given the emphasis that the U.S. has placed on a vigorous democratic process in Myanmar, do you see it possible for her to have a role as the country\xe2\x80\x99s leader, even if she\xe2\x80\x99s not actually elected under their constitution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple things about that, Josh. \xc2\xa0I think most directly I would say that it\xe2\x80\x99s already clear that Aung San Suu Kyi has had a powerful voice in bringing about some much-needed reform and change to the political system inside of Burma. \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, what set of official responsibilities she has will be the responsibility of the Burmese people and the Burmese government to determine.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that there were some flaws in the political system there, and I would include in that category that law that specifically targets her, by suggesting that because she has a -- I believe the law is that because she has a spouse that lives in another country that she cannot serve as President. \xc2\xa0So this is an indication that additional reforms are needed and additional work needs to be done to bring about the kind of effective democracy -- \xc2\xa0representative democracy we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see. \xc2\xa0Another one of those rules is that, right now, 25 percent of the parliamentary seats are guaranteed to the military.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are some imperfections, to put it mildly. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying the rather dramatic change that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen inside of Burma. \xc2\xa0And the United States has played an important role in trying to nurture that change and give the Burmese people more of a voice in the governing of their country. And the Burmese people can continue to count on the United States being a partner and strongly supporting their efforts to realize the kind of government that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to have for their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Returning to the attack in Jordan that the President referenced this morning, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some various reporting and different details emerging from that, possibly up to six or more that have passed away as a result of that. \xc2\xa0Do you have any update -- I know the President said two or three -- of exactly what fatalities and circumstances were?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, the latest update that I have is that there were two U.S. trainers who were killed and two others who were wounded in a shooting incident today at the Jordan International Police Training Center southeast of Amman. \xc2\xa0I understand that in addition to the Americans who were involved that there was a South African trainer and a Jordanian trainer who were killed. \xc2\xa0I also know that there were other Jordanian and Lebanese individuals who were wounded. \xc2\xa0And as the President said, our heartfelt condolences go out to the families of all of those who were affected by this terrible incident. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe brave individuals who were killed and injured were training Jordanian, Lebanese and Palestinian security forces. \xc2\xa0And a cowardly act like this one only reinforces the determination of the United States and our partners around the world to stand up with those countries that are trying to build the kind of police force and law enforcement that\xe2\x80\x99s critical to preserving security and order inside their countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we strongly condemn this incident. \xc2\xa0And we deeply appreciate the cooperation and support that we\'ve already received from our Jordanian partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu this morning, the President mentioned, short of a two-state deal that the administration sees as unlikely during the rest of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term, he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see discussed with Netanyahu ways to lower tensions, get Israelis and Palestinians back on a path toward peace. \xc2\xa0Did he get any kind of a road map from Netanyahu? Did he have any specific asks for the Prime Minister? \xc2\xa0And any details from Netanyahu about what he might be willing to do in that regard?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, as I walked out here, the meeting between the President and Prime Minister was still ongoing, so that\'s going to limit my ability to provide a particularly detailed readout of their conversation. \xc2\xa0The expectation -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0This item was on the agenda. \xc2\xa0And I think you heard both leaders refer to it in the comments that Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama made to all of you before their meeting began. \xc2\xa0And the reason that this is on the agenda is it obviously goes to something that is a top priority of both leaders, which is the safety and security of the nation of Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd President Obama believes that the security interests of the people of Israel are best served and even advanced through reaching a two-state solution to try to resolve that conflict. \xc2\xa0And that long-simmering conflict has continued to create the kind of instability that allows violence to take root. \xc2\xa0And President Obama, and obviously Secretary Kerry, and Secretary Clinton before him, invested a lot of time and effort in trying to bring both sides to the negotiating table to facilitate an outcome here along the lines of a two-state solution that the United States has long advocated. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd ultimately, what is clear is that the political leaders on both sides are going to have to make some difficult decisions, including some decisions that in the short term may be politically unpopular with their people, but over the long term are going to be critical to the success and advancement of people on both sides of that issue. \xc2\xa0So the President continues to stay ready to facilitate those kinds of conversations. \xc2\xa0But obviously we\'ve got a long way to go before something like that is likely to occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just on one other topic, does the President agree with the anti-doping commission\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, recommendation that Russian track and field athletes be banned from the Olympics as a result of what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling the Russian government\xe2\x80\x99s complicity in some of this doping activity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, I\'ve seen those reports today. \xc2\xa0Obviously this anti-doping commission is an international organization that\'s independent of any specific government body, certainly independent of the United States government. \xc2\xa0And those kinds of decisions will ultimately have to be made by the international authorities that govern these athletic competitions. \xc2\xa0So we certainly made note of those reports, but ultimately Russia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement and the degree to which their track and field team is involved in the next Olympics will be something that those anti-doping authorities and Olympic authorities will ultimately have to determine.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back to Burma. \xc2\xa0Does this election have any further implications for sanctions, business links, or trade?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\'t have any changes to announce with that regard. \xc2\xa0Obviously this is something that the Treasury Department closely monitors, so I\'d refer you to them for any changes they may be planning. \xc2\xa0But I\'m not aware of any right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if the military accepts the results of this election, would the United States reconsider military-to-military ties with Myanmar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, it\'s too early to suggest exactly what changes in U.S. policy would be brought about by the outcome of this election and the way that it\'s received by all sides. \xc2\xa0During the President\xe2\x80\x99s two visits to Burma now, you have seen not just a willingness but a desire to deepen the ties between our two countries and to deepen the relationship between the United States and Burma. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\'t have any possible policy changes to announce.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the meeting with the Prime Minister -- and I recognize that it\'s still ongoing -- but are you able to say whether or not Prime Minister Netanyahu remarks to Congress earlier this year came up or will come up during their one-on-one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s address will be discussed. \xc2\xa0I know that the issue of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was an item that was on the agenda. \xc2\xa0As the President alluded to in his remarks before the meeting, while there may be a disagreement between our two countries about this particular diplomatic agreement, there is no disagreement and no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes to our commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and our desire to cooperate to prevent or at least mitigate the destabilizing activities that Iran often engages in in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, you opened up your remarks today by talking about the Paris conference. \xc2\xa0Does the United States come with anything in hand to that conference? \xc2\xa0Obviously the President has already announced the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s commitment on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \xc2\xa0What else does he bring this time as a bargaining chip to help push leaders in the direction that he wants them to go?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, at this point, I think that you have seen the United States make a substantial contribution and substantial commitment to handling business in our own country when it comes to reducing carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0And we saw that that firm commitment on the part of the United States elicited a similarly strong commitment from the Chinese government in terms of capping their carbon emissions and making investments in renewable energy and other technologies that will allow their economy to continue to grow, but while making decisions that are clearly in the best interest of the public health of the citizens of that country, but also the public health of citizens across the planet.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that obviously was an important step. \xc2\xa0We talked about this a little bit on Friday, that many skeptics of climate policy in the United States suggested that it was foolish for the United States to begin to take important steps to cut carbon pollution because those steps wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have nearly the intended impact if we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get China and other of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economies to go along. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think what\xe2\x80\x99s notable about that announcement is it directly takes on the chief criticism of our political opponents, and it does demonstrate that by using our influence around the globe and by making progress on this bold policy agenda of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, that we can do something important for the planet. \xc2\xa0We can do something important for the health and well-being of our kids here, who are obviously the first affected by poor air quality, but we can also do something good for our economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s notable about the commitment that China made to cap their carbon emissions is that it was going to require investment in new technology to generate power in that country. \xc2\xa0And one source of that power generation is nuclear power plants, and those are nuclear power plants that will be constructed at least in part by U.S. companies. \xc2\xa0So this is economic growth and jobs that are being created here in the United States because of this global commitment to doing something about climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My question is, is that what the President brings, basically a discussion of everything that he has done? \xc2\xa0Or is there anything else in the bag or in his hand that he will bring as an incentive to get other countries to move along?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out necessarily any future commitments. \xc2\xa0But the kinds of commitments that the United States has already made are significant and have elicited significant commitments from other countries already. \xc2\xa0And I think they make clear that President Obama is determined to show American leadership on this issue, and that based on the U.S. commitment to this issue, other countries can feel confident in following through on their commitments, knowing that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have the desired effect, knowing that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to confront the significant challenge of climate in this country and on this planet.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a new story that\xe2\x80\x99s getting a lot of momentum, particularly after this weekend, out of the University of Missouri, the race issues. \xc2\xa0The Governor of Missouri, Governor Nixon, and Senator Claire McCaskill, an alum of the school, chimed in. \xc2\xa0Is the President saying anything about this? \xc2\xa0And what does the White House say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April, I haven\'t spoken to the President about this new story, but I did read quite a bit about it over the weekend myself. \xc2\xa0Missouri is my home state. \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t attend the University of Missouri, but it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a campus that I visited many times and I have many friends who attended there. The people of Missouri are justifiably proud of that institution of higher learning and the people of Missouri take great pride in the institution that is the University of Missouri. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think what is notable about many of the events that we saw over the weekend is the way that that campus has really rallied together in support of the idea that every student that is admitted to the University of Missouri has a place on that campus and in that community. \xc2\xa0And that commitment to unity and equality and justice is one that I think the people of Missouri and certainly the Mizzou community can be proud of. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t get that result -- the result of every student on campus feeling like they have a place -- by just hoping that it will happen. \xc2\xa0It requires work. \xc2\xa0It required painstaking effort. \xc2\xa0And I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a commitment on the part of so many different members of that community to pursue that goal. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a really important thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think this also illustrates something that the President talked a lot about in the context of -- in his campaign, that a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact on the communities where we live and work. \xc2\xa0This was a small group of students who stood up to make their voices heard and their views clear and their concerns public. \xc2\xa0And this had an impact on people all across that campus, including members of the football team, who obviously speak with quite a loud voice. \xc2\xa0But they were able to count on the support of their coaches, other members of the faculty. \xc2\xa0I read in some of the news reports that the highest-ranking administration official on campus in Columbia actually spent time yesterday bringing food to the students who were camped out in protest, and spending time talking to those student leaders. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of dialogue and work and unity that the Mizzou community is going to need to make progress on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you say it was a small group of people, and I understand that. \xc2\xa0But this small group of people made a very loud noise with racial slurs, anti-Semitic graffiti, Swastikas drawn in feces. \xc2\xa0I mean -- and I hate to be that graphic, but this is real. \xc2\xa0Does this require the Justice Department to possibly take a look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there? \xc2\xa0I mean, you have four campuses in that system, and you have had to have the football team force the president of the university to step down. \xc2\xa0So do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Justice Department to come and take a look? \xc2\xa0I mean, I heard you talk about the conversation, but this is a little bit deeper than a conversation. \xc2\xa0And you also had a Confederate flag -- and you\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to show who you support, freedom of expression -- but a Confederate flag driving around that university at this time where tensions are still hot.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, just to be clear about my first answer, April, when I was referring to a small group of people, I was talking to the small group of students at the University of Missouri who decided to work together to make their voices heard, to raise these concerns, and to make sure the concerns of minority students on campus at the University of Missouri were getting the attention that they\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved. \xc2\xa0And that did inspire a broader movement and a broader statement from what started out as a group of some of the members of the football team and grew into the support of the entire team and the coaching staff. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the unity of purpose that exists on that campus. \xc2\xa0But that unity of purpose is not going to be enough. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned earlier, this is going to be hard work to eventually achieve this goal of making sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that every member of that community has a rightful place there, to be a contributor to that community, and to feel at home there. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s work that needs to be done. \xc2\xa0And I think I take great satisfaction, particularly when talking about my home state, in seeing so many people come together determined to make progress on a very difficult question that is laced with some difficult history in that state.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\'t agree with you there. \xc2\xa0But do you think at this point that there was a violation -- it was a hate crime or hate crimes, as well as civil rights violations that occurred on those four campuses?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that law enforcement officials would have to consider and the Justice Department will have to consider that on their own. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything here that would be perceived as in any way influencing any decisions that they may or may not have to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tChip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given your familiarity with Missouri and the University of Missouri, are you surprised about the kinds of acts that April just detailed -- the anti-Semitic and racist behavior on that campus?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there are a couple different ways to answer that question. \xc2\xa0I think any state institution is a product of the state and that state\xe2\x80\x99s history, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very painful history, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not ancient history in the state of Missouri. \xc2\xa0And again, I think it is a testament to the courage of the people on campus at the University of Missouri who are speaking out that they are standing up to confront those issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important, Chip -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we don\xe2\x80\x99t lose this in the debate either -- this debate has been going on -- this debate is not just occurring at the University of Missouri. \xc2\xa0There are discussions about some of these issues that are taking place in campuses all across the country. \xc2\xa0And I was just reading in the newspaper today that there\xe2\x80\x99s been some concerns about the environment at Yale right now. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very different situation -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a private institution; the University of Missouri is a public institution. \xc2\xa0The scale of -- the source of their concern is a little bit different, but it does go to this sort of fundamental issue about these college campuses, ensuring that there\xe2\x80\x99s a home for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we expect college campuses are going to be places where people\xe2\x80\x99s views are challenged and that there is a vibrant debate on campus. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we want to preserve. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what the best institutions of higher learning in this country have. \xc2\xa0But we also need to make sure that everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s on that campus feels like they have a home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is this a teachable moment that the President might weigh in on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point whether or not he would make a public statement on it. \xc2\xa0But presumably, the next opportunity that one of you has to talk to him, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask him about it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow that? \xc2\xa0But why not, though? \xc2\xa0I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and we have heard some of this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling it out, April. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that he could? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I suppose you can say that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, let me ask you this, though. \xc2\xa0Some are trying to inference that this situation that\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the University of Missouri is an outgrowth of Ferguson, possibly, because of many of the protests. \xc2\xa0This nation right now is still dealing with issues of race, be it the police in the black community issue or some other issues. \xc2\xa0You were hearing a lot of the tension from some of the candidates when it comes to other communities. \xc2\xa0This White House, and any White House, is the moral setter for the climate. \xc2\xa0And going back to Bill Clinton, he tried to talk about the heart issue, not just the legislative issue of race. \xc2\xa0Do you think that it could be time for this President, who is African American, to talk about the heart issue of race as this nation is a nation that is brown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think that he\xe2\x80\x99s done that many, many times, and I would anticipate that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, but I\'m saying more than just in a press conference, maybe have a dialogue, a town hall? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything like that right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything further on the downing of the Russian plane that you can point to as an indication it was terrorism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, Jon, I don\'t have an updated intelligence assessment. \xc2\xa0We continue to work hard to collect as much information as we can to try to learn what exactly happened with that tragic incident. \xc2\xa0Again, based on the information that we\'ve already learned, we, at this point, can\'t rule out the possibility of terrorist involvement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as we collect information we do a couple of things with it. \xc2\xa0The first is we make sure that we\'re using that information to adjust appropriately the security posture at airports around the world. \xc2\xa0And there have been some steps that have been taken by the Department of Homeland Security to beef up security at a handful of airports in the region. \xc2\xa0We\'re also using that information to share it with investigators. \xc2\xa0Obviously the Egyptians and the Russians are leading this investigation, and when we have information that we can share with them, we\'re doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you agree with Congressman Adam Schiff, who said that if this bomb was truly planted by ISIS that ISIS has now fully eclipsed al Qaeda as the gravest terror threat in the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think at this point, it is important to understand that the United States, and certainly in recent months, has been keenly aware of the extremist threat that\'s emanating from the Sinai Peninsula, and that there have been travel warnings and notice to aircraft operating in the skies over Sinai Peninsula about precautions that they should take given the significant extremist threat there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, as it relates to that question, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a need on the part of the administration to take the threats both from ISIS and al Qaeda quite seriously. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99re not dissimilar, but they are threats that are worthy of our attention, and it\'s attention that it\'s received for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, but I -- because obviously the President in the past has suggested that core al Qaeda was the preeminent threat. And now you have this -- Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, saying that we may see a situation here if this was, in fact, ISIS, that ISIS is now the preeminent threat in the world today. \xc2\xa0And the President, in the past, has, quite frankly, kind of -- I don\'t want to say downplayed -- but in the comparison with al Qaeda, he has portrayed ISIS as the JV team, in the famous phrase in the New Yorker interview. \xc2\xa0But are we now at a point where ISIS is the preeminent threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that given the significant resources that have been committed to our counter-ISIL campaign and the fact that we\'ve been able to build the support of 65 countries to carry out a range of elements of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL I think is an indication --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The reason I say you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it, you\xe2\x80\x99ve made the case that it\'s a regional threat. \xc2\xa0Schiff is saying something more. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s saying this has now fully eclipsed al Qaeda as the gravest terror threat in the world, which would suggest it\'s far more than a regional problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\'ve been mindful of the risk that ISIL poses even outside the region. \xc2\xa0I think what we\'ve said is that most of their aspirations are focused on that region. \xc2\xa0But we\'ve noted the fact that they have attempted to radicalize people all around the globe, using social media, including to carry out acts of violence in places outside of the region. \xc2\xa0So we\'ve been mindful of the broader threat that ISIL poses. \xc2\xa0And at this point, I think what the President is focused on is making sure that all of the threats as they emerge are appropriately mitigated and that we\'re using the wide range of our military capability and our intelligence capability to try to protect the American people, whether that threat emanates from al Qaeda or from ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s one other -- you probably saw some of the controversy questions raised about Ben Carson and what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying about his personal -- I don\'t want you to comment on any of that. \xc2\xa0But he did say something about -- (laughter) -- if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to comment. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0He did say that he does not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Obama in 2008. I\'m assuming he means Senator Obama. \xc2\xa0But then-candidate Obama. \xc2\xa0He suggested that Barack Obama had nothing of this kind of scrutiny when he was running for President. \xc2\xa0Do you agree with that -- that Ben Carson has been subject to more scrutiny than Barack Obama? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t agree with that statement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\'t? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think many of you who have covered both the 2008 campaign and this campaign I think can obviously draw your own conclusions, based on the work that all of you have done. \xc2\xa0I think the important thing, Jon, is for people to remember -- and this is sort of one thing that I have frequently said about the ongoing presidential race that I, at that time, was reluctant to weigh in on -- is that this process is good for our democracy. \xc2\xa0It\'s not easy to run for President. \xc2\xa0It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. \xc2\xa0And people, when they make public comments, are going to have their claims scrutinized even if they are claims about their own biography. \xc2\xa0And that\'s part of the process. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it was difficult when those questions were raised about Senator Obama. \xc2\xa0It was particularly difficult when some of those claims were -- questions were -- I guess in 2008, I recall a situation in which it was less the claims of President Obama that we\'re being questioned and more that the claims about him were difficult to disprove, at least to the satisfaction of our harshest critics. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When he was running for President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When he was running for President. \xc2\xa0But what\xe2\x80\x99s true now is a situation where you have Dr. Carson\xe2\x80\x99s own claims that he has long been making and written about that are being subjected to scrutiny. \xc2\xa0And that\'s an important part of the process. \xc2\xa0It ensures that whoever emerges from this difficult process is somebody that\'s capable of leading the country, but most importantly, it gives voters the opportunity to carefully consider the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 views and their claims in depth before they have to go to the voting booth or show up at a caucus location.</p>\n<p>\n\tSenator Obama -- a staple of his stump speech used to be that he would travel to Iowa and he spent so much time going to town hall meetings and talking to people in coffee shops because people liked to lift the hood and kick the tires. \xc2\xa0And it\'s good to know that that tradition is alive and well because it\'s important to the success of our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0These are appropriate questions that Ben Carson is facing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\'s not really -- I happen to think that they are. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, that\'s for the American people to judge. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was pretty striking today to hear Prime Minister Netanyahu express so emphatically his commitment to a two-state solution, which is a lot different than what we heard from him just a couple of months ago. \xc2\xa0So to what extent does the President believe that he is truly committed to that? \xc2\xa0And what does the White House expect to see in terms of that commitment coming from Israel right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, those kinds of comments are obviously encouraging, but what\xe2\x80\x99s most important will not be the comments but the follow-through. \xc2\xa0And the more important judge of that follow-through than the United States will be the Israeli people, the Palestinian people, and the leaders of the Palestinian people -- that ultimately, for this kind of two-state solution to take root, or for at least us to advance the process in that direction, both sides are going to need to take some steps to build confidence in one another. \xc2\xa0And it means that we\'re going to need to see a reduction if not an end to the violence. \xc2\xa0We certainly are going to need to see an end to the incitement. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to need to see a willingness on the part of both sides to engage constructively.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to be fair about it, one thing that we have said is that continued Israeli settlement construction is counterproductive to that process. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some work that both sides need to do, but the United States will continue to strongly support that process. We certainly believe it\'s in the best interests of the leaders of the people on both sides for the process to move in that direction. \xc2\xa0And the United States will continue to be helpful as they do, but the United States will also stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies in Israel when it comes to their security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s an important part of the conversation taking place today as well about how the United States can take the historically strong connections between our military and our intelligence communities and further deepen those connections and further intensify that coordination to provide for the security of the nation of Israel, but also to augment the security architecture of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you believe what Netanyahu says about wanting that two-state solution and wanting peace when we all know that that settlement activity only continues no matter how many times the White House expresses its displeasure at that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, I think the way to judge the priorities of any government is to take a look at what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing and to examine the follow-through. \xc2\xa0And this is certainly an opportunity for Prime Minister Netanyahu to try to put forward some ideas to move this process in the direction of a two-state solution. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think we\'ve been quite candid about the fact that given the dynamic on both sides, that it\'s unlikely that that two-state solution will be reached in the next 14 months. \xc2\xa0It\'s even unlikely that talks in pursuit of that two-state solution will begin in the next 14 months. \xc2\xa0But if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything we can do to try to move the process in that direction, then we certainly want to be supportive of the efforts on both sides to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can we be virtually assured then that President Obama will bring up the settlement activity? \xc2\xa0And is there ever going to be a situation where you arrive at something that the next MOU would be affected by that, or if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop, then it\'s going to affect the amount of assistance that Israel gets? \xc2\xa0Or would you say that those things are completely separate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, for whether or not it came up in the meeting, I can\'t speak to that because, as I mentioned, it was still ongoing when I walked out here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you expect it to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I would expect is that there would be a discussion about trying to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and steps that Israel could take to move that process in the direction of a two-state solution. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to settlement building, I don\'t know if it will come up in the context of their talks, but it certainly is not a position that we have been reluctant to state either publicly or privately.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the commitment of the United States to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, that commitment is unshakeable -- and for a variety of reasons. \xc2\xa0The first is that Israel is the strongest ally of the United States in that region of the world, and improving and strengthening Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is good for the national security of the United States, to say nothing of the important ties between the U.S. and Israeli people and the values that we share that both countries and citizens of both countries hold dear.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of reasons about why those bonds are so strong. \xc2\xa0And those bonds are unshakeable. \xc2\xa0And we may have our disagreements about how to pursue our shared objectives, as we saw on display as we completed the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0We even have some differences of opinion when it comes to the peace process. \xc2\xa0But that has not affected the commitment of this administration or this country to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And also, we\'ve heard from now the Israeli Defense Minister that it was likely that a bomb brought down that Russian plane. \xc2\xa0The British Prime Minister said it was likely to be a bomb. \xc2\xa0We\'ve heard from intelligence officials, members of Congress saying that this is likely terrorism, that the intelligence is pointing that way. \xc2\xa0So why has the White House been so reluctant to say that the evidence that the U.S. has is at the very least pointing strongly in that direction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Michelle, I just don\'t have an updated intelligence assessment to share. \xc2\xa0I think at least with all due respect to those members of Congress, they have a little more latitude to make those kinds of pronouncements than I do or other individuals who represent the U.S. government are able to. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to continue to learn as much as we can about what exactly occurred, and if and when we have an updated intelligence assessment to share with all of you, then we\'ll do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrancesca.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Earlier you noted to April that the next time you get to talk to the President perhaps you can ask about Missouri and some of these other issues -- which brings me to the point that I brought up to you when you gave the week ahead last Friday, which was that there was not a joint news conference today between the President and the Prime Minister. \xc2\xa0And looking back through the history of every time the Prime Minister has been at the White House, there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have ever been a joint news conference between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama at this White House. \xc2\xa0And I wanted to ask you about that. \xc2\xa0You couldn\'t say before why there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be one today, but I wanted to know if you could explain that now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think primarily, Francesca, the goal was to spend most of their time talking to each other and a little less time talking to the press. \xc2\xa0And I hope you all don\'t take personal offense at that. \xc2\xa0You shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0I think it just reflects -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.) (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I should have predicted. \xc2\xa0I think it just reflects the way that the schedule came together and their desire to cover what I think is a quite wide-ranging agenda. \xc2\xa0Both men, however, do feel a responsibility to make sure that the citizens of the United States and Israel are aware of their conversations. And so that\'s why both men spoke to representatives of the press in the Oval Office today. \xc2\xa0And it\'s why I\'m out here trying to answer your questions the best I can about what they discussed. \xc2\xa0And I assume that someone -- a member of Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s traveling party is doing something similar.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s fine. \xc2\xa0I do remember that when President Obama traveled to Israel for an important meeting that Prime Minister Netanyahu hosted that they did have a news conference there. \xc2\xa0And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the same homework that you did, but I wouldn\'t be surprised that in at least one of the previous pool sprays that the two leaders hosted in the Oval Office if the leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a shouted question occasionally.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is this is an important meeting and we certainly have an interest in making sure that they can have a robust private conversation, but also an interest in making sure that all of you and the American people understand exactly what was on the agenda and what progress we were able to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if I may, I did do a little bit more homework on that, and they have taken questions in the past during the pool sprays. \xc2\xa0At first I thought maybe it was because the pool spray came at the top of the meeting, but in my research I also found that at times in the past they had taken questions even when the pool spray came at the top of the meeting. \xc2\xa0But that also brings me to another point, though, as to why the pool spray wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the bottom of the meeting to where questions about what was discussed could have been asked so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to keep badgering you about what happened in a meeting that ended after you came into this room.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s good to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not offended. \xc2\xa0But, look, I think what they wanted to do was try to give both the American people and the Israeli people a sense of what was on the agenda for their meeting. \xc2\xa0And I do think they also wanted to protect their ability to have private conversations that, with regard to a couple of the items on the agenda, they\xe2\x80\x99re a work in progress. \xc2\xa0And that would certainly include the effort to move forward on a memorandum of understanding when it comes to military assistance that the United States provides to Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have future opportunities to talk about the importance of this relationship and the importance of the conversation that took place this morning and may even still be underway in the Oval Office as we speak.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Mr. Earnest. \xc2\xa0In keeping with Israel relations, in March, in the wake of the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s backing away from a two-state solution on the eve of the elections, and some other comments he had made as the elections were nearing, you said -- I believe it was you said we\xe2\x80\x99re going reevaluate our thinking about the relationship, particularly as it pertains to the U.S. stance at the United Nations. \xc2\xa0What is the status of that reevaluation? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Mike, what I talked about at that point was a reassessment of our position toward the two-state solution. Our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security and our alliance with Israel is something that is unshakeable and has not been called into question, despite the spirited disagreement that we had over the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, for example. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there was a reassessment that was conducted about our policy toward a two-state solution, and whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s something that was viable moving forward given the public comments of Prime Minister Netanyahu earlier this year. \xc2\xa0And essentially, part of the outgrowth of that reassessment was the observation that was made at the end of last week by White House officials that a two-state solution was not going to happen while President Obama was still in office, and that even the possibility of talks about a two-state solution between the Israelis and the Palestinians was unlikely over the course of the next 14 or 15 months.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, if there is an opportunity for us to try to move the process in that direction, short of talks, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the United States remains committed to primarily because we believe that ultimately resolving this conflict would be in the best interest of American national security, but resolving this conflict in the context of a two-state solution would also be in the best interest of both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a goal that we still believe in. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a goal that we believe the Israelis and Palestinians should pursue. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a goal that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be reached in the remainder of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Different subject, please. \xc2\xa0Guantanamo. \xc2\xa0Does the President have the constitutional authority to close Guantanamo notwithstanding the will of Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there was a high-profile argument made over the weekend --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And all your comments here --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure, sure. \xc2\xa0And I guess my point is that the argument about the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority is certainly something that Mr. Craig is well positioned to make. \xc2\xa0But the focus of our efforts right now is on Congress. \xc2\xa0And there are members of Congress who share this goal and who have indicated at least an openness to trying to working with the administration to achieve this goal. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of our efforts right now. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any ongoing effort to devise a strategy using only the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority to accomplish this goal, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, as I mentioned last week, take that option off the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a consideration -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no thinking of an ongoing option, or however you just phrased it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a consideration of a legal standing and legal opinion and legal abilities, constitutional authority. \xc2\xa0What is the status of that thinking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are a wide range of thorny, legal questions that are raised by this ongoing effort to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sort of speculate on those right now. \xc2\xa0These are obviously -- in some cases, because of the unique nature of this facility, in some cases we\xe2\x80\x99re in uncharted legal waters here. \xc2\xa0But the President made clear from his first week in office that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a national security priority, and this is a conclusion that was share by former President George W. Bush. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a conclusion that is shared by Secretaries of State that have served Presidents dating all the way back to Nixon. \xc2\xa0I know that the three most recent Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Admiral Mullen, General Dempsey, and obviously General Dunford -- all share this view. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the brightest and most influential foreign policy thinkers in America who are most focused on national security are convinced that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay is an important thing to do because it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country and good for our security. \xc2\xa0We just got to get Congress to go along.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give away the game, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to speculate. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the White House has an opinion as to the legality or the constitutional power the President has to close it without the will of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say is I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- presumably somebody, somewhere, has done some kind of analysis on this. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of what that analysis was or what the conclusion was. \xc2\xa0All I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that our top priority is to work with Congress to get this done. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to take off the table any fallback options that may or may not be available to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When will either see the plan or know the plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been working on for quite some time, and there\xe2\x80\x99s some legwork that the Department of Defense has engage in in terms of making site visits and doing some other planning so that they can present a thoughtful, carefully considered plan to Congress. \xc2\xa0And our hope right now is that Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t just reflexively play politics with that plan, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll actually devote a similar level of thought and consideration to this proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The meeting with the Prime Minister, how did this come about? \xc2\xa0Did Prime Minister Netanyahu request the meeting? \xc2\xa0Why did the President invite him at this time now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, I have to admit I don\xe2\x80\x99t recall sort of who invited whom here. \xc2\xa0But I do know that there was a desire on the part of both leaders to sit down and renew their engagement. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been more than a year since they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to meet in person. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously spoken on the phone a number of times in that period. \xc2\xa0But this is an opportunity for them to sit down and talk about all the things we have in common. \xc2\xa0Our shared values and our shared national security priorities are far more numerous than even some of the significant disagreements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I ask because obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot said about the personal dynamic between them, which is why I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of -- if you can say -- who made the -- who reached out their hand first, if you will.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have that in front of me. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember what the answer to that question is. \xc2\xa0But I guess I would suggest that that\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the most effective way to draw a conclusion about their interpersonal relationship. I think both of them would be the first to tell you that they have an effective, professional relationship that allows them to advance the interests of their two countries, and to, most importantly, advance our shared interests. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what you expect the leaders of allied nations to do, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what President Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu have successfully done for seven years now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And when you came out, I think the meeting had been going on for more than two hours, roughly. \xc2\xa0Did you have a sense of how it was going?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did. \xc2\xa0There were a couple different sort of configurations of the meeting with a number of staff in the room, and so I did talk to one staff member who was in the room for a good chunk of the meeting this morning. \xc2\xa0And he observed that this was an important opportunity for the two sides to get together and discuss something that had been discussed among other members of their respected national security teams. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor, had an opportunity to visit with her counterpart. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the Defense Minister for Israel, Mr. Ya\xe2\x80\x99alon, was in the United States a couple of weeks ago meeting with his counterparts here in the United States. \xc2\xa0General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was in Israel a couple of weeks ago to meet with some of his counterparts. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of work done in preparation for this meeting, and this was an opportunity for them to follow up on that preparatory work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And based on your conversation with that aide, can you give us any sense of how the beginning of this meeting unfolded? What issues came up first? \xc2\xa0Where did they go? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The part of the meeting that he talked about was some of the work that both sides, I think, are interested in doing to advance our military cooperation. \xc2\xa0And this was part of -- this is the work that will go into what hopefully will be the signing of a memorandum of understanding to plan for the continued military cooperation between our two countries, and the military assistance that the United States will provide to ensure that Israel has the capacity to defend herself.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe discussion centered on the need to conduct a careful assessment of the broader security situation in the Middle East to assess what sort of threats and risk Israel faces, and then also to conduct an assessment of the capabilities and technology and equipment that Israel already has, and assess how those current capabilities match up with the current assessment of the threats, and then determine what sort of assistance the United States can provide to try to bridge that -- to sort of bridge that gap.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I describe that to you to make clear that I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate, even though I walked out here before the meeting ended -- I do not anticipate that there will be a commitment on the memorandum of understanding today. \xc2\xa0But there was a discussion about the work that can be done cooperatively among the national security teams to advance this process. \xc2\xa0And the process will look like what I just described to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned the reassessment of the two-state solution policy. \xc2\xa0Those statements were very definitive, that the United States -- the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see this happening on his watch. \xc2\xa0Why was that made so public just before the Prime Minister came? \xc2\xa0And was that communicated to him before he came? He had to be aware of it, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t get the impression that officials in the Israeli government were particularly surprised by those comments. \xc2\xa0For that matter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are many officials in the U.S. government that were surprised by that assessment. \xc2\xa0Given the nature of the situation there right now, and given the pretty stark divide between the Israeli leaders and Palestinian leaders right now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that is going to need to be done to try to bridge those gaps and even get them back into a place where they can sit down at the negotiating table and have a trusted conversation. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure that that work to get them back to the table will be completed in the next 14 months. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that it will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given that assessment -- I hate to be blunt, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that they\xe2\x80\x99re committed to peace sound very hollow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t to me, at least. \xc2\xa0And I think that Prime Minister Netanyahu has a solemn responsibility when he\xe2\x80\x99s leading the nation of Israel. \xc2\xa0He was elected by the people of that country to protect that country, and particularly mindful of the grave risks that that country faces given the dangerous neighborhood in which they live.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I think the best way, however, for people to assess how genuine those claims are is to see the degree to which his administration is willing to follow through on those comments. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what the Obama administration will be doing, and I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate that other governments around the world will be doing the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you think it is possible that the Prime Minister could return home and initiate some policies that could reverse your perception of -- the administration\xe2\x80\x99s perception that the two-state solution is dead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is possible that Prime Minister Netanyahu could make some commitments and send some quite clear signals that they\xe2\x80\x99re recommitted to trying to advance a peace process and a process toward a two-state solution. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out, though, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not going to be enough. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a commitment on the part of the Palestinian leaders too, to ending violence and ending incitement, and demonstrating their commitment to negotiating in good faith. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd those shows of good faith aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kinds of things that materialize over time, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t inspire faith. \xc2\xa0Let me say that again. \xc2\xa0They aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kinds of things that materialize immediately, and they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the kinds of things that demonstrate faith or inspire faith immediately. \xc2\xa0These are the kinds of things that can be -- these are the kinds of policy changes that can be instituted over time. \xc2\xa0And over time, they will build sufficient confidence and sufficient faith to bring both sides back to the negotiating table and try to advance toward a goal that serves the interests both sides. \xc2\xa0In some ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s what continues to be tragic about the situation -- that I think there is pretty widespread agreement about what is in the best interest of people on both sides of this conflict, but yet, despite that recognition, the two sides haven\'t been able to reach it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, is the President going to press the Prime Minister, or do you think he did, on this particular issue of the two-state solution? \xc2\xa0And is there going to be any follow-up post this meeting with the Palestinian side by any level of the administration? \xc2\xa0Or do you think that this is really just something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to, well, not fall by the wayside, but fall by the wayside unless you see something clear and bold by the Israelis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be -- that at some level there will be some follow-up with the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0As you know, Secretary Kerry, while he obviously frequently talks to Prime Minister Netanyahu, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not unusual for him to have conversations with President Abbas either. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that that will take place at that level, but I just do that to illustrate the kind of open line of communication that exists between the United States and the Palestinian Authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect much?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that there are some important things that we can advance. \xc2\xa0And I think there is an opportunity for us to lay out a path to eventually completing a memorandum of understanding. \xc2\xa0This is the kind of security assistance that is clearly in the best interest of the United States and our national security, but is also critical to making sure that Israel has the capacity to defend itself when necessary. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere continue to be, as the President alluded to at the top of the meeting, a conversation about the work that can be done to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing compliance with the agreement, and our work together to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the region that pose a threat to the United States and our interests but also pose a pretty direct threat to Israel as well. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s important work that needs to be done, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think all of the biggest problems are going to be solved just in the context of this meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about a different topic. \xc2\xa0Senator Reid and Leader Pelosi have been pushing to repeal with the Cadillac tax as part of Obamacare. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House is willing to negotiate on that pay-for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jordan, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about that specific policy. \xc2\xa0And the reason that this is important is, the first is that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the Affordable Care Act to be a fiscally responsible plan. \xc2\xa0And this is part of ensuring that we can make progress on the fiscal scale. \xc2\xa0And one of the important benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it actually reduces the deficit. \xc2\xa0And that fiscally responsible approach to this challenge is an important part of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that this policy does is it gives employers with high-cost plans an incentive to make those plans more efficient. \xc2\xa0And there is academic research to indicate that as those plans become more efficient, the money that had previously gone into those benefits actually go back into paychecks, go back into direct compensation to employees. \xc2\xa0So as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation about the fact that there is more work that can be done to raise wages in this country, this would actually be an important thing that we could do in a way that certainly still allows employees to enjoy the benefits of a high-quality health care plan, but also getting some greater compensation here. \xc2\xa0And raising paychecks and raising wages continues to be a top policy priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important, Jordan, for people to understand is that this law does not take effect until 2018. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to evaluate exactly how it would go into effect. And if in that intervening time there are ideas that are put forward that will strengthen the law, then we\xe2\x80\x99re open to a conversation about that. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s important that people not overlook the benefits of this policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you would be open to tweaks if, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, Democrats were to offer a different pay-for to make up for the deficit hole that getting rid of the Cadillac tax would?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to negotiate it from here. \xc2\xa0And that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t address all of the benefits that I raised here about it being important, particularly when it comes to the consequences or the impact of this policy proposal having a positive impact on wages.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo look, this is a policy that goes into effect in 2018. \xc2\xa0We are always in a position to have conversations with people that have an authentic interest in strengthening the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0The President has never taken the position that there aren\'t creative ways to further improve upon and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And if people have ideas for doing that, then we\'re open to that conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, so much of what has come out of Congress has been an effort to undermine and even repeal the law. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve spent so much time talking about that we haven\'t talked about some of the things that could be done to strengthen the law.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would note -- and we can follow up with you on the details on this -- but in the last six or eight weeks, the President has signed a couple of pieces of legislation that have slightly reformed the law in a way that strengthens it. \xc2\xa0And so we can follow up with the details on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two unrelated questions. \xc2\xa0First, on the ISIL-Russia thing, does President Obama plan to meet with President Putin at the G20 meeting or otherwise on this trip? \xc2\xa0And would you expect that they would discuss the downing of the Russian plane?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any planned meetings with Mr. Putin. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll have some more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule both for the G20 meeting but also for the rest of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip in the next couple of days. \xc2\xa0But I certainly wouldn\'t rule out the kinds of discussions that we\'ve seen in the past where they\xe2\x80\x99re either in the hallway together or in some other place where they have an informal opportunity to talk. \xc2\xa0But my point is that I do not know at this point of any sort of planned formal bilateral meeting between the two leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- some conversation about the downing of the plane?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If something like that occurs, we\'ll definitely let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the other question -- Volkswagen today offered to give a $500 rebate to all the people who owned the cars that have been implicated in the cheating emissions scandal and I guess the dealership credit as well. \xc2\xa0Some of the Democratic members of Congress I think, including Senators Blumenthal and Markey, said this was an insulting offer. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\'t weigh in on this. \xc2\xa0Obviously Volkswagen is dealing with a pretty significant challenge and I\'m not going to evaluate their crisis communications effort from here. \xc2\xa0Maybe at a future stage in my career I\'ll do that, but not in the current stage. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re not evaluating the crisis communications, they\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating the substance of what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing. \xc2\xa0Would you evaluate that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\'t.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, quick question. \xc2\xa0As you know, General Campbell has promised an initial findings report on the Afghan hospital bombing within a month, and that month passed. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s been interest on Capitol Hill where that initial report is. \xc2\xa0Can you say whether you know the progress that\'s being made there and whether the President has seen an initial report or a part of it yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that this is something that the Department of Defense has been working on and I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress on the report. \xc2\xa0But where it currently stands I\'m not able to comment on. \xc2\xa0What the President has said is that he expects a thorough, objective and full accounting of what exactly occurred and he expects the Department of Defense to be as transparent as possible about those findings. \xc2\xa0And so I would anticipate that once a final report has been completed that the President will take a look at it closely, but that as much of it as possible will be released to the public because that\'s the expectation the President has about the importance of being transparent with this accounting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just to clarify, to your knowledge, he has not received anything yet, or you\xe2\x80\x99d know that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0To my knowledge, he has not seen a draft report or an interim report, or anything like that. \xc2\xa0I can\'t speak to what degree he has gotten verbal updates or even updates that may be in a written form but not reflective of the final report. \xc2\xa0But I know the President is eager for that full accounting, but also wants to make sure that the review that\'s done is one that is thorough and objective and eventually transparent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A follow-up on Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0If the President is successful in taking the current number of detainees and prisoners shipped somewhere else and shutting the prison, does he mean shutting the prison and then removing all the prisoners who are there, or would he actually like to close the prison and dismantle it if he could under his presidency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You mean like the physical structure?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he envision the prison continuing to exist there without any population of detainees there? \xc2\xa0Or would he actually like symbolically to dismantle it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure what plans the Department of Defense would have for something like that. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if they would -- certainly the President would not envision leaving the building there or the facilities there in case the need arises to detain additional people there. \xc2\xa0The President does not envision that scenario. \xc2\xa0The goal of closing the prison is to ensure that we\'re living up to our values when it comes to dealing with these individuals. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t know what eventual plans the Department of Defense may have for the facilities there.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Has the gap interpersonally from a communications perspective between the President and the Prime Minister been overestimated? \xc2\xa0And if not, does a meeting like today\xe2\x80\x99s bridge such a gap?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think as the President said when he sat down with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, there\xe2\x80\x99s no world leader with whom he\xe2\x80\x99s had the opportunity to meet more often than Prime Minister Netanyahu. \xc2\xa0I think that\'s a testament to the bonds between our two countries. \xc2\xa0It\'s also a testament to the effectiveness of the working relationship between the two men. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they have agreed on every issue, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they are the best of friends. \xc2\xa0But it does mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re able to work effectively together to advance the interests of the citizens of their countries, but also to advance the shared interest of our alliance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will you be making an announcement on an aid package any time in the days ahead? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I certainly wouldn\'t anticipate an announcement on a memorandum of understanding in the near term. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some important work that needs to be done to conduct an analysis of the broader threats in the region, to conduct a review of the capabilities that Israel currently possesses, and then to do an analysis of how the United States could assist in meeting those unmet needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I wouldn\'t anticipate that that process will take a really long time, but it\'s not something that you can do quickly. The President wants to be thoughtful and strategic about this because this is essentially going to chart the course of our important military-to-military relationship over the next decade.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the shooting, was this an infiltration? \xc2\xa0Was this a friendly fire circumstance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Are you talking about the situation in Jordan?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I am.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is a situation that is still under investigation, and determining what the motive was of this individual, whether or not this person had some sort of affiliation that\'s unknown, at this point there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0We are pleased with won\'t cooperation that we\'ve gotten from the Jordanians thus far in trying to get to the bottom of what exactly happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say this person was not among the trainees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The role that this person had on the complex is something that is also part of the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On climate, you mentioned the importance of getting major economies in particular around the world involved in Paris. And I\'m curious about the burgeoning economy in India. \xc2\xa0Is there also a push to get the Indian government to make strategic steps to be a part of a larger global push to cut down on particulates into the atmosphere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We certainly would expect that India would contribute to this broader global effort. \xc2\xa0And this is something that is economically challenging for India, as the Indian government would be the first to tell you. \xc2\xa0But at the same time, we have seen India take important steps in the past, and there was earlier in the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration a commitment that was made by the Indians to limit hydrofluoric carbons. \xc2\xa0And these are pollutants that have a much more significant impact on bringing about climate change than just the burning of oil and gas. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s been a willingness on the part of the Indians in the past to make important commitments that contribute to this broader effort, but we certainly would like to see a country with an economy as large as India step up and make an important contribution to this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will they be a part of the events in Paris?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know what their plans are for Paris, but you can check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, I want to ask you about -- as a fellow native Missourian -- about what happened in Columbia today. \xc2\xa0What would you say to the people who feel like if a small group can effectively usher out the leadership of a major university like that, rather than work with the leadership through the grievance process, what does that say?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s notable about this particular situation is that you had a small group on campus mobilize other voices on campus that all spoke out together. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that this started -- I think the point is this did start with a small group of people, but you quickly saw them build support all across campus, even among the non-black student population. \xc2\xa0And I think that is, again, a testament to the shared values of that community and a commitment to fighting hate and intolerance, and promoting an atmosphere where all the students who were admitted to that university can find a home there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is a significant challenge that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just stand before the University of Missouri. \xc2\xa0This stands before colleges and universities all across the country. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that while the University of Missouri is apparently the first one to have such a high-profile debate about some of these issues, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident it\xe2\x80\x99s not the last.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering about the process. \xc2\xa0Rather than working with leadership to sort of usher out a university president in the wake of admittedly terrible situations on around the campus, I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing from lots of people in Missouri -- even family members -- who suggest to me that seems an extreme way to go about figuring out the best way forward for our community. \xc2\xa0Can you understand that perspective?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess -- I think I would disagree simply because we saw leaders on the Mizzou campus also speak up and raise concerns in this regard. \xc2\xa0We saw -- Coach Pinkel is one of the most influential voices on that campus, if not the most influential. \xc2\xa0Certainly the highest paid. \xc2\xa0And he made his voice heard in this process. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned earlier, I think it was Dr. Bowen -- who is the leading administrator with responsibility for the Columbia campus -- visit the students who were camping out in protest. \xc2\xa0And he brought them food, and spent some time talking to them yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think that is an indication that you saw people trying to bridge divides inside that community. \xc2\xa0And I think their willingness to come together to confront some of these issues and to confront head-on the concerns that had been raised by some of the black students at Missouri I think is an encouraging development. \xc2\xa0And these are concerns that initially fell on deaf ears. \xc2\xa0And because of the courage of those students to speak up, and their effectiveness in enlisting others in support of their cause, and the commitment on the part of the entire community to come together, even across racial lines, to stand up for the concerns that are expressed by one part of that community -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the legalities of the process, but as somebody is not steeped in those details, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good way for the process to work. \xc2\xa0And it certainly reflects the kind of -- I think it does reflect the way that we want our young people in this country to advocate for themselves and for their society. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a really interesting thing that\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the University of Missouri. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly -- to delve back into crisis communications -- these are probably not the kind of headlines that the University of Missouri would like to be making across the country, but I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason today for a lot of people affiliated with the University of Missouri to be quite proud of their institution today. \xc2\xa0And I hope that they are.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to follow on the Gitmo plan. \xc2\xa0Is the plan for the President to send it to the Hill this week? \xc2\xa0Is that what you said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put at timeframe on it. \xc2\xa0This is something that obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on for quite some time, and I know we talked about this even over the summer. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that\xe2\x80\x99s gone into this. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned, the Department of Defense personnel have visited locations in Kansas and in South Carolina and Colorado, so there\xe2\x80\x99s been some legwork on this project that\xe2\x80\x99s been visible; there\xe2\x80\x99s also been some other work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been visible yet. \xc2\xa0But when we put a plan forward, which hopefully will be relatively soon, we won\xe2\x80\x99t just make it public to members of Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it public so that all of you will have an opportunity to take a look at it as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any concern that it\xe2\x80\x99s too late because the NDAA has advanced already?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, there\xe2\x80\x99s not concern that it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. I think the sense is, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need some cooperation from Congress in order to advance this priority. \xc2\xa0And that would be true whether or not the NDAA had passed or not. \xc2\xa0So no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is the goal to influence the NDAA that sets policy for 2016? \xc2\xa0Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the one that\xe2\x80\x99s already passed in the House and is going to be taken up to the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If it has that effect, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So will the President be open to having the outlines of his plan set for policy in 2017, meaning that -- would he be satisfied with Guantanamo being on the track to close once he leaves office? \xc2\xa0Or his goal to have it completely closed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0His goal is to have it closed on his watch as he promised. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s been our goal since I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s second full day in office. \xc2\xa0It continues to be our goal today. \xc2\xa0The truth is, this is a goal we would have accomplished some time ago had Congress not gotten in the way. \xc2\xa0And the President is determined to make as much progress on this as he can, and his goal continues to be to close it before he leaves office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Netanyahu meeting, last week the President said that the goal was to have at the end of the meeting each leader give direction to their respective teams on how to move forward at the end of year. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about what direction is being given to the respective teams and what the next step would be in that process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this is part of what was under discussion, based on the readout that I received from the meeting this morning. \xc2\xa0And both leaders basically demonstrated a commitment to their teams working together in pursuit of a process that I laid out just little bit earlier -- conducting an analysis of threats in the region, particularly as they relate to Israel; conducting an analysis of the capabilities that Israel has to meet those threats; and conducting a review to determine what sort of assistance the United States could provide to try to bridge those gaps and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What I\'m asking is did the Israelis come with a specific list of things that they would want, and did the United States have a list of things that they were willing to do? \xc2\xa0Was it that kind of detail or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\'t speak to what list the Israelis may have brought along. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to our posture on this, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is this is something -- that we should sort of conduct this analysis first, and then we can start reviewing what sort of capabilities and equipment and technology could be used to bridge those gaps. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the most effective way for the President -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to pursue this.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0One of the big reasons that Israel says it needs a significantly larger commitment from the United States annually is because it says the world is much more dangerous because of the Iran nuclear deal. \xc2\xa0Obviously you\'re not going to confirm what\xe2\x80\x99s in a future memorandum of understanding, but would a significant increase especially of the military aid given annually be a tacit concession that the world is more dangerous because of the Iranian deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It would not, primarily because the President has made clear that our expectation that even after the completion of the agreement doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change -- is not likely to change Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior. \xc2\xa0Our expectation is that Iran will continue to carry out the kinds of destabilizing activities that do pose a pretty direct threat to Israel, but also pose a threat to our interests in the region. \xc2\xa0We\'re mindful of that threat. \xc2\xa0The United States and Israel work together regularly to counter that threat. \xc2\xa0If there\xe2\x80\x99s additional assistance that we can provide to the Israelis to further mitigate that threat, then we\'ll do that. \xc2\xa0But that\'s something we would have done whether or not we had succeeded in completing a deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does it say about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 ability to influence the positive or negative effects in the region when Israel says that it\'s more dangerous in the region now? \xc2\xa0Are we able -- or is this failure of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies in the Mideast beyond Iran that Israel believes that it\'s in much bigger danger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jared, I think I would just observe that the Middle East would be much more dangerous if Iran had a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve taken verifiable steps in the context of this agreement to prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But beyond -- I\'m talking about Syria and other parts of the region. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, one of the reasons that Syria is such a dangerous place is because Iran and their proxies have been heavily involved in trying to shore up the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0So I do think that is, while a different country, is a similar dynamic that the United States and Israel must confront together because it has risks for our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- a future potential increase for the annual military aid given to Israel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I\'d encourage you not to read anything into it, but rather to allow this analysis to move forward. \xc2\xa0And at some point in the months ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate we\'ll have another discussion about this.</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay. \xc2\xa0Thanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:14 P.M.
