EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here aboard Air Force One as we make our first trip of the second term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you probably saw that the President today announced the approval of an additional $155 million in humanitarian assistance to Syria.\xc2\xa0 This new commitment brings America\xe2\x80\x99s total humanitarian aid to Syria to $365 million, making us the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>This new American aid will provide medicine, flour, wheat and clean water, clothing, blankets, boots, and stoves; health care for victims of sexual violence, and field hospitals for the wounded.</p>\n<p>The dangers of operating in Syria mean that many Syrians may not know that the aid they are receiving is provided by the United States.\xc2\xa0 It is a cruel fact that humanitarian aid providers and recipients are being deliberately targeted in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Our priority is to get American aid to those in need without endangering them or our humanitarian partners, which is why much of our aid is provided quietly and without fanfare and acknowledgement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you talk generally about the President\xe2\x80\x99s mission today?\xc2\xa0 Is he negotiating the terms of comprehensive immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 Does he see his role more now as beginning to rebuild public support or trigger his campaign for passage of reform?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 The President is traveling today to essentially continue a conversation with the American people about the need for comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He talked about it a lot during the campaign.\xc2\xa0 He has supported it for much longer than that and pressed for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It was very clear both from the campaign itself and the results that the American people have -- that there is a consensus developing in the United States on the need to do this.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him speak frequently about it since the election and his commitment to move quickly to try to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That requires partners in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he will certainly note today the promising signs we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Congress, most specifically the bipartisan principles put together by a group of senators that mirror his own principles.\xc2\xa0 And that is cause for hope.</p>\n<p>And what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President today is how we need to take these initial positive steps and continue to move forward so that actual legislation is produced that can earn bipartisan support and that meets his principles so that he can sign it into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is I think -- we are at a stage here that is very positive and welcome and that reflects a consensus building around some principles that the President has long supported and an approach that the President has long espoused.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the fact that Republican senators, including Senators McCain, Rubio and Graham who have -- in the case of Senator McCain, in particular, who has long been associated with this issue, that he is taking it up again.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to working with Congress to achieve this major goal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Rubio has said that he won\xe2\x80\x99t support this -- any kind of reform that doesn\'t have strict standards for border security.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that that can be achieved if it\xe2\x80\x99s not tied to earned citizenship standards?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would note that under President Obama we have had the most comprehensive border security program in history, and the results bear that out.\xc2\xa0 Since 2004, we have doubled the number of boots on the ground along the border, raising the number of agents from approximately 10,000 to more than 21,000.\xc2\xa0 The number of Border Patrol agents along the northern border has increased 700 percent since 9/11.\xc2\xa0 More than 21,000 Customs and Border Protection officers, including 3,800 along the northern border, manage the flow of people and goods at our ports of entry and crossings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, since 2009, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deployed a quarter of all its operational personnel to the southwest border region.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also taken steps to enhance investigative resources, to step up surveillance along those borders.\xc2\xa0 And the effect of this can be measured by the fact that fewer people have been attempting to illegally cross our borders.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Fiscal Year 2012 apprehensions totaled nearly 365,000 nationwide; that\'s a 50 percent decrease from 2008.\xc2\xa0 And I will also be able to provide with you more information about the steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to enhance border security.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also refocused our efforts when it comes to deportations to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going after those who pose a threat -- criminals and others who pose a threat to our national security.\xc2\xa0 And the facts back up the success and the progress of that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President today that we need to continue to enhance our border security, that that is part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear from this President\xe2\x80\x99s record that he\xe2\x80\x99s very serious about this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But should the rest of an immigration reform package, as some Republicans are demanding, be linked to certain guideposts on border security?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the details here.\xc2\xa0 What you guys seem to be missing is the enormous consequence of the fact that the bipartisan principles put forward by senators include an acceptance of the need for a pathway to citizenship, and that is something the President and others who have supported this effort have long supported.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is the principles that the senators put forward mirror very closely to what the President has put forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But some of them want to link that pathway to their own border security ideas.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously these are going to -- the reason why you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President today call for action and no delay is that we need to move from principles to legislation, and details need to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to border security, A, this President\xe2\x80\x99s record is very strong already; and, B, he will make clear that as part of his approach to comprehensive immigration reform enhancing our border security needs to be included.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that he today will note the encouraging signs coming from Congress.\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans for him to sit down with the Senate working group or even, for example, to reach out to Senators McCain or Rubio and welcome them for coming on board and supporting a pathway to citizenship, for example?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings or conversations to preview for you today.\xc2\xa0 But you can be sure that the President, the White House, the administration looks forward to working with members of both parties in both houses to get this done, and that includes, obviously, the leaders of this bipartisan effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s already been a lot of response today from on some Republicans in the House coming out saying that they won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily support this, so is there a concern that the appetite that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the Senate might not be mirrored on the House side?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is a hard issue and there\'s no question that we will have to work together with Democrats and Republicans to make sure that we can get something that will pass both houses and the President can sign into law.\xc2\xa0 The fact that some members, lawmakers are not entirely supportive at this moment is not really the news.\xc2\xa0 The news this week is the progress that\'s been made towards bipartisan support for these principles and movement by members in the direction of comprehensive immigration reform, which the President supports.\xc2\xa0 And we want to build on that momentum, compel everyone to move forward so that we can actually take this moment and have it lead to actual legislation that can become law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gay rights advocated were disappointed that the Senate framework did not include extending immigration benefits for same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 Is that a problem for the President and the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it should be included and that should come as no surprise.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve said all along, this is consistent with the principles he has laid out over the last four years.\xc2\xa0 And the President has long believed that Americans with same-sex partners from other countries should not be faced with the painful choice between staying with the person they love or staying in the country they love.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s position on this is consistent with how we\'ve approached prosecutorial discretion at DHS and others.\xc2\xa0 So I think it should not be a surprise and it would be entirely inconsistent not to have that position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you have anything more on Egypt?\xc2\xa0 The army chief there today warned that the country could possibly collapse if these protests and the political crisis there continues.\xc2\xa0 Do you share that assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard from me yesterday our concern about the violence in Egypt and our call to all Egyptians to express themselves peacefully.\xc2\xa0 And we call on all Egyptian leaders across the political spectrum to make clear that violence and looting is not acceptable and to actively work to prevent further violence.\xc2\xa0 Egyptians need to engage in a peaceful process in order to reach a lasting solution to the current unrest.\xc2\xa0 This democratic process must adhere to the rights of all Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 And we look to the government of Egypt to ensure that the people\'s right to due process is protected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re closely monitoring what\'s happening in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And, again, as I said yesterday, a long-term solution here has to adhere to the rights of all Egyptians.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, was the decision on the additional humanitarian aid in Syria prompted by any sense of a specific deterioration and conditions on the ground or by feedback from other outside groups, the U.N. special rep, or anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think for specifics, you might want to address that to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 The situation on the ground has obviously been a concern to the United States and other nations.\xc2\xa0 The aid that we announced today comes on top of significant aid we\'ve already provided.\xc2\xa0 We already were the largest donor of humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 And the aid we\'ve announced today represents the administration\'s commitment to the Syrian people and assisting them in this very difficult time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I don\'t know of a specific trigger to that.\xc2\xa0 The amount of humanitarian aid has obviously been building as the crisis has continued.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a report that the U.S. signed a status of forces agreement in Niger, I believe it was, to have the option to put military personnel on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 Does that open the door to potential basing of drones in there or elsewhere in West Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Defense Department for possible basing options in the future.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We got an alert on LaHood right before we took off.\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on is he leaving?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Secretary LaHood is announcing that he is stepping down.\xc2\xa0 And you will hear -- will have a statement from the President about his appreciation for Secretary LaHood\'s exceptional service in his Cabinet, and his friendship.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s being announced as we fly west.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t10:25 A.M.
