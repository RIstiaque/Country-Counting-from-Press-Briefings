Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p3">1:22 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, you heard the President earlier today speak about the sanctions that we announced this morning against individuals over the situation in Ukraine and Crimea.\xc2\xa0 So beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take your questions.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask, on the sanctions, how President Putin might feel the impact of this.\xc2\xa0 On the call with the senior administration officials today, they said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t begin sanctions -- the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t typically begin them with a head of state.\xc2\xa0 But are they under consideration for a possibility in the future, or is that off the table under U.S. policy?\xc2\xa0 And might we see more of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle affected by these?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things, Nedra -- and those are all good questions.\xc2\xa0 The additional executive order that the President has signed allows for a more expansive series of categories that sanctions can then be applied against -- which is not a great sentence.\xc2\xa0 But, in other words, the individuals announced today have specific positions within the Russian government, or the State Duma.\xc2\xa0 The executive order that was announced today, while only one item on that list of -- one category was filled with individuals, there are other opportunities within that executive order to levy sanctions against other individuals who might have influence with Russian governmental officials and Russian policy.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one.</p>\n<p class="p4">Two, as the President signaled today, we have the capacity and the authority to calibrate our response -- in other words, initiate further sanctions depending on what happens in the coming days and weeks with regards to Ukraine and the actions that Russia decides to take.</p>\n<p class="p5">As the President made clear, we are still pressing Russia to pursue a diplomatic resolution to this situation in Ukraine, and that opportunity exists.\xc2\xa0 But should it fail to do that, should it take steps that further violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we have the authority to impose further sanctions and to do so more broadly.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could that include President Putin under U.S. policy?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what can I tell you is that the authority exists to apply sanctions to a variety of individuals and entities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to evaluate what the right step is as this situation evolves.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to rule out individuals or rule out actions, except to say that there will be costs imposed on Russia -- additional costs imposed on Russia if Russia does not change direction here when it comes to how it\xe2\x80\x99s handling the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another follow-up from that call with the senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 They said there was concrete evidence that some ballots arrived pre-marked in Crimea, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into specifics.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk more about what that evidence is?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics on that evidence.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics on the referendum itself.\xc2\xa0 As a matter of policy, in our view, it\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant because the referendum is not valid under the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that Russia took -- sending military forces into Crimea, basically seizing the peninsula and initiating a referendum that was conducted in the presence of armed Russian military forces\xc2\xa0 -- all render that whole process suspect and illegitimate.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics on that.</p>\n<p class="p4">I think that the way that referendum happened, the fact that it was called days after Russian military forces -- basically a foreign power\xe2\x80\x99s military forces seized the peninsula, says all you need to know about the illegitimacy of the process.\xc2\xa0 There is a way in Ukraine, under its laws and constitution, to decide matters of a regent status within Ukraine, or to change in any way Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial boundaries.\xc2\xa0 The way that Russia has pursued is obviously not legal under the constitution and not valid.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just finally, can you give us more of a readout of the meeting with Abbas?\xc2\xa0 Was there any chance the deadline that\xe2\x80\x99s coming up for the framework could be extended?\xc2\xa0 Or any indication that Abbas would recognize Israel as a Jewish state?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We may have further information about the meetings today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President spoke at the top of the bilateral meeting about the discussion he looked forward to having, because this is such a pivotal time in this process, in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 As he did with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Obama made clear that he appreciates the fact that both leaders have made tough decisions, but also underscored the fact that each leader has additional hard decisions to make in order to move this process forward.</p>\n<p class="p4">When it comes to the matter of the Israeli state, our view is quite clear that this process can and must end in a result that has a sovereign Palestinian state and a safe, secure, democratic Jewish Israeli state.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get into the status of negotiations over these difficult issues.\xc2\xa0 We want each side to press forward so that a framework for negotiations can be agreed to so the process can continue to move forward.\xc2\xa0 These are tough issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">It\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent on both sides to try very hard to put the decades of mistrust if not behind them, then in context as they pursue the interests of their own people, the interests of the Palestinian state that will emerge from a resolution and a secure, democratic Jewish Israeli state that can emerge from a resolution.</p>\n<p class="p3">As for the Palestinians, they have to recognize that the path to independence, sovereignty and security in their own state can only come through direct negotiations with Israel.\xc2\xa0 We have the opportunity now to achieve that goal, but only if, as I said, hard choices are made.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that, as is the case with Prime Minister Netanyahu, so it is with President Abbas:\xc2\xa0 He is the right leader to make these hard choices and to bring about a peace agreement with Israel.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just in terms of how you calibrate the sanctions -- say that Russia goes ahead and annexes Crimea, do you then come out with a longer list of names of people to sanction?\xc2\xa0 And what is more serious -- the annexation or the fact of the military incursion itself?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They both would be -- in the case of the annexation, and certainly with the military incursion that\xe2\x80\x99s already occurred -- very, very serious and very much in violation of international law and the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">The answer to your first question is, yes, there is the authority that exists in the two executive orders now signed to name additional individuals.\xc2\xa0 And work continues on what further steps we, the United States, can take -- working with our European partners -- to raise the cost to Russia, should Russia decide to continue down this path.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about military assistance to Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain keeps talking about that.\xc2\xa0 Have you completely ruled that out now?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t ruled any form of assistance out.\xc2\xa0 We are focused presently on providing the assistance that Ukraine needs most at this time, which is economic assistance, assistance in stabilizing its economy in this difficult time.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with Congress to have that occur.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working through the IMF, obviously, because any bilateral assistance would complement the assistance provided by the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with our European partners and allies who are also -- and our allies elsewhere in the world who are also mindful of the need to provide assistance to the Ukrainian government at this difficult time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re examining all sorts of possibilities when it comes to how we can help Ukraine in this challenging environment.\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on raising the costs on Russia for the actions that Russia has taken, making clear that there will be more costs and more isolation to Russia if they do not reverse course, and ensuring that steps are taken so that Ukraine is getting the economic assistance it needs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you at the point of decoupling the aid package from the IMF reforms that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been assisting?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are not, because we believe very strongly that the passage of IMF quota reforms serves the interests of providing additional assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So if that is an urgent priority for members of Congress, as it is for many members of Congress -- it certainly is for the President -- then that package, the bilateral assistance, the loan guarantee program plus the reforms to the IMF should pass together because that will allow for the greatest benefit to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It allows for more flexibility and leverage and greater assistance from the IMF to Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p5">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What happens if Russia goes ahead and makes this decision tomorrow to annex Crimea?\xc2\xa0 I suppose, what really could the U.S. do at that point?\xc2\xa0 You could impose further sanctions; you could widen the net of individuals who are caught up in these sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But have you considered at all that maybe Putin just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we have said, what the President made clear, and what I am reinforcing today is that further provocations, further steps along the path that Russia is currently on will result in further costs to Russia and further isolation for Russia.\xc2\xa0 Those costs are real and they are direct costs to individuals named in these sanctions announced today, direct costs when it comes to the individuals named by our European allies.</p>\n<p class="p3">There have been and will continue to be direct and significant costs to the Russian economy because of the actions that Russia has taken.\xc2\xa0 The Russian stock market has decreased as a result of the actions that have happened.\xc2\xa0 The ruble has lost value as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 And international investors who are looking for safe places to put their money are surely reevaluating any consideration they may give to putting their money in Russia and in Russian industries and the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 And those effects, those impacts will only compound as time passes and Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reverse course or engages in further provocations.</p>\n<p class="p3">So the fact is the more Russia does to violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, to unlawfully seize Ukrainian assets, to ignore Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty, the higher the price will be to Russia and the higher and more intense the isolation that Russia will suffer as a result of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">And obviously I\'m not going to try to psychoanalyze motivations, but it is a fact that Russia loses stature and influence in the world if it incurs these costs.\xc2\xa0 And that carries significance for I think the Russian people and for Russian leaders, and all the individuals surrounding the leaders of the Russian government who have great influence even if they don\'t hold positions in government.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to one of the items in the new executive order that identifies as potential targets of sanctions individuals who have great influence on the Russian government and on Russian policymakers but who may not hold themselves government positions.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does seem, though, that this is sort of all about Putin.\xc2\xa0 You can target the people around him, but isn\'t it really about him?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The people around him, Jim, have a great deal of influence in Russia and on the actions of the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anyone who has studied the Russian government and the power structure there would doubt that assessment.\xc2\xa0 And again, some of the people identified or who are targeted today are advisors to President Putin as well as senior figures in the Russian parliament, the Duma.\xc2\xa0 So there are costs individually to them, there are costs to the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0 There are costs to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s eminence on the world stage, if you will, its prestige when it comes to international organizations that make a lot of determinations about a lot of things -- determinations that Russia has earned a right over the years to participate in and to play a role in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">But I think I would point you to the United Nations Security Council vote over the weekend in which Russia was completely alone on the matter of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Thirteen nations voted against Russia.\xc2\xa0 China abstained, notably, and Russia alone cast a single ballot against.\xc2\xa0 So that should tell you something about the costs that these actions have already incurred to Russia.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Malaysian plane, over the weekend the Prime Minister of Malaysia said that evidence existed that would suggest that the plane was deliberately steered off course.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. government know enough whether or not to agree or disagree with that assessment?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are working closely with Malaysian authorities who have the lead in this investigation, and that includes the NTSB, that includes the FAA, and it includes the FBI lending its assistance to the investigation.\xc2\xa0 But we have not seen enough evidence to support any scenario to allow us to draw a conclusion about what happened.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work very closely with a host of international partners, led by the Malaysian government, in the effort to find out what happened to the plane, locate the plane, and find out the cause of its disappearance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So we\'re not prepared to make any assessments about which scenario is most likely until we have more information and more conclusive information.</p>\n<p class="p3">I\xe2\x80\x99ll move around.\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, as has been reported, has the White House abandoned your nominee for surgeon general for the United States?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Murthy is a dynamic, entrepreneurial practitioner who had dedicated a lot of time, energy and passion to health and wellness.\xc2\xa0 As surgeon general, he will be a powerful messenger on these issues in each of the tenets of health:\xc2\xa0 nutrition, activity and resilience.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Murthy, as you know, was approved out of committee with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 But after the confirmation vote of Debo Adegbile, we are recalibrating the strategy around Dr. Murthy\xe2\x80\x99s floor vote.\xc2\xa0 We expect him to get confirmed ultimately and be one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful messengers on health and wellness.</p>\n<p class="p5">So we\'re recalibrating our approach, but in answer to your question, no.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the time, there are reported 10 Senate Democrats who said they will not vote for him because of his opposition of the NRA.\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to these Democrats?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are recalibrating and assessing our strategy moving forward with the nomination in light of the vote that I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Murthy emerged out of committee with a bipartisan vote of support and we will make assessments about how and when to move forward accordingly.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cRecalibrate\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean different nominee.</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jon.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify -- you said to Nedra that you\'re not going to rule out any individual\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions going forward.\xc2\xa0 Are sanctions on Vladimir Putin -- freezing Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s assets -- is that something that is on the table, is actively under consideration if Russia goes further?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to specify where possibilities lie right now except to say that we have an active effort underway to assess what further steps and what further sanctions we can and could impose should the events dictate the need to do that.</p>\n<p class="p5">You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today the actions that we\'ve taken, the individuals that we\'ve identified.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the executive order that widens the net, if you will, and allows for sanctions to be imposed to a broader array -- against a broader array of individuals.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll make assessments accordingly.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not going to get into a game of hinting or indicating who might be next or the steps we might take next except to make clear that should Russia engage in further provocation, should it not avail itself of the opportunity to resolve the situation in Crimea and, more broadly, with Ukraine in a diplomatic and legal way, that there will be more costs and there will be more sanctions.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not taking sanctions against Putin off the table?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve said that already.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not putting on or off any individual.\xc2\xa0 You can see the scope provided by the executive orders that have been signed and how individuals can fall into the categories outlined in those executive orders. But beyond saying that we are assessing regularly additional steps we could take and sanctions we could impose, I\'m not going to label individuals or predict who might be next, if anyone is.</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by taking these actions and saying that they are targeted, those responsible for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activity in Crimea, the White House is not suggesting that Vladimir Putin is not responsible for what Russia has done there?</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Certainly we\'re not.\xc2\xa0 The authorities are --</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not sanction him?\xc2\xa0 I\'m just --</p>\n<p class="p5">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I feel like this is Groundhog Day from a briefing I had last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, now you\xe2\x80\x99ve done this today, and Putin is not on the list, so I\xe2\x80\x99m asking why.</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would suggest that we have identified individuals today.\xc2\xa0 We have the authorities to more broadly identify individuals and entities in the future, and we will do that as necessary if the costs to Russia need to be increased because of Russian actions.</p>\n<p class="p4">What I won\'t do is speculate about who might be on a list of individuals who are sanctioned in the future.\xc2\xa0 I can point you to the list of individuals who have been identified today, and they include obviously advisors to President Putin, as well as senior figures in the Duma.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me ask you just something on -- it was on Russian television, state-controlled television, the main state-controlled channel.\xc2\xa0 Dmitry Kiselyov, a prominent Russian television anchor, posed in front of a mushroom cloud and warned that Russia is the only country in the world capable of turning the U.S. into \xe2\x80\x9cradioactive dust.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I mention this because this is state-controlled Russian television, which, as we know, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t generally broadcast stuff that is not signed off by the government of Russia.\xc2\xa0 What is your sense when you hear something like that?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, that people say crazy things on TV all the time.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but this is Russian state-controlled TV.\xc2\xa0 I take your point entirely, but -- (laughter) -- but this is <span class="s1">\xe2\x80\x93</span></p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the actions of the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the support we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on marshalling a strategy with our partners around the world, especially in Europe, for how to deal with this challenge posed by Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we are making sure that Russia is incurring costs for the provocations it has engaged in and the actions that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now, and those costs are real and they will increase if Russia continues down this path.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Variations on the theme.\xc2\xa0 Is it possible that the United States would sanction the head of state of another nation with which it has normal relations under any circumstances?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about that, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t ruled out any individual who might be covered under the categories that are provided in the executive orders.\xc2\xa0 We have identified individuals today; we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that other individuals can and will be named if Russia continues down the path it\xe2\x80\x99s on.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And President Putin is reputed to have amassed sizeable wealth.\xc2\xa0 Is any of it in the United States?\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. aware that there are assets here which could be targeted?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information of that nature to provide, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I think that we are focused, again, on the sanctions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken today; on the support we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to the Ukrainian government; on the consensus that the United States and our partners have built around the idea that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty must be respected.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work to persuade Russia to pursue a different course here, which is to address its concerns when it comes to ethnic Russians in Ukraine, when it comes to its interests specifically in Crimea, through internationally lawful means that will allow it to ensure that those interests are protected and observed.</p>\n<p class="p4">We have offered, and our European allies have offered, a way out of this for Russia, an off-ramp, that makes clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for Russia to take steps that do not require it to violate a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and will allow it to reduce the cost of this action on Russia.\xc2\xa0 So we hope that, and will work with our partners in trying to bring about Russia availing itself of that option.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, but Russia clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it has violated a sovereign nation\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, together with North Korea and I think Syria, the Syrian regime, they are alone in that belief.</p>\n<p class="p4">Yes.\xc2\xa0 Kristen, sorry.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the issue of military assistance; you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that it\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s under consideration.\xc2\xa0 Is it something that could happen in the next few days, or is it something that\xe2\x80\x99s dependent on further provocations by Putin?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can say that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing requests by the Ukrainian government and military, but our focus continues to be on supporting economic and diplomatic measures to deescalate the situation, not escalate it.\xc2\xa0 In terms of specific requests, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p class="p4">But again, our focus is on steps that Russia can take to deescalate, and that includes returning Russian military troops to their bases and restoring the levels of the Russian military presence in Crimea to those agreed to with the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 Principally, it means <span class="s1">\xe2\x80\x93</span></p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make a decision about this <span class="s1">\xe2\x80\x93</span></p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what further assistance we might provide or actions we might take should Russia continue down its current path.\xc2\xa0 Instead, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that we, in concert with our allies, are providing economic assistance to Ukraine, which is what Ukraine most needs right now, and that we are taking steps to make sure that Russia is paying a price for the action that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken and that Russia understands clearly that that price will rise if they continue down this path.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator John McCain says that sanctioning seven people is a timid response.\xc2\xa0 He said earlier today, \xe2\x80\x9cVladimir Putin must be encouraged by the [absolute] timidity.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Can you react to that?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that these sanctions are going to cause Putin to reverse course and not annex Crimea, which is the goal ultimately at this point?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we have done is named individuals who will be sanctioned because of their actions in support of an effort that defies international law and violates Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has, by signing an additional executive order, created more authorities for more sanctions that can be more broadly applied against individuals, for example, who have very significant influence in Moscow and over the Russian government and Russian leaders, but who themselves do not hold governmental positions.</p>\n<p class="p4">We believe strongly that those costs are real and that they will grow if Russia does not change course.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the path we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 And we think that part of the effort should include action by the Congress to ensure that the United States is providing loan guarantees in the form of bilateral assistance and passing IMF quota reform so that the International Monetary Fund can provide additional assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, in our view, the right course at this time.</p>\n<p class="p4">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I guess, based on all of the reporting that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out of Crimea, it seems like a foregone conclusion that Russia is going to annex Crimea.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that Crimea is now Russia\xe2\x80\x99s?</p>\n<p class="p4">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we do not at all acknowledge or recognize the referendum, and would not under any circumstances.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he think anything can be done to prevent Putin and Russia from moving forward?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Russia will pay a cost if it continues down this path, and the cost will be significant.\xc2\xa0 It has already incurred costs to its economy and to its currency.\xc2\xa0 And the United States will not recognize that sort of action by Russia and nor will most nations across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that is significant when you consider the role that Russia seeks to play internationally.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to ask you one on Malaysia.\xc2\xa0 Apparently, there were only a few FBI officials there who were helping out, and that is in part because, according to a report today in the New York Times, Malaysia has been refusing a larger-scale effort on the part of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on those reports?\xc2\xa0 Are they accurate?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything that the United States is doing or can do to push back against that and provide more assistance with the investigation, particularly whether this was an act of terrorism?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have information on that specific report.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the NTSB, the FAA, and the FBI are all assisting in different ways in this effort.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has obviously provided assets as part of the search effort.\xc2\xa0 I can also say that the Malaysian government has been working very hard to deal with a unique and unusual set of circumstances, and we appreciate that and understand it.\xc2\xa0 And we are working closely with the Malaysian government, and have had and appreciate good cooperation with the Malaysian government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to assist that investigation as that investigation seeks to find out what happened and what caused it.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more insight into that, except to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with the Malaysian government.\xc2\xa0 We have had good cooperation in that effort.\xc2\xa0 And this is obviously a unique and challenging circumstance that everybody is involved in investigating.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, right now you\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that the costs are going to be significant, that the costs are real.\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that the costs are going to be beyond what Russia is willing to pay, beyond the cost of doing business for their foreign policy goal?\xc2\xa0 And also, has the President made any commitments to our allies or to the Russian government that Crimea will never be a part of Russia, at least through this process?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear to Russia -- as have our allies and as have most nations, and as have all the nations that voted in the United Nations Security Council -- that the referendum is not valid; any annexation, as you describe it, would not be valid.\xc2\xa0 It would not be recognized under international law.\xc2\xa0 And such an action would result in more cost to Russia through further isolation and further sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And again, going to the discussion we had earlier, the potential for those costs to be high is real.\xc2\xa0 And the nature of the power structure in Russia is such that these kinds of costs applied to individuals can and will have an impact on that structure, in our view.</p>\n<p class="p3">It\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary for further costs to be incurred if Russia assesses or reassesses the situation and decides to pull back its forces in Crimea, to engage in dialogue with the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 The Ukrainian government has made clear its willingness to accept the presence of international monitors who can assess whether or not the rights of ethnic Russian citizens are in any way being violated.\xc2\xa0 There are other means, lawful means, by which Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests in Crimea and Ukraine can be protected, and that is the path by which Russia can avoid further isolation and sanction.\xc2\xa0 But the costs are real and they will grow if Russia does not change course.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all disheartened that the Russian government seems fully willing to pay the real and significant costs of these sanctions so far?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I mean, that is a snapshot of today.\xc2\xa0 Russia has not changed course, there is no question.\xc2\xa0 But there are costs associated with that.\xc2\xa0 And you can see what has happened to the Russian economy, the Russian markets, the Russian currency.\xc2\xa0 You can imagine the decisions being made by the leaders of multinational corporations and other big and potential investors about the wisdom of investing in a country that flagrantly, using military personnel, violates the territorial integrity of a sovereign nation in violation of the United Nations Charter, in violation of its specific treaty obligations.\xc2\xa0 Those are real consequences.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">So we will pursue a path that continues to encourage Russia to change course, provides a set of steps that will allow Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests to be protected.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to support the Ukrainian government and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to raise the price on Russia for the actions it\xe2\x80\x99s taken if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change course.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">Yes, Ann.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance that -- well, next week when the President goes to the nuclear summit, is it your understanding that President Putin is going to pass up a chance to talk with the other world leaders there?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s sending Foreign Minister Lavrov.\xc2\xa0 And so do you think President Obama would like to have Vladimir Putin come hear from the rest of the world on this next week?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama spoke with President Putin yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been speaking with some regularity with President Putin about the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anyone phrase it that way.\xc2\xa0 I think President Putin understands the position of all the nations that will be participating in that meeting and understands the views of the United States about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s violation of international law.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that next week there will be, while we\xe2\x80\x99re in Europe, a focus on Ukraine in addition to the other business that has to get done there.\xc2\xa0 But I think President Putin understands the actions that are necessary for him to take and for the Russian government to take in order to alleviate some of the cost.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are reports that President Obama will meet with the President of China next week.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on the schedule.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">Chris -- sorry, and then Wendell.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day, a number of beer companies announced they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sponsor parades in New York City and Boston as Mayors Bill de Blasio and Marty Walsh personally boycotted the ones in their own cities because LGBT contingents weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to identify themselves as such during the march.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe those boycotts were the right decision?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about those boycotts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said before, though, that the President opposes discrimination.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that principle apply to these parades here?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President does oppose discrimination, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about boycotts of those parades.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Russia, if the President will impose sanctions on officials because of a military incursion into Ukraine, why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he done the same for the officials responsible for the anti-gay laws in Russia, say by freezing their assets under the Magnitsky Act?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made our views abundantly clear about that kind of legislation and about efforts to undermine the civil rights of Russian citizens.\xc2\xa0 But the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken today and the sanctions that have been announced today are focused on the very real violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, lastly, the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d enabled openly gay people to serve in the U.S. military, but transgender people are still barred because of medical regulation.\xc2\xa0 Last week, an independent commission led by a former surgeon general issued a report saying there was no \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling medical reason\xe2\x80\x9d to prohibit this ban, and called on the Commander-in-Chief to lift it.\xc2\xa0 Will the President direct the Pentagon to lift the ban on transgender service?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to direct you to the Pentagon at this point.</p>\n<p class="p3">Wendell.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In practical terms, Jay, what does it matter to the people of this country if the majority ethnic Russian population of Crimea wants to once again be a part of that country of Russia as they were 50, 60 years ago?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, Wendell, and I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 First of all, what matters here is the principle of territorial integrity and sovereignty under the United Nations Charter and under international law.\xc2\xa0 What matters is the ability of a nation to decide for itself any changes in its territory, its borders, the status of regions within its borders.\xc2\xa0 The implications of accepting Russia\xe2\x80\x99s action, in not sanctioning Russia, in turning a blind eye to it, are profound for every nation, and for every nation that grapples with issues of ethnic minorities or regions that have to define their relationship to the center of the country, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So these are very important issues.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the fact that, and point out the fact that there are means by which individuals in Crimea working with the government in Kyiv can take steps to evaluate and alter their relationship with the central government.\xc2\xa0 But they have to be done in keeping with international law and in keeping with the principles embodied in the constitution of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why it matters and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the referendum itself is not viewed as lawful or legitimate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it our feeling that the referendum itself was fraudulent, i.e. fake votes cast?\xc2\xa0 Or was it the --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked about evidence of that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the way it was set up improper?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, that the way it was conducted violates the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0 And, therefore, whatever its results, it does not and cannot -- it is not being and will not be recognized by the international community.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the conduct of the actual referendum and whether there was fraud, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have further information on that because the event itself was not lawful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, finally, if I could push you once again on Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the U.S. response has been \xe2\x80\x9ctimid,\xe2\x80\x9d is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s contention that, well, as time goes on it will become more powerful?\xc2\xa0 Or is it his contention that it has not been timid to date?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 I have noted that they have fluctuated somewhat in terms of his evaluation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s performance every several days.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on making sure that we support the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people; we rally the international community behind support for the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty; and making sure that we work together so that Russia pays a price for violating Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 All of those things are happening.\xc2\xa0 More costs will be incurred by Russia should it not change its course here.</p>\n<p class="p3">And on the specific matter that was raised when it comes to other forms of assistance, we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating requests and we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating all the ways by which we can provide support to the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 Principally, right now, the support we can supply Ukraine and which Ukraine desperately needs is economic support, working with our international partners and the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with Congress so that Congress gets that done, so that that bilateral assistance can be provided.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p5">We are working with the international community to ensure that our efforts are coordinated so they have the maximum effect, both in terms of the costs that are incurred by Russia and the assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 And, further, we\xe2\x80\x99re working together with our partners to make sure that Russia understands that there is a path out of this confrontation that would allow it to get right with international law and ensure that its interests are acknowledged and assessed.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jared.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay -- just one.\xc2\xa0 You said before that the power structure in Russia is such that these sanctions will really have an effect.\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on what you mean by that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that in Russia there are individuals with a great deal of influence over a course of Russian governmental policy and the economy who do not hold positions in the government, for example.\xc2\xa0 So the authorities provided within the executive order signed today expands the parameters or the categories under which individuals could be targeted for sanctions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no individuals who fill those descriptions who have been targeted as of yet, but the authorities now exist, should those decisions be made.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the sanctions that you imposed there, that the U.S. imposed today -- specifically the, I guess, fact sheet on the sanctions -- specified that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t attack or it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go after any businesses or companies associated with this.\xc2\xa0 Is that possible that that might change in the future?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is true that the sanctions attached to those individually named are targeted at the individuals and their individual wealth and their capacity to get visas and to avail themselves of any property or assets overseas or in the United States, in our case.\xc2\xa0 But there are European sanctions as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">In terms of what further sanctions might be imposed, the answer is it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that further steps could be taken, again, in keeping with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, which is that we will calibrate our response and raise the price, if you will, if Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change course.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the sanctions in place already might make some multinational conglomerates kind of reconsider doing business with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration talking with any of those multinational companies to suggest maybe this might not be --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t attempting to imply that.\xc2\xa0 I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s almost self-evident that that kind of assessment would be ongoing, because investors tend to make assessments about where to put their money based on stability and transparency and rule of law in the countries where they\xe2\x80\x99re investing.\xc2\xa0 And that an action like this and the approbation that Russia has suffered because of it, and the isolation and the sanctions would play into any decisions an investor might make.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that impact felt in the economy and in the stock markets and in the currency, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that it will only get worse for Russia, should they consider down this path.</p>\n<p class="p3">Stephen.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about this expanded authority and say that there are individuals who have got great economic and political influence, are you suggesting that the administration could choose to target oligarchs in Russia in the future?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to the language in the executive order that notes that those -- the authority to impose sanctions against individuals who have influence on those in power in governmental positions but who do not themselves hold positions in the government.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mean the crony provision, right?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Some have described it that way.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that language in the executive order.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought it was in the executive order -- or one of the senior officials mentioned it; kind of pejorative -- you call somebody a crony.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is indeed.\xc2\xa0 It is indeed.</p>\n<p class="p3">Roger.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A bit of a follow-up to Jared\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 You talked about the businesses and stuff like that.\xc2\xa0 Senator Barrasso was one of several in Ukraine over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 He said earlier today that the U.S. should target Russian banks and its petrochemical industry.\xc2\xa0 How would the White House view something like that in that --</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what further steps would be taken should there be further provocations from Russia or a refusal by Russia to change course, except to say that if you look at the breadth of the authorities provided by the executive orders, you can get a sense of what is possible.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about which future targets might exist if further action is taken.</p>\n<p class="p3">All the way in the back.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, any sense -- of those who were named today -- how many of them may have assets in the United States and how much they may have in the United States?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that we would answer questions like that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that we would provide that.</p>\n<p class="p3">George, last one.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, Taoiseach Kenny told Irish reporters that he voiced great concern to President Obama on Friday about the year-long delay in naming an ambassador.\xc2\xa0 Why has it taken so long?\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re taking it as a sign of disinterest on this White House\xe2\x80\x99s part in Dublin.\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on the process of selecting or naming or nominating a new ambassador to Ireland.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President values the relationship we have with the Republic of Ireland and that he has with the Taoiseach of Ireland.\xc2\xa0 But I will assure you that that relationship remains as strong as ever, I think as evidenced by the events of late last week, and that when we have an announcement to make, we will make it.</p>\n<p class="p3">Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p3">END<br/>\n\t2:10 P.M.
