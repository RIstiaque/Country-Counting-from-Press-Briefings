internal reforms in Turkey, including our hope for the reopening of the Halki seminary in Istanbul.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan will almost certainly be on the agenda, and the prospects for progress in normalizing relations between Turkey and Armenia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then it\xe2\x80\x99s on to Istanbul for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit that continues the work of the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship that was hosted by President Obama here in Washington back in April 2010 to promote entrepreneurship, facilitate innovation and private enterprise, and provide greater economic opportunity. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this summit really comes at a critical moment in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that millions of people have been calling out for not only political freedom but also economic opportunity and progress.\xc2\xa0 Entrepreneurs are a driving force in the United States for job creation.\xc2\xa0 They can do the same thing in the Middle East and North Africa, and so this could not be more timely.\xc2\xa0 And this will bring together entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, social entrepreneurship leaders and government officials.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will also be, on the sidelines, an innovation fair for young entrepreneurs, in an event that is sponsored by the Department of State, and the Vice President will go over there as well I believe with Prime Minister Erdogan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That brings us to Athens, after Istanbul, and there the Vice President will continue our very close dialogue and strong cooperation with the government of Greece.\xc2\xa0 As the President said, when he called Prime Minister Papademos on November 21 to congratulate him on his appointment, The United States supports Greece\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to implement its commitments under its EU IMF program.\xc2\xa0 President Obama reiterated that the United States will stand strongly with Greece, a friend and ally, through these difficult times.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is going to show that support and to encourage further implementation of the necessary steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While he\xe2\x80\x99s in Athens, the Vice President is going to hold the administration\xe2\x80\x99s first meeting with Prime Minister Papademos, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll also meet with President Papoulias. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that really covers the highlights of the trip, some of the issues we expect to be discussed.\xc2\xa0 Let me end with that, and turn it over to your questions for me, for Mike, or for Rashad.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, presenters, for information detailed account of the trip.\xc2\xa0 My question, first question, is to National Security Advisor Mr. Tony Blinken.\xc2\xa0 You, sir, I believe, mentioned that one of the items on the agenda is assistance against PKK, which you described as a common enemy.\xc2\xa0 Turkey has been seeking to get recourse from you and as we understand there are some problems with the U.S. Congress.\xc2\xa0 My question is, do you have any news that you will -- to Turkish counterparts on this? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question, on the Entrepreneurship Summit in Istanbul.\xc2\xa0 Again, you had mentioned that one of the forefront issues is going to be regarding the Arab Spring, and I believe there will be attendance from these countries.\xc2\xa0 What specifically -- I mean, how you are thinking to drive, in this summit -- channel this new countries on the path to democracy?\xc2\xa0 Is there any specific mechanism?\xc2\xa0 Are you planning to put -- to help more in these countries?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my final question is on Iran.\xc2\xa0 There was a threat by the air commander -- Air Force commander of the Irani Air Forces over the weekend, saying that in case of an attack by U.S. or Israel on Iran the first target will be the newly installed NATO radar system in Turkey.\xc2\xa0 What is your response to that kind of threat?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 Let me take the first and third questions and have Rashad speak to the summit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, on the PKK question.\xc2\xa0 As I indicated, we stand, in the United States, strongly with our NATO ally, Turkey, in its fight against the PKK.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we sent the U.S. government team to Turkey last October, just after that terrible PKK attack on Turkish soldiers, to discuss additional assistance to the Turkish government in its fight against terrorism. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are a number of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that are assisting Turkey in this fight.\xc2\xa0 And first I should say we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to provide a full range of meaningful and effective support for our ally, Turkey, against PKK terrorism, from national defense to diplomacy, law enforcement, intelligence cooperation.\xc2\xa0 This is something that has to be multifaceted to deal with the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be providing three SuperCobra attack helicopters to Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We transferred four Predator UAVs from Iraq to Incirlik at the air base in Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We -- obviously all U.S. operations in Incirlik occur under agreements with the government of Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also supporting continued cooperation between Iraq and Turkey in combating the PKK, which is a common enemy of Turkey, Iraq and the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We established as you may know with us, Turkey and Iraq a three-way security dialogue to address cross-border terror threats, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to strengthen that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one of the other things we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is we\xe2\x80\x99re working with Europe to clamp down on illegal PKK fundraising and money laundering.\xc2\xa0 So in all of these areas, we are working very closely with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 And this is something as I indicated that the Vice President will talk about when he is in Turkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the question on Iran, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it to Rashad on the summit.\xc2\xa0 A few things I think are worth saying.\xc2\xa0 I think making threatening statements doesn\'t serve anyone\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, least of all the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that the world is deeply concerned with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s activities in a number of areas starting with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that most recently in the very strong resolutions that were adopted by a wide margin at the IAEA following its report on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and also at the U.N. General Assembly on the Iranian assassination plot against the Saudi ambassador in Washington. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turkey shares our goal of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran.\xc2\xa0 And of course, Turkey has a long history of -- ties to Iran as well as a long common border.\xc2\xa0 But Turkish leaders told us repeatedly that they strongly support international efforts to encourage Iran to engage with the P5-plus-1 toward a diplomatic resolution of the concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And of course, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that Turkey, a NATO ally, agreed to host the radar which is a NATO program -- very important to the defense of all NATO countries against the growing missile threat that is emerging in the world, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased that Turkey is standing up as a NATO ally to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rashad, did you want to say something about the summit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HUSSAIN:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We are expecting participants from a number of countries in the Middle East and North Africa including Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen and others.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe that economic and social entrepreneurship are powerful forces for creating opportunity and sparking innovation, also for lifting people out of poverty and helping transform societies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen certainly throughout the Arab Spring that entrepreneurs have been at the forefront of pushing the envelope when it comes to change within societies, and the summit will allow entrepreneurs from all over the world to come together and share their experiences and discuss what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing, some of the ways that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to overcome obstacles that they face to expand their networks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also will continue to promote in this summit and beyond trade, investment, regional integration as we support political and economic reforms in the Middle East and North Africa, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be continuing to assist in combating corruption and aiding those efforts.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will speak a little bit more about this and get into a little bit more detail in some of the specific initiatives that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be implementing with Turkey and with other countries in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much for taking my question.\xc2\xa0 I have actually two questions:\xc2\xa0 Will you expect Excellency the Vice President bring any specific proposal for financial help from the U.S. to Greece, number one?\xc2\xa0 Number two, will you verify that His Excellency will visit the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople and specifically His Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew -- of Constantinople on this coming Saturday, please?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just quickly take the last question, then turn it over to Mike for the first question.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can confirm that he will see the Ecumenical Patriarch when we\xe2\x80\x99re in Turkey, and he very much looks forward to doing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you.\xc2\xa0 I think the U.S. very much recognizes the sacrifices being made by the Greek people as they pursue this reform process and view the fiscal and structural reforms that have been agreed on with the European partners and with the IMF as critical.\xc2\xa0 We stand by Greece.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re a strong friend and ally of Greece, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to support Greece through this very challenging period, including through the IMF where we\xe2\x80\x99re the largest shareholder.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much for doing this.\xc2\xa0 Just to preview -- the administration is clearly supporting Erdogan, even with military assets such as the Predator, although he\xe2\x80\x99s an Islamist.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\'t -- he said he\xe2\x80\x99s conditionally supportive of democracy.\xc2\xa0 He cracks down on political journalists.\xc2\xa0 He supports the bigots in Hamas.\xc2\xa0 So what are you asking in return for giving our support to this local leader?\xc2\xa0 What do we get in return for all this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Turkey has been a longstanding ally to the United States through NATO.\xc2\xa0 We have worked together closely throughout the decade in any theaters of conflict.\xc2\xa0 We have Turkish soldiers in Afghanistan standing side-by-side with our troops.\xc2\xa0 We have Turkish cooperation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Turkey has taken a strong stand against the Asad government in Syria, and the Prime Minister has called on Asad to step down.\xc2\xa0 Turkey is implementing Arab League sanctions.\xc2\xa0 It played a very significant role in Libya in terms of supporting forces for progress there.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing similar things in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So in many, many areas, as well by the way, as trade and economic ties, which have I think have increased twofold since President Obama has been in office.\xc2\xa0 So in many, many areas we\xe2\x80\x99re working very, very closely with Turkey.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Turkey has a very important story to tell as a country that can send -- set an example for other countries that are making transitions in the Arab world, in the Islamic world, in North Africa.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are areas where we clearly have disagreements with our ally and partner, and we have the kind of mature relationship which we can make those disagreements known. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned some areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve had disagreements, and when it comes to making our concerns known that\'s certainly something we\xe2\x80\x99ve done and continue to do.\xc2\xa0 Right now for example Turkey is looking at revising its constitution, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging the Turks in this constitutional reform process to have an inclusive process that strengthens freedoms of expression, religion and other fundamental rights, including the human rights of minorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed concerns about journalists who\xe2\x80\x99ve been detained and others.\xc2\xa0 We have pushed very hard and continue to push for the reopening of the Halki seminary, and that\'s something that will come up certainly on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 So we have the kind of relationship with Turkey where we work very closely together on so many different issues across the globe, but where when we have disagreements we make them known in a spirit of respect.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Hi, Tony.\xc2\xa0 First of all, for you, you said the Vice President will meet with the President and the Prime Minister of Greece.\xc2\xa0 But you know we have a coalition government, which is being supported by three parties -- with George Papandreou, Mr. Samaras and the leader of the far right, Mr. Karatzaferis.\xc2\xa0 And then, Mr. Froman, you mentioned the support that the U.S. gives in the IMF and generally.\xc2\xa0 But will there be something more from the Vice President since that\'s the first visit by such a high U.S. official in Greece after the crisis?\xc2\xa0 Will there be something on investment, something maybe in the role of the U.S. banks in dealing with lowering the Greek debt?\xc2\xa0 I mean something more specific in terms of -- support?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 On the first question, yes, the Vice President will meet with the heads of the two principal parties supporting the transition government, former Prime Minister Papandreou, who heads the largest party in parliament, as you know, and Antonio Samaras, who heads the second largest party.\xc2\xa0 So he will meet with both of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 On the economic situation, the Vice President will be supportive of the overall reform effort and the package of measures that have been put in place by the European partners and by the IMF.\xc2\xa0 That includes substantial funding, as well as other mechanisms to help support Greece during the transition period.\xc2\xa0 So his support will be for the existing package of reform measures and of financial support that\'s been provided to Greece.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for taking the call.\xc2\xa0 Can you hear me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, please.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the issue of relations between Turkey and Israel to come up?\xc2\xa0 On trade with Turkey, could you talk a little bit more specifically about what you expect to do in that space?\xc2\xa0 And overall, how would you characterize the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s mission here?\xc2\xa0 Is it part of the continuation of an ongoing dialogue?\xc2\xa0 Or do you see concrete deliverables from his visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 It really is part of a continuum.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had deep engagement with Turkey and with Greece by the President and by the Vice President since the start of this administration and indeed by both of them before they came to the White House and so this is very much part of a continuum in that relationship.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I said at the outset, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of an international issue where we don\'t have close cooperation or collaboration or consultation at the very least with Turkey, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot on the agenda right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I should add that really the focal point of this trip is the Entrepreneurship Summit, and that\'s the primary reason that the Vice President is making this trip.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that\'s very important to President Obama who initiated the summit here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We see this, as Rashad said, as a very important vehicle for supporting entrepreneurship around the world, but also particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, and at a very critical time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And of course, in Greece we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to show our ongoing support for Greece, for a close friend and partner as it goes through a difficult time. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Turkey and Israel, yes, I suspect that that will come up.\xc2\xa0 We have in the United States longstanding strategic ties with both Israel and with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 We have been and we continue to encourage both countries to seek opportunities to move beyond the recent strains in their relationship, and we believe that opportunities are there for the two countries to fully repair relations and move forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It pains us to see the two of them at odds because they\'re both such close partners of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the bottom line is that improved relations between Turkey and Israel would be good for Turkey, good for Israel and good for the United States and indeed good for the region and the world so that\'s something we will continue to encourage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, did you have anything to add?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99d only add that Turkey is one of the better performing, faster growing economies of the world at the moment.\xc2\xa0 We are close partners in the G20, and they play a critical role in the G20.\xc2\xa0 And through that and other mechanisms, we engage in a whole range of economic, trade and investment issues.\xc2\xa0 And as Tony said, this is part of our ongoing dialogue with them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you would just address this narrative that you see so much in the press that Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s government is Islamist and looking east rather than to its old friends and NATO to the west and sort of spinning out of our sphere of influence and towards Iran and some of the other regimes in the neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 You know that this sort of narrative is out there.\xc2\xa0 I wonder -- I gather from your comments you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a more nuanced story to tell.\xc2\xa0 Could you address that narrative in particular?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that Turkey has always looked to the east and the west, given its position in the world both geographically and geopolitically just as I might add the United States looks both to the Pacific and to the Atlantic.\xc2\xa0 In that sense, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite similar.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turkey has been, remains and will be an important member of the transatlantic alliance of NATO.\xc2\xa0 That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very much anchored in NATO. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turkey has expanded its involvement in the Middle East through increased political engagement, trade, social and cultural relations.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, it remains deeply engaged with the United States and our European allies.\xc2\xa0 And of course, it continues to seek accession to the European Union.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think these things are in conflict at all or in contradiction.\xc2\xa0 To the contrary, I think they complement each other. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turkey has in many ways a unique role to play as a bridge between these different worlds, an ability to talk to different countries in ways that are extremely helpful.\xc2\xa0 And as I suggested earlier, its own example can be very powerful to countries now going through transition.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s very encouraging to see Turkey play a strong leadership role.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Libya.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in Egypt, in Afghanistan, in NATO.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that is in the interest of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. BARKOFF:\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks, all, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. BLINKEN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 3:29 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
