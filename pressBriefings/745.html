Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:56 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things I want to bring to your attention before I take your questions.</p>\n<p>First of all, you should have seen moments ago a statement from the President on the House passage of the Violence Against Women Act.\xc2\xa0 The President says in this statement:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was pleased to see the House of Representatives come together and vote to reauthorize and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act.\xc2\xa0 Over more than two decades, this law has saved countless lives and transformed the way we treat victims of abuse.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s vote will go even further by continuing to reduce domestic violence, improving how we treat victims of rape, and extending protections to Native American women and members of the LGBT community.</p>\n<p>The bill also reauthorizes the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, providing critical support for both international and domestic victims of trafficking, and helping ensure traffickers are brought to justice.</p>\n<p>I want to thank leaders from both parties, especially Leader Pelosi, Congresswomen Gwen Moore and Senator Leahy, for everything they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to make this happen.\xc2\xa0 Renewing this bill was an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear.\xc2\xa0 And I look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I would note that the vote in the House was bipartisan, substantially.\xc2\xa0 It was 286 to 138.\xc2\xa0 That included 199 Democratic yes votes, 0 Democratic no votes; 87 Republican yes votes, 138 Republican no votes.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention the Republican bill in the Senate that supposedly would provide flexibility on how to deal with or implement the sequester.\xc2\xa0 We have put out a statement of administration policy on this, and I think you will note that we believe no amount of flexibility changes the fact that these severe cuts threaten thousands of middle-class jobs and slash vital services for children, seniors and our troops and military families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is no way to cut spending this dramatically over a seven-month period without drastically affecting national security and economic priorities.\xc2\xa0 The Republican proposal is the worst of all worlds.\xc2\xa0 It explicitly protects pork-barrel projects and every single tax loophole that benefits the wealthy, but puts on the table cuts to things like Medicare and education, forcing middle-class families to bear the burden while asking nothing from the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem; it makes the problem worse.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This bill is an effort to shift the focus away from the need for the Congress to work toward a bipartisan compromise that would avoid sequestration.\xc2\xa0 The Congress must act responsibly to avert sequestration through balanced deficit reduction, and stop endangering the nation\'s economic recovery.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With that, I\'ll go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 This meeting with congressional leaders tomorrow, is this a meeting to focus solely on dealing with the sequester?\xc2\xa0 Or does the focus turn now to a bigger deal to deal with the spending cuts, but also some of these other deadlines with the CR and with debt ceiling issues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a very good question, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two things I would say.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the Senate will vote on the proposal put forward by Democrats that would deal with the sequester, postpone the sequester in a balanced, responsible way.\xc2\xa0 We expect that that bill will get majority support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The only reason why it might not pass the Senate is because a minority of Republicans, led by the Republican leader, would filibuster that bill -- a pretty stark indication of the state of things when a bill that has majority support is blocked by a minority, when that bill would avert the problem that we have confronting us with this imminent deadline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\'ll have to see what the Senate actually does, whether Republicans filibuster this bill.\xc2\xa0 That has not happened yet.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they\'ll have a change of heart.\xc2\xa0 And that will obviously affect the topics of conversation tomorrow in the meeting with the President.</p>\n<p>The President believes we need to come together and deal with the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And the sequester is just one piece of the broader challenge here, which is reducing our deficit in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the sequester was part of when it was included in the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 And it was designed as policy that would never come into effect because it was so onerous for both sides.\xc2\xa0 It would compel Congress to reach a compromise that reduced our deficit by a further $1.2 trillion.</p>\n<p>The President, as you know, has put forward a proposal that is balanced, that works on -- that continues the progress that we\'ve made in deficit reduction, $2.5 trillion thus far, more than two dollars in spending cuts for every dollar in revenue represented in that $2.5 trillion of deficit reduction -- the kind of balance that tilts toward spending cuts that this President has put on the table, the kind of balance that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen, unfortunately, from Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he hopes that -- whether it is action by Republicans to deal with the sequester in the short term in a balanced way, or to take up the project of a bigger deal and more deficit reduction that helps us reach that $4 trillion goal, he will be hoping that Republicans, whether it\'s the short term or the long term, are ready to talk seriously about compromise and making sure that Washington is not inflicting wounds on the economy right when the economy should be growing and creating jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is there anything that\'s off the table for tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Were there any preconditions from either the President or from Republicans in terms of taxes or things that are not to be part of what\'s asked for tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, there are no preconditions to a meeting like this.\xc2\xa0 This is a meeting with the President and leaders of Congress, both parties.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, any topic is up for discussion if one member of the group decides he or she wants to broach it.\xc2\xa0 The immediate purpose of the meeting is to talk about the imminent sequester deadline and the need to avert it -- the need, if it is implemented, to take action in a balanced way to deal with our deficit reduction in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t unduly burden seniors, or middle-class families, or parents of children with disabilities, that asks everyone to bear the burden, and that by doing that, allows our economy to continue to grow, to continue the recovery that we\'ve seen underway now for three years, but that still has a long way to go.</p>\n<p>So the President is firm in his conviction that we need to include balance in our deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It is unacceptable, it is a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway\xe2\x80\x9d approach to say that revenues shouldn\'t be part of it -- because as it\'s true of the proposal Republicans in the Senate are putting forward today, what\'s true about that proposal is true with the general Republican position, which is that they would rather see sequester take effect with its job loss, with its negative effect on economic growth, than ask a single wealthy individual to pay a little bit more, to give up a special tax break, to ask some big corporations or industries to forego their loopholes or limit their deductions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just not a position that is sustainable, we believe, and it\'s not fair to the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, today is the deadline for the administration to file an amicus brief if it chooses to do so in the Prop 8 case before the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Will the administration be filing a brief in that case?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I\'ve said in the past, decisions about filing briefs are legal and constitutional matters, so best to address those questions to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to what you were saying earlier, why is the President so concerned about closing loopholes now when six weeks ago as part of the fiscal cliff deal, he was very interested in agreeing to sign into law loopholes that protected certain industries like the wind industry and NASCAR and films?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, as part of the end-of-the-year negotiations, we were focused, as were the Republicans, on the imminent prospect of taxes going up on middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that had to be resolved and was resolved.\xc2\xa0 We were also focused on the need to return the top marginal rate to the level it was under President Clinton, 39.6, for the wealthiest Americans, and that was achieved.\xc2\xa0 And that produces now in the 10-year window a certain amount of revenue toward deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously a positive development.</p>\n<p>The fact is the loopholes that we have identified are similar to some of the ones that John Boehner, the Speaker of the House, has identified as worthy of closing, as not good for our tax code, not good for economic fairness.\xc2\xa0 And those are the ones we believe should be closed.</p>\n<p>And additionally, in our proposal to the Speaker of the House we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a provision that would cap deductions at 28 percent for millionaires and billionaires -- that would produce a certain amount of revenue -- and the combination would achieve the level necessary of revenue as part of an overall deficit-reduction package that includes savings from entitlements that would complete the job of getting $4 trillion-plus in deficit reduction over 10 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that proposal that the President made to Speaker Boehner, which everyone here I think, or most people here recognized as an effort by the President to compromise, to make tough choices for Democrats, is still on the table.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that the Speaker would consider taking up that proposal, because just -- I think it was yesterday or the day before -- the Speaker talked about how he believes we could and should reform the tax code.\xc2\xa0 The fundamental difference here now seems to be not that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t close loopholes and cap deductions for the wealthiest individuals and corporations that are given special treatment in the tax code -- the Speaker seems to agree with that.\xc2\xa0 The disagreement here now seems to be that he believes that the savings from that action, the savings from closing those loopholes, should be funneled back to the wealthiest individuals in tax cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We believe adopting a conservative position that that savings should be applied to deficit reduction, and thereby by applying that savings to deficit reduction we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking seniors and middle-class families to bear the burden of deficit reduction all by themselves -- and that\'s a pretty conservative position.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty reasonable, middle-of-the-road, common-sense approach to both tax reform and entitlement reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the specific issue of tax loopholes and allowing -- or agreeing to continue some but now saying these other ones are bad, is there any contradiction that you have to square your messaging on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me is the wind energy tax credit that helps support thousands of jobs and, importantly, contributes to the development and growth of clean energy technologies in this country, so the jobs in those industries are created in this country, I would say absolutely yes.\xc2\xa0 And a number of Republicans agree with us.</p>\n<p>If you ask me if an industry -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about clean energy, energy jobs of the future -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking if subsidies that have been in effect for 100 years for the oil and gas industry, taxpayer subsidies given to an industry that is doing quite well, as everyone here who has filled up their tank recently can attest, whether those subsidies and special tax breaks should be continued, the answer is no.\xc2\xa0 They\'re bad policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s something that actually Ronald Reagan agrees with.\xc2\xa0 He said numerous times he had proposed to close that special tax break and loophole for the oil and gas industry back in 1985 when he thought at the time that the need for that subsidization of the oil and gas industry had run its course.\xc2\xa0 And that was almost 30 years ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on Syria briefly, is the U.S. government helping in any way to train Syrian opposition rebels?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw Secretary Kerry announce an increase in our assistance to the opposition, the Syrian Opposition Coalition, in Rome today.\xc2\xa0 He stood with our partners in that coalition and reaffirmed the commitment of President Obama to help the Syrian people transition to a Democratic inclusive and peaceful Syria.</p>\n<p>Bashar al-Assad has lost all legitimacy and must go.\xc2\xa0 We stand united with the Syrian people on this, and we will continue to offer support to the Syrian opposition even as other countries choose to make it possible for Assad to continue his violent campaign against his own people.</p>\n<p>Secretary Kerry announced today that to translate our support into tangible assistance, we will provide an additional $60 million in nonlethal support to the Coalition\xe2\x80\x99s operational needs.\xc2\xa0 That comes on top of $50 million already provided in nonlethal assistance to the opposition, and is separate from the $385 million in humanitarian assistance that we have been providing to the Syrian population.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to sequester in a minute.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if the President took note yesterday at all of the oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the Voting Rights Act, if he was briefed on it, has any particular reaction to it.\xc2\xa0 It could be described in many ways, but lively would be one way to describe it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken with him about it.\xc2\xa0 I know that White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler was in attendance, but I have not spoken with the President so I don\'t have a reaction from him on those arguments.\xc2\xa0 I will say that while I can\'t comment on specific litigation -- and for comment on that, I would refer you to the Department of Justice -- I can say that it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position and the White House position that voting is a basic democratic right.\xc2\xa0 And the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act itself passed with bipartisan support in Congress and was signed into law by President Bush just seven years ago.</p>\n<p>The protections offered in the Voting Rights Act have been critical to reducing discrimination in voting in the more than four decades since the law was first passed, and continue to play an important role.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must remain vigilant in guaranteeing access to the ballot box.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the sequester issues, when will the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget be sent to the Congress, and why is it so far behind schedule?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this question in the past.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a date --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s word of a new delay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m bringing it up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a date certain.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided a date certain for when the budget will be put forward, but I think it will be in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is sequester complicating it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the series of manufactured crises around budget issues certainly has resulted at least in part in those experts in the administration who work on those issues being -- having to spend a lot of time dealing with those crises rather than on that.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the job, and they\xe2\x80\x99re working on the budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Education Secretary was here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He said some things that didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove to be true about the immediacy of pink slips for teachers.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned a specific school district in West Virginia.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not sequester-related at all.\xc2\xa0 He made some sort of mild -- suggested that they might not be.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re clearly not.\xc2\xa0 How confident are you, Jay, and confident is this administration that the things it\xe2\x80\x99s saying and the portrait it is presenting to the country is not only accurate but will stand the scrutiny of time once these cuts begin?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that there was a note of exaggeration or factual inaccuracy.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, really?\xc2\xa0 Because if you want to provide other examples, I\xe2\x80\x99d take them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The FAA can\xe2\x80\x99t explain definitively there will be 90-minute delays.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another example.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the Secretary of Transportation was giving you an absolute minute target for how much the delays will be.\xc2\xa0 If there are going to be delays as a result of reduction in man-hours and personnel among our air traffic controllers, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And I hope you keep that in mind when you\xe2\x80\x99re on your next commercial flight and you\xe2\x80\x99re delayed, if that does in fact come into effect with the sequester.</p>\n<p>I would refer you to the Department of Education and to the superintendent of schools in the district that you mentioned for specifics about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not familiar with it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the impacts of sequester are real, and to diminish them --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re familiar with that example -- it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 That was wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m unfamiliar of the example.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Education and to the superintendent of the school district for more information about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it came from your podium, right?\xc2\xa0 You guys said that.\xc2\xa0 You guys made the statement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was in this room, and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I am not personally in contact with individual school districts --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re asserting something and you\xe2\x80\x99re asking us to check with a local school affiliate on whether or not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, Hans.\xc2\xa0 Let me rewind the tape where I said I would refer you to the Department of Education, which is here in Washington, D.C., not a local school district, for more information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also referred us to the district.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the school district is a good place to go for information about the school district.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they said the information said at that podium was false, it was wrong.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to acknowledge that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more for you in it.\xc2\xa0 I welcome -- I encourage you to make phone calls in the old-fashioned reporting sense to find out more if you like.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on it.</p>\n<p>The fact is the effects of sequester will be real if it takes place, beginning tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 In Ohio -- Ohio will lose approximately $25.1 million in funding for primary and secondary education, putting around 350 teacher and aide jobs at risk.\xc2\xa0 In addition, about 34,000 fewer students would be served, and approximately 100 fewer schools would receive funding.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s real -- if this happens, you should go out to Ohio and ask the families that are affected if they think it\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>California will lose about $3.3 million in funding for jobs search assistance, referral, and placement -- meaning around 129,770 fewer people will get the help and skills they need to find employment.\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the effects of sequester are real, if sequester takes place, after a few weeks, fly to California, go to a jobs assistance placement office, find the people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting served, and ask them if they think it\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ask the family whose child will not have a slot in Head Start whether they think it\xe2\x80\x99s real.\xc2\xa0 Ask the civilian Defense Department employee, who\xe2\x80\x99s already gotten a notification that he or she will --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But even the President has said that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, let me finish -- that he or she will be furloughed, whether that has a real impact.\xc2\xa0 They might lose 10 or 20 percent of their pay for the month or the year -- whether that has a real impact on their family budget.\xc2\xa0 I think to suggest otherwise is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No one in this room suggested otherwise.\xc2\xa0 I asked you about what the Education Secretary said --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying for more information about that you should go to the Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is you\xe2\x80\x99re using an example -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details on it -- to suggest that the whole argument --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked you about it.\xc2\xa0 I just asked you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, again, let\xe2\x80\x99s rewind the tape, because what you said after that was, do you think -- using this as an example -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re exaggerating the effects of sequester.\xc2\xa0 And I just gave you concrete examples of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Those are real people with real impacts.\xc2\xa0 And I think they wonder, when they sit around their kitchen tables, why Washington can\xe2\x80\x99t compromise, and in this case, because compromise represents willingness to accept policies that aren\xe2\x80\x99t 100 percent of what you want.\xc2\xa0 The President has done that again and again. Unfortunately, Republicans seem to be unwilling to do that when it comes to sequester, so the sequester may take place with the effects that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even the President said last night, economists say this is not a cliff, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tumble downward.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s conceivable in the first few weeks, the first month, that a lot of people may not notice the full impact of the sequester.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned that you\xe2\x80\x99ve overstated the impact of it initially and he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to dial it back?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our responsibility to be upfront about the fact that you cannot responsibly cut $85 billion out of the budget in seven months without having -- in the way that the law is designed without having dramatic effects on the defense industry and civilian workers, on our national security readiness, on teachers, on kids in Head Start.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a markedly different tone from the tone that, for example, was in what the Attorney General said when he says, this is going to have an impact on the safety of this country, and anyone who says otherwise is lying.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that\'s -- if you reduce the number of border security guards, that has an impact on our safety.\xc2\xa0 If you are forced because of the sequester to change our military readiness posture, that has an effect on our safety.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the reporters are the ones who are suggesting that we -- that all of this was going to happen the stroke after midnight when the sequester goes into effect.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve never said that.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve always been clear about when you talk about -- furloughs, notices go out; once you receive a notice there\xe2\x80\x99s always a 30-day warning before the furloughs actually begin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'ve been very clear about the different impacts.\xc2\xa0 When Arne Duncan was here yesterday, Secretary of Education, he made clear that a lot of the actual effects in the education world won\'t be felt concretely until the fall because that\'s when the new school year begins.\xc2\xa0 There are some specific areas like school districts outside of military bases or on Indian reservations that will feel the impact immediately because they\xe2\x80\x99ll be forced by the nature of their grants to cut their budgets for this school year.</p>\n<p>We\'ve been very clear.\xc2\xa0 What the President said last night is -- and I think what other people have said -- is that this will be a rolling impact, an effect that will build and build and build.\xc2\xa0 And as the CBO has said, and as outside economic organizations have said, we\'ll see a contraction in the amount of GDP growth -- reduction in the amount of GDP growth by a full half of a percent or more.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll see up to 750,000 jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the CBO.\xc2\xa0 That\'s Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and Macroeconomics Advisors.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s real.\xc2\xa0 At least we agree with those assessments.\xc2\xa0 And it affects real people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different topic, at last year\xe2\x80\x99s White House Correspondents Dinner, the President said he values a free press that is not afraid to ask questions, to examine and to criticize. Has he ever spoken to his aides about the tone he\xe2\x80\x99d like them to take, you all to take, when talking to the press?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President expects us to fully explain his policies, to answer questions about his positions, and to make clear when we believe factual errors are being stated, which is what we do.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think as anyone who has done this from either side of this podium can tell you, these are about real issues.\xc2\xa0 These are about the concrete effects of policy on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, on our national security, on our children\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 And everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s involved in these issues feels passionately about them.\xc2\xa0 But we are enormously respectful of the work that you do, that I used to do, and we also believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to make clear when we think, as we have in the past, somebody is out there getting the facts wrong.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when Gene Sperling told Bob Woodward that he might regret his reporting, what was intended by that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, don\'t you think it would be a responsible thing to ask that question in the context of the full email since we know what the full email said, where Gene Sperling, in keeping with a demeanor I have been familiar with for more than 20 years, was incredibly respectful, referred to Mr. Woodward as his friend, and apologized for raising his voice? I think you cannot read those emails and come away with the impression that Gene was threatening anybody, as I think others have observed.</p>\n<p>The point, though -- I wish that reporters would pay attention to the policy substance of that email because the point that Gene was making is a point that I\'ve made and others have made and the President has made.\xc2\xa0 This is really important policy, and one thing that is absolutely irrefutable is that the President, from day one of signing the Budget Control Act, has been absolutely clear that in dealing with deficit reduction going forward and in replacing and eliminating the sequester, he believed we had to have balance.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to have your head in the sand not to know that.\xc2\xa0 Everybody here has reported it ad nauseam.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s the fact that Gene was concerned with.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the fact that we\'re all concerned with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll stop after this, I promise.\xc2\xa0 But as you\xe2\x80\x99ve remarked, you\'re in a unique position because you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on both sides of a reporter-source relationship.\xc2\xa0 Any regret about the erosion of trust between sources and reporters?\xc2\xa0 Does it hurt the public?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that I\'ve seen this play out before in both White Houses I\'ve covered previously.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve talked about this just in recent weeks where the naturally adversarial relationship between the press corps and any administration, any White House, means that you guys, appropriately, are always demanding more information and holding our feet to the fire.\xc2\xa0 That\'s absolutely how it should be.\xc2\xa0 You go out and you report everything you can find about what we\'re doing and what Congress is doing and what the agencies are doing. And we get out there and try to explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s positions and articulate why we think his positions are the right positions, and contest assertions to the contrary.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x98Twas ever thus.\xc2\xa0 And it was certainly that way when I got here and covered the Clinton White House, and when I was covering the Bush White House.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s any different now. In fact, I would suggest that the atmosphere in this room was a lot more tense when I got here in 1993 than it is today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you were just telling Jessica that the tone of that email from Gene Sperling was respectful -- last night on Twitter, David Plouffe, who very recently was a very senior advisor inside this White House, put out a tweet that was basically comparing Bob Woodward to an aging baseball player who has sort of lost his talent, and sort of belittled him.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\'s respectful?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House also supports?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the fact of the matter is there was an accusation that Gene had been threatening.\xc2\xa0 And as I think everybody who knows Gene knows, that\'s hard to believe.\xc2\xa0 So, one. Two, Gene has been working on these issues all his life.\xc2\xa0 He is very passionate about them.\xc2\xa0 He works 20 hours a day, often, on behalf of the American people and this President to try to advance an economic agenda that helps middle-class Americans, average Americans.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Look, I have enormous respect for the work that Bob Woodward is famous for.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of us probably got into the business in part because we read \xe2\x80\x9cAll The President\xe2\x80\x99s Men\xe2\x80\x9d or we saw the movie, or both.\xc2\xa0 But we had a factual disagreement that I think we stand by, which is that the President was very clear from the beginning that he would push balanced deficit reduction. I mean, how can that be a mystery?\xc2\xa0 That\'s been his position since the day he signed the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0 It was even the position that various Republicans adopted in trying to eliminate the sequester.\xc2\xa0 So the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cmoving the goalposts\xe2\x80\x9d is not one we agree with.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s it, really.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a disagreement about the facts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so we\'re concerned about the facts in this debate about the sequester.\xc2\xa0 In the back-and-forth just here about Arne Duncan, are you acknowledging from this podium now, though, that some of the things he said yesterday were not true?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\'t independently looked into them, so I can\'t really --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can the public believe what you\'re saying day in, day out, about flight towers and everything else if you\'re not checking it out?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I had the Secretary of Transportation come up here and talk about the impacts on the FAA, the Secretary of Education talk about the impacts on areas of his budget.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s because they\xe2\x80\x99re the experts in those fields.\xc2\xa0 And I had the Secretary of Homeland Security talk about the effects on her areas of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 So we do that because they know the most and the most in depth about those areas.\xc2\xa0 So when you want an answer to a specific question I think you ought to take it to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the broader point, setting aside that issue, was I think strongly made, which is that there will be substantial effects on school districts around the country, on budgets to help poor children and budgets to help disabled kids, which are, as Secretary Duncan described, two of the biggest portions of his budget and that will unavoidably be affected when sequester is implemented.</p>\n<p>So, again, those are real people out there who will suffer if sequester goes into effect and stays into effect for a substantial period of time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a specific, substantive point, yesterday when you were asked about the ICE Agency releasing detainees apparently because of budget cuts around sequester, you had said that the White House did not intervene beforehand.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting overnight that perhaps ICE is rethinking this, and I wonder has the White House since yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing intervened with ICE and said this is not a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was a decision made by career officials at ICE without any input from the White House as a result of fiscal uncertainty over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration.\xc2\xa0 I have no more information today about it than I did yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing on -- when you were talking about the relationship with press -- today Secretary Lew was just sworn in as the Treasury Secretary.\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t let cameras or the press pool in.\xc2\xa0 Why not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was a private ceremony with members of his family, including grandchildren.\xc2\xa0 As you know, now Secretary Lew has served President Obama in four positions -- this is his fourth.\xc2\xa0 And he and the President have become close through their service together and the President wanted to have this ceremony for Secretary Lew in the Oval Office because of that relationship.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, just the last thing on that, though.\xc2\xa0 The AP reported in January of 2009 that the last Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, who I assume had his family there as well, was sworn in by the Vice President and the President was there, and actually made remarks about the financial crisis and said that we need to get our team in place.\xc2\xa0 Right now there\xe2\x80\x99s a budget crisis that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about from this podium every day.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President open it up to TV cameras and say --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it was a ceremony, Ed, a family ceremony.\xc2\xa0 The President has addressed the looming sequester challenge as recently as last night.\xc2\xa0 He took questions on it from you guys less than a week ago on Friday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking with you about it in the future and making remarks about it in the future.\xc2\xa0 Granted it\xe2\x80\x99s not as important as who he\xe2\x80\x99s playing golf with, but he will be talking about this very important policy issue and engaging with you on it in the future.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be forced to cut security guards and that\xe2\x80\x99s because of the nature of the sequester -- it forces you to go down to the deepest level of government activity and then make the across-the-board cuts.\xc2\xa0 Why not accept flexibility so you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said at the top, no amount of flexibility changes the fact that these severe cuts threaten thousands of middle-class jobs and slash vital services for children, seniors, and our troops and military families.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t -- $85 billion, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve had economic officials talk to you about and Cabinet Secretaries talk to you about -- there is no way to mitigate the damage that cuts made that deeply and that swiftly in the budgets identified go away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it wouldn\'t have cut security guards.\xc2\xa0 It would force you to make a choice.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you were here when Homeland Security Secretary Napolitano was here and explained how that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xc2\xa0 And in these personnel-intensive agencies when you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to deal with the kinds of cuts envisioned here, you have to apply them to personnel through furloughs and the like, or reduce man-hours.</p>\n<p>You cannot -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem.\xc2\xa0 The Fed Chairman made clear that no changing of the nature of the $85 billion in cuts would change the effect on the economy, which he described as negative, in talking about the effect on our fiscal situation.</p>\n<p>The best way to go about this is to postpone the sequester or agree to a bigger deal that eliminates it entirely in a balanced way -- in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ask seniors, or the border security guards, or middle-class families who depend on important services for disabled kids or help sending their kids to college -- if you ask them to bear the burden of this deficit reduction, the burden is onerous.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you spread out the burden and ask wealthy individuals, who enjoy advantages in the tax code that average Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t, to give up those advantages, if you ask industries and corporations that have special exceptions written into the tax code because they have really good lobbyists here in Washington to give up those special exceptions and exemptions, you can spread the burden and make it less onerous on regular folks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the President believes is the right way to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one question about Arne Duncan.\xc2\xa0 Wait, can I just finish with one last question about Arne Duncan?\xc2\xa0 Are you in essence saying that one inaccurate example should not undercut your larger argument about the overall --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics about this example, but I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly saying that the larger argument remains true.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s irrefutable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been attested to by Republicans who, until they changed their political strategy, were shouting from the rooftops about the terrible effects of sequester.\xc2\xa0 You guys reported on it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking for some forbearance on the specific examples.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics so I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for forbearance.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the specifics.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 I know you want to leave questions about the Prop 8 brief to the DOJ, but as the President\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman, I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about his deliberations on this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on it.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has expressed an opinion in the past on this issue as a matter of policy.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to legal and constitutional issues around it, that\xe2\x80\x99s a jurisdiction that resides at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A decision about whether to weigh in wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a policy decision made by the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on it.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the DOJ.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just the bottom line on these questions about the sequester.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be like tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this thing is going to happen barring a legislative miracle.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen tomorrow, so what are we going to see?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it will happen Saturday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it will happen tomorrow at 11:59 p.m.\xc2\xa0 So what happens at 11:59 p.m. tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about various areas where these cuts once implemented will go into effect and the impacts they will have.\xc2\xa0 Not all of them will be felt immediately, as I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about -- Secretary Duncan, the President, others -- but there will be immediate effects.\xc2\xa0 And if you doubt that, how do you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- immediate effects --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, let\'s talk about GDP, which was, granted, revised upwards two-tenths of a percent for the fourth quarter.\xc2\xa0 But it was as low a figure as we got, as every outside economist will tell you, because of the reduction -- in part because of the reduction in defense spending -- a historic 40-year low or drop -- in anticipation of the sequester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We saw it again yesterday, I believe it was, in the durable goods figures that showed almost all of the drop in durable goods attributable to defense sector reductions in spending, reductions and orders made by defense industry companies because of sequester.\xc2\xa0 These have real effects on business and on jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we will see it when -- we\'ve seen it already from the notices that have gone out warning people that furlough notices will be forthcoming if sequester goes into effect.</p>\n<p>Now, I believe that if you\'re a middle-class family and the father or mother in that family gets a notice in a couple of days, or has gotten a notice already, that he or she will be getting a furlough notice and that that furlough will take effect in 30 days, that doesn\'t have an impact on your family in 30 days.\xc2\xa0 It has an impact on your family right now, as you begin to contemplate life with less money to make the ends meet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s just -- these are real consequences.\xc2\xa0 There will be families that get notices that there\'s not a slot anymore for their child in Head Start.\xc2\xa0 And there will be families that have to deal with reduced hours if a father or mother is a border security guard or an air traffic controller.\xc2\xa0 These are real-world impacts.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t all happen on Saturday; it\'s a gradual process.\xc2\xa0 But the cumulative impact of sequester will be significant to our economy and particularly so to the individuals affected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you say to Mayor Bloomberg, who stood right over there yesterday and was asked about the warnings that have come out of the White House, and he said there\'s a lot of posturing.\xc2\xa0 "Spare me, I live in that world.\xc2\xa0 I mean, come on, let\'s get serious here."\xc2\xa0 He was very dismissive of these warnings.\xc2\xa0 Is Mayor Bloomberg just wrong about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\'t there.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what he had to say.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he said.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Different cities and regions and states will have different effects, depending on what kind of funding they get in the affected areas from the federal government.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to what the impacts will be on New York City.\xc2\xa0 But there will be real-world impacts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is I think just a fact that if you\'re at the receiving end of a notice that you\'re going to be furloughed or you\'re going to be laid off, that\'s nothing small.\xc2\xa0 That\'s huge. And the people who get those notices will have Washington to blame -- in particular, unfortunately, the intransigence, the refusal to compromise and to do something reasonable and balanced that we\'ve seen on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one quick follow-up on the Woodward thing.\xc2\xa0 Another longtime, respected Washington journalist, Ron Fournier, came out and talked about Woodward, and he said that -- he talked about his own story about how he\xe2\x80\x99s received many what he called \xe2\x80\x9cvulgar and abusive\xe2\x80\x9d emails and phone calls from White House officials.\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you ever heard of anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been on the receiving end of a few in previous White Houses and I think -- it certainly didn\'t trouble me too much.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have any specific comment on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it just whining by the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this is a situation where people feel passionately about the policies that the President has and that previous Presidents have put forward.\xc2\xa0 And my predecessors and others felt the same way, I\'m sure.\xc2\xa0 And reporters are under a great deal of competitive pressure not just to get scoops, but also to have the most noticed opinion or observation.\xc2\xa0 And there are going to be disagreements about whether those facts or opinions or observations are on the mark.\xc2\xa0 I think it should be that way.</p>\n<p>I never took it personally when my former boss here, Rahm Emanuel, back when I was a reporter, would get on the phone and give me an earful about something he didn\'t like.\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t affect my relationship with him and it didn\'t stop me from talking to him.\xc2\xa0 I just happened to know that was Rahm\'s way.\xc2\xa0 And that was true in the Bush White House, not just the Clinton White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t affect our relationship with you either, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would the White House concede in some form that this was a miscalculation to put forward the sequester as a forcing mechanism now that we\'re on the eve of it going into effect?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I feel like this is Groundhog Day.\xc2\xa0 Let\'s go back to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But without relitigating the details, you guys played a part in some capacity of it -- the President or Jack Lew, Arne Duncan --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s unfortunate that Republicans who, again, shouted from the rooftops -- and I could read page and page and page of quotes from Republicans who said sequester should never become law, it would be the worst possible thing for our national security and other aspects of the government -- who now think that sequester is an effective political tool and they\'re perfectly happy with the consequences of sequester.\xc2\xa0 They were right that sequester was designed purposely to be bad policy.\xc2\xa0 It was designed that way and to be equally onerous for both Republicans and Democrats so that the prospect of its implementation would compel Congress to make tough choices.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, despite some -- going back to the argument about goalposts -- despite some proposals by some Republicans or at least suggestions that revenue be included in a package of deficit reduction that would eliminate the sequester and achieve our $4 trillion goal, Republicans in the end refused to do that, even though the President repeatedly put forward proposals that did that and continues to have a proposal on the table that does that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate the sequester may come to pass, and we would simply point you to statements not just by Democrats or the President but by Republicans who warned about all the negative impacts of sequester and said we have to do something responsible to avoid it.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- unfortunately, not from the leadership, but from a number of Republicans lately, including Senator Graham and Senator McCain and some House Republicans -- comments from them suggesting that it would be wise to close a few loopholes, or cap a few deductions, or eliminate some special breaks for corporations as part of a deficit reduction package to avoid sequester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given the intransigence and the impact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated in this conversation with us earlier today, is there no Plan B?\xc2\xa0 Is the sequester preferable to anything without tax cuts of some form?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen numerous economists, as well as the Chairman of the Fed, say $85 billion, you can\'t wish away the negative effects that that will have on our economy if it comes all in cuts in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s fashioned.</p>\n<p>The way to deal with this responsibly is to balance it with revenues gained from tax reform, closing loopholes, eliminating special tax breaks for industries that no longer need them and maybe never did, and asking millionaires and billionaires to carry some of the burden.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s a proposition that the American people overwhelmingly support.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a meeting between the President and congressional leaders on the sequester. Does this usher in sort of a new phase where we\xe2\x80\x99ll see more direct face-to-face negotiations among the parties to try to resolve this?\xc2\xa0 Or would you expect to see the President may still go out on the road, make his case to the general public?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing more --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not an either -- it never has been and it will not be an either-or proposition, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to travel around the country and talk about the issues that he thinks are important and the priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward in his agenda.\xc2\xa0 The suggestion that that\'s a bad thing to do I think implies that Republicans who criticize the President for talking about sequester with the American people don\'t want the American people to know about what\'s really happening here, which is not an approach we take.</p>\n<p>He will obviously continue to engage with Congress, as he has in the past, as he will tomorrow -- both congressional leaders and rank-and-file members of both the Senate and the House -- in an effort to try to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 We have an opportunity here still on the table for Congress to take up a balanced deal that would complete the job and then some of achieving more than $4 trillion of deficit reduction over 10 years, in a balanced way that helps our economy grow, that helps it create jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I change topic just for a second?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Really, do you have to?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 Why not?\xc2\xa0 In the midst of all this, has the President had an opportunity to sit down with your team, the national security team, to talk about what his message will be almost in two weeks when he goes to the Middle East?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any preview of that trip to give to you beyond what we\'ve said already, which the President very much looks forward to it.\xc2\xa0 The timing is good.\xc2\xa0 He believes as he begins his second term and as there\'s a new government coming into place in Israel, he very much looks forward to the trip both to Israel and Jordan and to Ramallah, the West Bank.</p>\n<p>Peter, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 What is your understanding of how and when this thing is going to kick in tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Some people on the Hill think that it\'s 12:01 a.m. tomorrow morning.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned 11:59 p.m.\xc2\xa0 There\'s also wording out there that the President has to sign --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding -- and I\'m a layman in this, but my understanding is that the law has a provision that requires the President to order the sequester on March 1st, which is tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And that means that it has to be done by 11:59 p.m. tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he wait that long?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he do it beforehand or will he wait --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- 11:59 and 59 seconds, because he\'s ever hopeful.\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t know what time tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you let us know when it\'s signed?</p>\n<p>MR.
