Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:51 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any statements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kathleen, do you want to start?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about a piece of legislation that Senate Democrats are pushing in response to the Flint, Michigan crisis.\xc2\xa0 This is a bill that would put up $400 million to fix lead pipes and also require Michigan to match the federal funding, and would require federal action if the state refuses to warn people about unsafe water.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if the White House supports the legislation, and if you think this is it in terms of what\xe2\x80\x99s needed in terms of federal reforms.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken a close look at the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I just got the top lines that you described shortly before walking out here.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously take a close look at the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s put forward by members of the Michigan delegation I believe in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a close look at that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are already a variety of things that the federal government and the Obama administration have already moved on to try to offer some assistance to the state and local officials who are responding to this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 That includes what the President and the EPA Administrator believe are needed reforms to the relationship that governs -- or to the rules that govern the relationships between the EPA and state and local environmental regulators.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s similar to the proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward legislatively to ensure that those regulations don\xe2\x80\x99t unnecessarily interfere with the ability of the EPA to make public information that could be directly relevant to the health and safety of the public.\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like this legislation certainly touches on some of the issues that we have identified. But I think what the administration is committed to doing is making sure that over the long haul we follow through on this response.\xc2\xa0 While certainly the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned that are included in the legislation are important, so, too, are the public health consequences for some of the failures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, the lead federal official in Michigan who is responsible for coordinating the overall activities of the federal government is a public health expert from the Department of Health and Human Services, again, mindful of the fact that there are significant public health consequences for some of the infrastructure failures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Flint.\xc2\xa0 So my guess is that even those who put forward this specific piece of legislation would not view it as the final word on assistance that could be offered in a helpful way to the people of Flint, Michigan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I wanted to ask another question about some action on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 It looks like, at least at the moment anyway, that Senator McConnell is not all that interested in moving criminal justice legislation this year.\xc2\xa0 And even some of the big supporters have suggested that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- Senator Cornyn recently said it\xe2\x80\x99s not critical that the legislation move this year. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s already lost steam.\xc2\xa0 This is one of your only -- maybe one of two major legislative priorities this year, and it seems to be stalling.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually identified, based on the last count, about seven different things we feel like we can actually work effectively with Republicans on over the course of this year to advance shared priorities.\xc2\xa0 These are things that we have identified as priorities, and things that Republicans themselves say they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in.\xc2\xa0 You noted one of them, criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 The other is, of course, ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was completed by the administration last fall.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other issues that the President has discussed that Republicans say they also support are things like significant investments in medical research and development, including the cancer moonshot that the President discussed in the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother thing that the President has indicated he supports is expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to offer additional tax credits to childless workers.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the Earned Income Tax program is an economically powerful way to keep families out of poverty, and this is a benefit that we believe can be structured to effectively help childless workers.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Ryan has indicated this is a proposal that he supports.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of talk on the campaign trail about fighting heroin abuse and addiction.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the administration has played a leading role in that.\xc2\xa0 We would take up Republicans and their stated interest in that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other things -- the authorization to use military force, again, something that some Republicans at least say that Congress should act on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying for more than a year now that this is something that Congress should do.\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Ryan, at the end of last year, committed to House action that would offer needed assistance to Puerto Rico, and we have long advocated offering the island of Puerto Rico, that government, the opportunity to restructure some of their debts in order to meet some of their financial challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are all things Republicans say that they support.\xc2\xa0 But as you note, we have seen comments from Republicans indicating that, well, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll get TPP done this year; maybe they won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Now they\xe2\x80\x99re saying something similar about criminal justice reform.\xc2\xa0 I think it does beg, though, one question, which is, what are Republicans going to do?\xc2\xa0 What is exactly their legislative agenda that they\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to advance?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got some ideas that they know are nonstarters.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of partisan initiatives that they put forward, like repealing the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to say that that would actually be a proactive legislative accomplishment, to actually undo something that has provided health care to 17 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 But maybe Republicans can make that case.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a different argument.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The argument I\xe2\x80\x99m making is, what\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican agenda?\xc2\xa0 The things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out seven of them\xc2\xa0 -- are things that Republicans say that they support.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re things that we say that we support.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we make progress on them?\xc2\xa0 And if they -- and I also recognize that a lot of times this gets covered as, well, Republicans deal another blow to the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative priorities.\xc2\xa0 I understand why that\xe2\x80\x99s the coverage.\xc2\xa0 And to a certain extent that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 But at what point, do Republicans actually have to start becoming more transparent about what their objectives actually are?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are in an election year, and the American people will be evaluating whether or not Republicans should continue to entrust the majority in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And based on the way that Republicans are talking right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure what they intend to do to demonstrate that they deserve that responsibility and that opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does the President plan to do about this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President plans to do is to continue to try to work in good faith with Republicans in those areas where we agree.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I walked through some things that the President certainly considers a priority, and we stand ready to work with Republicans to advance them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either of them is particularly ideological.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that any of them needs to be necessarily the kind of issue that breaks down along party lines.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly would be consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s stated view that he intends to make the most of every remaining day that he has in office, including by working with Republicans to advance legislation that would be good for the country.\xc2\xa0 The question is whether or not Republicans are actually going to have the courage to step up to the plate and reciprocate that interest and that action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Russia said today that Saudi Arabia has proposed cutting oil production by up to 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of these deliberations among oil-producing countries?\xc2\xa0 And would you welcome it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is certainly an interesting indication from the Russians about how concerned they are about their economy.\xc2\xa0 The Russian economy over the last several years has been isolated because of their destabilizing activities in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s had a significant impact on their economy in the short term, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also had an impact on their longer-term economic projections.\xc2\xa0 Those sanctions had been put in place around the same time that oil prices on the global market started to decline.\xc2\xa0 And those two things have combined to have a pretty negative impact on the Russian economy and on the prospects for Russian economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think it is notable that you see the Russians essentially looking for a lifeline from some other countries to try to cooperate with them to boost their economic prospects.\xc2\xa0 I think it remains to be seen whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be successful in doing that, but I do think that this admission from the Russians is telegraphing the kind of economic weakness that they have for the last couple of years attempted to deny.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You make it a point of saying that Russia has leaked this deliberately, but they did say that it was a Saudi Arabian proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m mostly reacting to are sort of the statements from the Russians that they were going to seek to try to work out some agreements with other oil-producing nations to address some of their own -- the weakness in their own economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have much insight into the announcement by the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you if we have a specific announcement from them -- or on their action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your point about Russia is understood.\xc2\xa0 But, generally, oil prices being at the low level that they are have had other impacts on the world economy.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House welcome a shift in policy from big oil producers -- such as Russia, such as, more appropriately, Saudi Arabia -- to alter that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific comment to share with you in terms of the energy policy decisions that are being made by other countries.\xc2\xa0 What the President has advocated for the United States is a policy that, over the long term, transitions the United States to a low-carbon economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the meantime, we need to be making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking advantage in a safe way of the natural resources that we have in this country.\xc2\xa0 And oil and gas production here in the United States is at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0 What also is at an all-time high is our production from cleaner sources like wind energy and solar energy.\xc2\xa0 And what the President envisions is a longer-term transition that will be good for the planet, but also capitalizes on the economy opportunity that exists when it comes to solar and wind energy and energy efficiency and other technologies where U.S. businesses and U.S. workers could really benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And then one other topic -- the World Health Organization today said that the Zika virus is exploding\xc2\xa0 -- or spreading explosively, and could affect as many as 4 million people in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Has the response been too slow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I think what you have seen from this administration is a response consistent with the kind of threat that could be out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think at this point, here in the United States, the risk of disease spread by mosquitoes is quite low.\xc2\xa0 The January temperatures in North America are quite inhospitable to mosquito populations.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change.\xc2\xa0 Eventually, the mercury is going to start to rise, and we need to be mindful of any sort of potential risk here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 What we also need to be mindful of is the risk that\xe2\x80\x99s facing, in particular, pregnant women or women who could become pregnant who might be considering traveling to regions of the Western Hemisphere where it\xe2\x80\x99s warmer and where the Zika virus has already spread.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The concern that we have is not with -- well, the concern that we have is most focused on pregnant women or women who could become pregnant because of a concerning correlation that scientists have between contracting the Zika virus and the manifestation of a particular birth defect.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s I think what explains the pretty serious reaction that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President convened the leading scientists and public health officials in this administration to discuss this issue in the White House Situation Room earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the CDC issue guidance to Americans who might be considering travel throughout the Western Hemisphere in the short term.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the ramping up of a public communications effort from the CDC, from the NIH, and other public health professionals about steps that Americans can take to protect themselves.\xc2\xa0 Just today, the CDC convened a tele-briefing to discuss this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we are in a stage right now where we want to educate the public about what the risks actually are.\xc2\xa0 For most people, the risk of the Zika virus is minimal because the Zika virus has relatively mild symptoms, and only one in five people who are infected with the Zika virus actually manifest those symptoms.\xc2\xa0 So our real concern is about this correlation between the Zika virus and a particular birth defect.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re mobilizing the kind of response that we believe is consistent with the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s going to be talking to House Democrats tonight.\xc2\xa0 What is his message to them on TPP, in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would not expect that the focus of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks would be on TPP.\xc2\xa0 Most Democrats don\xe2\x80\x99t support the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- at least not most Democrats in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 We believe we have a strong case to make to Democrats about why the Trans-Pacific Partnership is good for American businesses, is good for American workers, and is good for American middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 It levels the playing field for American businesses and American workers, and it cuts taxes on 18,000 American products that are imposed by other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so we have a strong case to make.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be making that case to the American public.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be making that case to Democrats who supported giving the President Trade Promotion Authority last year.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be making that case to Democrats who opposed Trade Promotion Authority but did at least leave open the possibility that they might support the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have a strong case to make and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.\xc2\xa0 But for the majority of Democratic members who will be in that room today -- or tonight, they obviously do not consider passing -- or ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership a legislative priority.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of other legislative priorities, though, that we do share in common, and I would expect the President will talk about some of those.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him directly about that tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question related to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech yesterday. A while back, the President indicated that he would -- the U.S. would be reviewing its position with regard to Middle East peace, so I wonder if in the next 12 months or so we could expect any fresh push to try and resolve or take small steps forward on the Israel-Palestine issue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any progress like that to tell you about that\xe2\x80\x99s been made recently.\xc2\xa0 So I would hesitate to predict much about that over the course of this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The focal point of our conversations with the Israelis right now -- or actually, on deepening and extending our security cooperation -- senior administration officials and their Israeli counterparts are in the midst of discussions about a memorandum of understanding that would extend the U.S. commitment to supplying the Israelis with defense equipment and technology that they need to keep their citizens safe.\xc2\xa0 And those negotiations have been ongoing as recently as this month.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of resolving the generations of disagreement between the Israelis and Palestinians.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Flint for a moment.\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of people there are concerned about the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s statement that he has no plans to replace any of the lead pipes in that community in the short term, or whatever his words were.\xc2\xa0 And the Mayor there, who has met with the President, has said that this is an awful thing, I guess -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the quote -- because the issue is a lack of trust.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of that decision?\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned about that decision, about something that narrow -- replacing these pipes -- and whether or not, in fact, that is going to set back any efforts to try and solve the problem there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in some ways you\xe2\x80\x99re asking a question that\xe2\x80\x99s directly about science -- about whether or not it is necessary to replace the pipes to ensure the safety of the water supply in Flint.\xc2\xa0 And there obviously will be environmental officials in Michigan taking a look at this question, and the EPA has offered to lend their expertise in terms of testing water quality and offering advice in terms of what steps the government of Michigan and the city of Flint should take to address this crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She said it was an issue of trust, not science, because people just don\xe2\x80\x99t believe him.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is not years later where concerns were raised, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t addressed, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the concern.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of trust, not science.\xc2\xa0 And is the President -- has he had any follow-up conversations with the Mayor or -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of how engaged he is.\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of things on his agenda, but how engaged is he in this particular issue at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know the President is regularly updated on the situation in Flint.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any additional conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with the Mayor.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in this situation has acknowledged that trust does need to be rebuilt between government officials and the residents of Flint.\xc2\xa0 The Governor of Michigan, himself, acknowledged that there was a broader systemic failure here, and I wouldn\'t disagree with that notion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think because these kinds of decisions should be driven by science, I think that\'s why it\'s particularly important that government officials and regulators take the steps that are necessary to begin to rebuild the trust with the citizens they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be looking out for.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other issue.\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be meaningful Syrian peace talks beginning tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For the latest update I\'d refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there has been a lot of painstaking diplomacy involved, both by senior State Department officials including the Secretary of State himself; officials at the United Nations; and other members of our counter-ISIL coalition who are trying to use their diplomatic leverage to get both the relevant opposition parties and their representatives to Geneva at the same time as officials representing the Syrian government.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is planned for Geneva are not face-to-face talks between those two groups of people, but rather proximity talks where you\xe2\x80\x99d have U.N. officials sort of shuttling between representatives of the government and representatives of the opposition to try to advance the diplomatic process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This has been hard work that\'s been underway for a long time and we\'ve made a lot of progress in terms of getting to this stage, and were hopeful that we can continue to move the ball forward.\xc2\xa0 But no one underestimates how difficult that challenge is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, it may be a difficult thing to measure, but is there any indication that the improved relations with the Iranians as a result of the deal and so forth -- does that have any positive impact on this process in Geneva?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The State Department would be best positioned to offer a judgment on that.\xc2\xa0 My guess is if there has been any change it\'s been largely at the margins.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\'ve seen any sort of overhaul or dramatic turnabout in the context of these negotiations that has occurred since the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Syria -- a question on that.\xc2\xa0 With the Russians bombing the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition on behalf of the Assad regime as recently as this week, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that undercut the credibility of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that that same opposition should agree to sit down with the regime backed by Russia at these talks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have on many occasions -- and when I say we, I include myself -- expressed our significant concerns both about the tactics that are used by the regime and their supporters to wage war against Syrian citizens.\xc2\xa0 And that is, after all, why we are trying to broker the kind of political transition that we\'re hoping to discuss in Geneva tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you have a government entity that is using weapons of war against its own people, you need a political transition.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the human suffering that has resulted from the failures of the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that a political transition will be required.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to be able to solve this militarily.\xc2\xa0 And it is our hope that through diplomacy and through talks and through a political transition, we can bring -- at least reduce the violence and chaos inside of Syria, if not eliminate it altogether.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you still think Russia is a credible partner here in these talks even though they\xe2\x80\x99re bombing the opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, our view of the Russians has been that there are a number of things that they have done that have not been particularly constructive.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\'ve noted that their heavy support for the Assad regime has actually set back our diplomatic efforts to reach a political transition.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve noted that on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 And it is primarily because of -- and again, the reason for that, it\'s just a practical matter.\xc2\xa0 If they succeed in shoring up their support for the Assad government and help stabilize the Assad government, and weaken the political opposition that we want the Assad government to begin negotiating with, you reduce, if not eliminate, any incentive that the Assad government has to negotiate in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the reason that we have found Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military involvement in Syria to be so concerning.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on another front here -- foreign policy, different country -- General Dunford said that the U.S. is looking to take decisive action in Libya against ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s consultations on this or potential decisions about that action?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in one regard, I would say that there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence that the United States has already taken some decisive action inside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 Back in November, because of U.S. military action, the leading ISIL figure in Libya was taken off the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 So the United States has long been mindful of the risk that is posed by the kind of political chaos that we see in Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that one of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s strategies is to capitalize on chaos in a particular region, and using that to try to establish the foundation of their hateful ideology and to further their aspirations for a caliphate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in Syria, and we know that they have similar aspirations inside of Libya because they see the same thing that everybody else does, which is that there is political chaos in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the United States has long supported the U.N.-led effort to try to broker the establishment of a government in Libya that reflects the will and aspirations of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s also why we\'ve been mindful of the broader security risk in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And I referenced one particular airstrike -- that\'s why the United States has taken steps to counter the growth of ISIL inside of Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any decisions to preview at this point, but the President has certainly been discussing the threat posed by ISIL in Libya with his national security team, and that discussion has included steps that the United States could take -- in close consultation with some of our European allies that obviously have their own set of experiences and resources to bring to bear there.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, countries like Italy have experience in that part of the world, and we would draw upon their resources, their skill and their expertise to advance our goals in that region of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, so what you\'re talking about is one strike, a targeted strike to take out a leader.\xc2\xa0 What General Dunford seemed to be talking about was more like a campaign and working with forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 That\'s different.\xc2\xa0 That would be, in that sense, an escalation or new front in the fight against ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Is that the way you\'re viewing this, as a new front, a third front against ISIS?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, it\'s too early to make any -- I don\'t have any announcements to make from here about any sort of policy decisions that have been made in this regard.\xc2\xa0 I think the point that I\'m trying to emphasize is that the administration and the President have been mindful of the risk that is posed by ISIL and their aspirations to operate more aggressively inside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'ve been strongly supportive of the U.N.-led political process inside of Libya.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why we\'ve already taken some military actions inside of Libya to counter ISIL. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have anything to tell you about any sort of potential actions or escalation with regard to our efforts against ISIL in Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, will the President tonight ask for an AUMF</p>\n<p>\n\t-- authorization of force -- when he speaks to Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are some Democrats in the House who do believe that Congress should fulfill their responsibility to pass an authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that the President has been advocating for more than a year now.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it will come up, but if it does, I think what House Democrats will hear is encouragement from the Democratic President that Congress should fulfill their responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, two questions on two different subjects.\xc2\xa0 One, back on Flint.\xc2\xa0 Back in the beginning of this administration, about seven years ago, this President had two cities in special categories, and those cities were Detroit and New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 And both of those cities wound up coming out of those special categories and special grouping because they had started climbing out of devastation either economically -- or, really, both economically, and the other, devastation of Katrina.\xc2\xa0 So now, with the situation with the water in Flint and some other areas in Michigan, is there a thought to put Flint and Detroit and that whole area maybe back in a special category again to maybe focus in on the issues that are specific and unique to that community?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I\'m not aware of any sort of formal designation that\'s being considered for Flint at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about the wide variety of resources that have been provided by the federal government just in the last few weeks to try to assist state and local officials who are responding to a serious situation there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is no doubt that the challenges facing Flint right now are daunting.\xc2\xa0 When you consider the work that may be required to overhaul and maybe even replace a significant portion of their infrastructure; when you consider, April, as you raised yesterday, sort of the longer-term public health consequences of the failures that we\'ve already seen; the need by government officials and regulators at the state, local and federal level to repair trust with the citizens of that community -- the challenges facing that community are daunting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think you raised an interesting point, which is they don\'t have to look much further than the city of Detroit to understand a few things.\xc2\xa0 One is that the federal government will be committed to following through on the commitments that we make to ensure that that city gets the support that they need to come back stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there were significant challenges that were facing the city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina.\xc2\xa0 The widespread devastation of that community and the dislocation of the population had a profound impact on that city and its prospects for the future.\xc2\xa0 But the President had the opportunity to visit New Orleans last November, mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and they spent a little time talking about the storm, but mostly talking about the renaissance of a great American city.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that the people of Flint, despite the daunting challenges, I think can really look to their neighbors in Detroit and they can look south to New Orleans for a lot of hope and inspiration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So and this leads to my second question.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about this renaissance in a great American city -- the President is going to Baltimore today.\xc2\xa0 There were calls for him to go to the area that was affected -- Penn North -- or just some of the blighted, more impoverished communities in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 In Baltimore today, will he -- or this evening -- will there possibly be -- maybe this is a security concern, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask, but I\'m going to ask -- could the motorcade kind of drive a little bit in a different direction than normal just to take a look at some of the areas that could be hurting -- while he\'s still in office?\xc2\xa0 Areas that supported him as President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect that today.\xc2\xa0 But I just remind you, the President did have the opportunity to travel to Baltimore in 2014, I believe it was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This happened in 2015.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I guess that means the President was ahead of the curve here in trying to address some of these problems that Baltimore has been challenged with for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not aware of any changes to the motorcade route to announce here today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he get any updates while he\'s there in the city?\xc2\xa0 I understand the reason why he\xe2\x80\x99s there, but will he meet with the outgoing mayor or other officials -- or Congressman Elijah Cummings, who is very active in the community?\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with community leaders to talk about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and changes possible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s visit today will be focused on House Democrats, so I will anticipate he\'ll have a chance to meet with Congressman Cummings, to visit with him in the context of the session with House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\'t anticipate a special discussion of the situation in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he get updates on Baltimore, on the situation in Baltimore and the other cities that have had the unrest last year because of the policing issues that they were dealing with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly is interested in making sure that we\'re following through.\xc2\xa0 And I know one thing the President does regularly get updates on is the success that we\'re having in implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\xc2\xa0 This is a task force that the President assembled in the aftermath of some of the unrest that we saw in cities across the country, expressing concerns about the actions of members of their law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a whole set of recommendations that were produced by this task force, and ultimately it will be up to local jurisdictions to decide how and whether to implement these recommendations.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the President is kept apprised of the efforts of local communities to implement those recommendations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to touch a little more on the Syria talks.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a clear answer to Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question of whether the President views Russia as a really credible partner in those talks -- given all of the sort of contradictions you laid out about what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing and what the ultimate goal is of the peace discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, again, we have expressed significant concerns in a variety of settings, including from here, about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military support for the regime and the negative that has on our ability to try to reach the kind of political transition that even President Putin acknowledges will be required to address the situation inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the President had the opportunity to sit down with President Putin at the United Nations last fall, we came out of that meeting with some disagreements with -- well, we came out not attempting to paper over the differences in our view of the situation inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 But both sides came out of that meeting acknowledging that both sides agreed that a political transition inside of Syria was necessary to ultimately address the problems that were having not just a terrible humanitarian impact on Syria, but a broader impact on the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the concern that we have is that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military actions contradict their assessment of the political situation inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have long urged the Russians to reevaluate the military strategy that they\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, given that, it is hard to describe the Russians as playing an entirely positive role.\xc2\xa0 But given the influence that Russia has with the Assad regime, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to be a part of this.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will use their influence with the Assad regime to encourage them to pursue the kind of political transition that even the Russians themselves acknowledge are necessary.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage the Russians to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at this point, given the influence they have with the Assad regime and given how isolated the Assad regime is, the influence that they will bear is important, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll use it in the right way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that yet, though, what is the point of these talks?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does the President still share Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s view that a cease-fire is possible in the short term?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s realistic at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Secretary Kerry and his team can give you the best assessment of where things stand, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d mostly defer to them about the likelihood of a cease-fire going into effect.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that Secretary Kerry has long been encouraging the parties to pursue and to agree to.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on those efforts for you at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President still believes that President Assad must go ultimately as part of any political transition that they agree on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And again, that view is rooted not just in our moral objections to the way that the Assad government has slaughtered innocent Syrian people, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also just a practical consideration.\xc2\xa0 The Assad regime has lost the legitimacy to lead that country primarily because they\xe2\x80\x99ve used their military to attack large portions of the population.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that that population is no longer interested in seeing Assad sitting atop their government.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s lost the legitimacy to lead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in order to have a government that actually reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people, somebody else needs to be in charge.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, as long as President Assad is there, we\xe2\x80\x99re still going to see instability and chaos that has consequences not just for a dire humanitarian situation inside of Syria but larger consequences for the region and potentially even the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Russia, this week we heard the Treasury Under Secretary tell the BBC that Putin is corrupt.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration share that view?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the assessment of the Treasury Department I think is the one that is the one that best reflects the administration view.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Treasury Department is responsible for enforcing sanctions, and obviously there are significant sanctions that are in place against Russia because of their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty blunt public statement, though, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s being asked now because it\xe2\x80\x99s something we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard in so many words before.\xc2\xa0 So if that is the case, a pretty black-and-white statement, why have we not yet seen sanctions against Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would encourage you to check with the Treasury Department about the sanctions that they have designed.\xc2\xa0 I think there are probably a variety of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, we obviously work closely with our European partners to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking coordinated steps to isolate the Russians and their economy.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly part of the equation here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the other thing that we don\xe2\x80\x99t do is we don\xe2\x80\x99t make a habit of announcing sanctions in advance, or spend a whole lot of time discussing in detail what sort of sanctions may or may not be considered by the U.S. government and our partners.\xc2\xa0 To do so would only give those who could potentially be the target of these sanctions the opportunity to take actions to evade those sanctions, and we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give anyone the opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, got it.\xc2\xa0 And last night, when the President was giving his speech at the Holocaust event, he again made a kind of what seemed to be another veiled reference to rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s been out there on the campaign trail, specifically coming from Trump.\xc2\xa0 And it seems like virtually every time we hear the President speak now, he makes a reference like that, and everybody kind of knows -- I mean, it tends to be just particular enough that you kind of know what he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to.\xc2\xa0 But here in the briefing room, we heard you repeatedly dismiss the level of support for Trump out there, dismiss the nature of his rhetoric. We\xe2\x80\x99ll say --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I, myself, have said that this many people are supporting Trump, and you seem pretty dismissive of what it represents on the whole, as well as the value of what he\xe2\x80\x99s espousing.\xc2\xa0 So if that is the case, why does the President feel it necessary to now constantly bring this up and to make these references?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you might -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time this has happened -- I think you might be reading a little too much into the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.\xc2\xa0 I think the President does frequently talk about his commitment to American values and talk about how those values represent the best that our country has to offer.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, the kinds of values that were on display by heroic Americans who saved the lives of innocent Jews who could potentially be in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way because of the Holocaust does represent the best of American values.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something the President has said on a number of occasions, even before any of the current candidates for President on the Republican side announced their candidacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is also true is there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that some of these values are the subject of a political debate.\xc2\xa0 And the President does continue to be confident that the vast majority of Americans does subscribe to the kinds of values that this country has long stood for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I would interpret those kinds of comments on the part of the President not as an attempt to rebut the claims of any particularly presidential candidate, or even any particular political party -- because, after all, many of the values and controversial comments that we see from Mr. Trump are consistent with the kinds of views that are being expressed by a whole range of candidates in the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re going to debate these values, the President is going to stand up and reinforce the values that this country has long stood for, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to hesitate to participate in that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But yesterday, in the context of Holocaust Remembrance Day, I feel confident in telling you the President was not trying to secretly respond to a political candidate.\xc2\xa0 He was seeking to champion the kinds of American values that led a few very brave Americans to selflessly look out for people who could otherwise be innocently victimized.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he -- blaming a group and tribalism, you think that those statements had nothing to do with the political rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s out there now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re a response to the claims, outrageous as they may be, of any particular candidate.\xc2\xa0 I think they are an expression, an affirmation of the kinds of American values that this President has spent his time in office championing.\xc2\xa0 And these are the kinds of values that make America the greatest country in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the fight against ISIS in Libya.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t get into too many specifics, but can you discuss at all what kinds of steps are on the table, or the scope of options that are being considered?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that at this point.\xc2\xa0 What I think I could do is to help you understand that the President has been talking with his national security team on a regular basis about confronting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And those conversations do include not just a discussion of our intense efforts in Iraq and in Syria, but also any steps that may need to be taken in other places where we see ISIL trying to establish a foothold.\xc2\xa0 And that obviously includes Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99d hesitate to get into the options that the President is weighing at this point.\xc2\xa0 The President will certainly consult with his national security team, consider the situation on the ground in Libya, and once he\xe2\x80\x99s made a decision, or if a decision is necessary, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to discuss.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any timeline on that at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not a timeline I have to share with you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a totally separate topic, Hillary Clinton earlier in the week said that she loves the idea of appointing the President to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 I know in the past he said that the Court is too monastic for him, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t ruled it out.\xc2\xa0 Is it something that he might be open to?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My guess is it is -- that his aspirations for his post-presidency extend beyond a Supreme Court appointment.\xc2\xa0 I think the constitutional lawyer that the President is I\xe2\x80\x99m sure would have plenty of things and plenty of ideas for how he would do a job like that.\xc2\xa0 But I think his preference for how he wants to spend his time after he leaves the White House would lie in areas that would give him the opportunity to handle a wider range of issues than just those issues that come before the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Pam.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of a presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders is going to co-sponsor a bill that would get rid of the immunity that gun manufacturers now enjoy, and it was something that he originally helped pass.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President might take credit for, seeing as he said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t campaign or support any candidates who didn\xe2\x80\x99t support common-sense gun measures?\xc2\xa0 And did they talk about that issue during their meeting yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details to share with you about their private conversation.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the legislation that Senator Sanders was discussing, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to him about what was motivating the change in his position on this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly has made a concerted effort to raise the profile of the kinds of common-sense steps that Congress could take to make our community safer, while at the same time protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President certainly would encourage other members of Congress to consider supporting that legislation.\xc2\xa0 But for Senator Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s position and his change in position, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him when that occurred and what prompted the change.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you saw it or not, but I was wondering if the White House might have any response to my colleague Chip Reid\xe2\x80\x99s report on the Wounded Warrior Project and how that charity spends as little as 54 percent of the money that it raises actually helping injured servicemembers, and has some other sort of frivolous expenses that they spend their money on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Pam, I actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Chip\xe2\x80\x99s report, but why don\xe2\x80\x99t we take a look at it, and if we can get you a response we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I just want to get your memories jogged. Where were you during the Challenger event?\xc2\xa0 What do you recall about that day?\xc2\xa0 And as Americans recall what for many was a similar moment, what does the President have to say about that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, we did issue a statement from the President shortly before I walked out here through NASA, which is what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in years past.\xc2\xa0 And the President himself has talked about how space exploration has long served as a source of inspiration to American students since even the President himself was a child.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMy own memories -- actually, I was in the fifth grade when the Challenger disaster occurred.\xc2\xa0 And I do remember vividly the lead-up to the launch of the space shuttle because there was an elementary school teacher that was on board, and there was a concerted effort that was made by NASA to discuss that mission in elementary schools and to hold Christa McAuliffe up as an example as an educator who was committed to science and the kind of exploration that was part of any sort of scientific endeavor.\xc2\xa0 So I do have memories of that as an elementary school student.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I think there are a lot of people who are involved in the space program today who say that they were inspired by those astronauts who gave their lives in pursuit of that cause.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that even 30 years later they serve as an inspiration to a whole generation of American scientists and innovators I think is a pretty good indication that while their loss was a tragedy, it certainly was not -- their lives were not given in vain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me get you to circle back for just a second on Flint.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that you said \xe2\x80\x9csome of the failures we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of blame to go around.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I just want to sort of drill down on the resignation of the Region IV administrator.\xc2\xa0 Is that a tacit acknowledgement that the administration made mistakes in this circumstance, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99m limited in what I can say about this because there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing Department of Justice investigation.\xc2\xa0 They will be responsible for taking a look at exactly who did what and when, and who bears some responsibility here.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot I have to say about that resignation beyond what that individual had to say about why they were leaving their post.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reason that we haven\'t heard more from Administrator McCarthy on the topic, certainly given that this story continues to sort of unfold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that last week she announced a number of steps that was responsive to the conversation that she had with the President of the United States last week.\xc2\xa0 This includes overhauling the rules and regulations that govern the relationship between the EPA and state-level regulators in states across the country.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are significant EPA resources that have been offered to Flint to conduct some additional testing and to offer other scientific advice that could help them address the problem that they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the other concern that the President has -- and this is one that I know that Administrator McCarthy shares -- is making sure that there is not some other community that is experiencing something like what Flint is going through.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately the EPA does have an important responsibility to protect the safety and public health of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Their responsibilities are significant, and I know that they take those responsibilities seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we haven\'t heard from her since last week, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, is she in Flint?\xc2\xa0 Is she going?\xc2\xa0 I just would expect, especially given the magnitude of the story, that she\xe2\x80\x99d want to be out in front on this, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look that way, at least from the outside.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s taken some important steps here.\xc2\xa0 Again, responsive to a conversation she had with the President and based on her own expertise about the way the EPA operates, she\xe2\x80\x99s taken the steps I think that people would expect that she would take.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that she is closely monitoring the situation moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Last, on Zika.\xc2\xa0 Given the weather here at this time of year, it may not be something that\xe2\x80\x99s rushing our way, but it does a great many of our neighboring countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 Is the President getting a daily update on this circumstance?\xc2\xa0 I know that WHO is making this sound fairly alarming, to be honest with you, and not just for pregnant women.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think their concern is much like ours.\xc2\xa0 Our concern does focus on pregnant women.\xc2\xa0 The symptoms from the virus are relatively mild.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody wants to get them, but the kind of symptoms that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are not life-threatening.\xc2\xa0 These are symptoms that relate to a mild fever and joint pain, and even conjunctivitis.\xc2\xa0 But those symptoms are only seen in about 20 percent of those who contract the virus.\xc2\xa0 And those symptoms go away after about a week.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe concern that we have is that there is a correlation between those who contract -- pregnant women who contract the virus and a particular birth defect.\xc2\xa0 And that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re primarily concerned about.\xc2\xa0 So the travel guidance that we have\xc2\xa0 -- that the CDC has issued relates to advice that is given to pregnant women or women who are thinking of becoming pregnant about traveling to some of these countries, and steps they can take to mitigate the risk that they face.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve shared this guidance for informational purposes for other people who may be traveling to these regions of the world. But the kind of risk that men, for example, face from the Zika virus is, at this point, based on what we know now, is relatively mild.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comparisons to Ebola really don\xe2\x80\x99t fly -- is that kind of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think some of the most prominent differences are the Zika virus is obviously not fatal in the same way that the Ebola virus was fatal.\xc2\xa0 The transmission of the disease is quite different.\xc2\xa0 The Zika virus is transmitted through mosquitoes, again, based on what we know now.\xc2\xa0 The way that Ebola was transmitted -- that there are a variety of ways that Ebola could be transmitted through intimate -- by person-to-person contact.\xc2\xa0 So I think those are sort of the two most prominent differences.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s true is that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we need to learn about the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 Our health care professionals have told us that there\xe2\x80\x99s no vaccine that prevents the disease, and the kind of treatment options that are currently available are quite limited.\xc2\xa0 And there is this significant concern about the correlation between the pregnant women who contract the Zika virus and a specific birth defect.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are certainly reasons to be concerned about this disease.\xc2\xa0 And I think that explains the federal response that\xe2\x80\x99s been mobilized here by the United States.\xc2\xa0 It certainly explains the kind of response that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in other countries.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are thousands of members of the Brazilian military that have been mobilized to try to counter this disease.\xc2\xa0 One of the most effective ways to actually deal with this disease is to limit the population of mosquitos that are known to carry the virus.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly -- mosquito control will certainly play into some of the steps that we will take here in the United States once the weather warms up to further protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now, our focus is on making sure that people have the facts about the risks that are posed by the Zika virus, and steps they can take to try to minimize that risk.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not at a point where if you\xe2\x80\x99re going for spring break, for example, you need to not go south of the border -- that kind of thing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re offering right now is just advice to people.\xc2\xa0 And our concern primarily is focused on pregnant women or women who are planning to become pregnant.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Angela.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for you to unpack something that the Vice President said while he was speaking at the Democratic retreat this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Just to quote him, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Ramadi, watch what happens in Raqqa and in Mosul by the end of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t elaborate, but he implied that those cities could be taken out of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s control in the near future.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is hoping that they can accomplish and that you see as a real possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, so --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was after you started the briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just say in general what we have said about ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s control of Mosul and Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 What the Department of Defense has indicated is that these are obviously strategically important areas to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And there are -- particularly in Raqqa, there are already steps that are being taken by the United States and our coalition partners to apply pressure to ISIL in those areas.\xc2\xa0 There are already airstrikes that have been taken by the United States and our coalition partners in Raqqa against ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 Those strikes have also taken place in the vicinity of Mosul, as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to keep up that pressure against them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, the decision to have Iraqi forces move against ISIL in Mosul -- that will be a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in close coordination with the United States and our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99ll also be relying on training that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received from the United States and our coalition partners, and military airpower that can be leveraged by the United States and our coalition partners.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The situation in Raqqa is a little bit different.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are opposition fighters that have made a lot of progress in northern and northeastern Syria, and they have advanced toward Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 But obviously in order to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL and accomplish that goal, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to get -- root ISIL leaders out of Mosul and out of Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant task.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been dug into those cities for a while now.\xc2\xa0 And it means it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to dig them out.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly are mindful of the fact that this will be necessary in order to achieve our eventual goal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Vice President being too optimistic, perhaps?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the entirety of his remarks, so I\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant to comment directly on them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On one other matter.\xc2\xa0 The President announced his cancer task force this morning, starting with a meeting next week.\xc2\xa0 Of course, his budget comes out the following week.\xc2\xa0 Can we assume that there will be a request for more funding for the National Cancer Institute in this year\xe2\x80\x99s request?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On North Korea issues -- on North Korean nuclear issues.\xc2\xa0 It seems like that President Obama is not interested in the North Korean issues or he ignored North Korean issues.\xc2\xa0 What is the U.S. final destination of North Korean nuclear issues?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We continue to believe that North Korea should come into compliance with their international obligations, both as it relates to their nuclear program and as it relates to their missile program as well.\xc2\xa0 We know that the North Koreans conducted a nuclear test earlier this month, and since then, the United States, including President Obama, has been in close consultation with our allies and partners in the region to design an appropriate and effective response.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been discussions that have been held at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 Within 24 hours of the tests being conducted, the President was on the phone with his counterpart, both Prime Minister Abe in Japan and President Park of South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And you saw both the Deputy Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, and the Secretary of State, John Kerry, traveling in the region just in the last couple of weeks, discussing this very issue -- not just with Chinese leaders but with other leaders in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what is notable about this situation is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United States and South Korea and Japan -- three important allies who agree that North Korea needs to give up their nuclear program and commit to actions that will make the Korean Peninsula stable and more secure -- we know that the Russians and the Chinese agree with that proposition as well.\xc2\xa0 And during Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s visit, I know that President Xi reiterated his commitment to a de-nuclearized Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And our agreement on that principle will be critical to our ability to achieving that goal.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, China has a closer relationship with North Korea than just about anybody else, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will continue to work closely with us to use their influence to advance safety and security on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recently, South Korean President, Park Geun-Hye recommended Five-Party talks instead of Six-Party talks for denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 Will the United States support this Five-Party talks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said before [is] that the North Koreans would need to demonstrate a commitment to stability and security on the Korean Peninsula and giving up their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That is essentially -- that would be the essence of the conversation, and so we\xe2\x80\x99d have to see a commitment on the part of the North Koreans to actually wanting to have that conversation before we would sit down at the table with them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately where things stand right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to bring it back to that conversation that you were talking about at the top about bipartisan efforts in terms of eradicating cancer.\xc2\xa0 I know you put something out on this, this morning.\xc2\xa0 What are the administration\xe2\x80\x99s latest efforts on this effort?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do have the -- you saw that the Vice President had a post on Medium today where he talked about some of the preliminary efforts that have just gotten underway in the last couple of weeks since the President announced this initiative.\xc2\xa0 There will be a meeting that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for next week where I would anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information on this.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you anticipate and you\xe2\x80\x99re open to the idea of some sort of bipartisan legislation moving this effort forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have seen -- and, again, there are some Republicans who are pretty aggressive advocates for investing in research and development that could lead to medical breakthroughs.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the things -- one of the areas where Republicans have been relatively enthusiastic about increasing funding, and the budget is behind those efforts that could advance our understanding of particular medical phenomenons and scientific breakthroughs.\xc2\xa0 And so there should be an opportunity for us to work together to make sure that that funding is at appropriate levels and is focused on the right things, and we certainly are interested in having that kind of conversation with Republicans who are actually interested in working in a bipartisan way on this.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason this should be ideological or should breakdown along party lines -- it just needs -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is a partner with a seriousness of purpose when it comes to fighting cancer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 1:57 P.M.
