EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position is right now on Shirley Sherrod?\xc2\xa0 Should she get her job back?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- Secretary Vilsack is -- has tried and is trying to reach Ms. Sherrod.\xc2\xa0 When the Secretary reaches her, he will apologize for the events of the last few days and they will talk about their next steps.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- I think, clearly, that a lot of people involved in this situation, from the government\xe2\x80\x99s perspective on through, acted without all the facts.\xc2\xa0 Now, as you saw Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s statements from last evening, now that we have greater knowledge and a broader fact set, he is going to review all of those facts, and that\'s what he\'ll talk to Ms. Sherrod about today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does the Secretary plan to offer her her job back?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that\'s something that -- the Secretary and Ms. Sherrod are going to talk through those next steps.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in this?\xc2\xa0 Can you walk us through that, from when he first found out to the present?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the President was briefed on this sometime yesterday, most likely in the morning.\xc2\xa0 This was, as you heard Secretary Vilsack say yesterday, a decision that was made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0 The President was briefed yesterday and has been briefed obviously today as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So did he or anyone at the White House direct that she be fired?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not to my knowledge, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to a lot of people trying to follow this story, they see a government employee who ends up losing her job because of comments posted and a videotape that appears to be taken out of context -- it just looks bungled.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair way to put it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, I think this is one -- I think this is a fair way to put it:\xc2\xa0 Members of this administration, members of the media, members of different political factions on both sides of this have all made determinations and judgments without a full set of facts.\xc2\xa0 I think that is wholly and completely accurate.\xc2\xa0 I think without a doubt Ms. Sherrod is owed an apology.\xc2\xa0 I would do so certainly on behalf of this administration. <br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if we learn -- if we look back and decide what we want to learn out of this, I think it is, as I said, everybody involved made determinations without knowing all the facts and all the events.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that happened?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak for everybody involved, but I think we live in a culture that things whip around, people want fast responses, we want to give fast responses, and I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that if we all look at this, I think the lesson -- one of the great lessons you take away from this is to ask all the questions first and to come to that fuller understanding.\xc2\xa0 I say that, again, from the perspective of this administration; I say that from the perspective of those that cover this administration, and those that are involved in the back and forth in the political theater of this country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one on this.\xc2\xa0 That apology from the Secretary, does that reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s view as well?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I did so just a few moments ago on behalf of this entire administration.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does sound like you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to the President about this.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what does he think of it?\xc2\xa0 Does he agree that she was a victim of a rush to judgment?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d be out here, Matt, giving you the answers that I just gave to Ben without having those reflect the feelings of the President and the feelings of members of this administration.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he angry about the way this has transpired?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, we -- decisions were made based on an incomplete set of facts.\xc2\xa0 We now have a more complete set of facts and a review is being done as it should be.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what, if any, concern is there within the administration that the mishandling of this Sherrod affair could hurt the President and the Democrats as well in an election year?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is -- your question encapsulates a little bit of what I was talking about a minute ago.\xc2\xa0 I know there is a -- we have this society and this culture now that\xe2\x80\x99s pervasive in this town where everything is viewed through the lens of who wins, who loses, how fast, by what margin.\xc2\xa0 Look, a disservice was done; an apology is owed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done. This administration has never looked at -- I think if you go well back into the campaign -- never looked at a scoreboard at the end of each day to figure out where we stood.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other subject.\xc2\xa0 Financial regulations -- the President signed the bill today.\xc2\xa0 He said that reform would, in fact, bring certainty to the business community.\xc2\xa0 But we have major business groups -- the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, the ABA -- saying that it actually brings greater uncertainty, could have unintended consequences --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where business -- that the uncertainty about how the new regulations will be implemented, the welter of regulations that are being introduced --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are people that believe that the regulations that governed our economy and our financial industry up until the moment the President signed that piece of paper into law, that that was just fine; that if some people take some risks, make some gambles, and we all owe money because of it, or if 8 million people lose their job because of it, that\'s just fine.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has a different take on that.\xc2\xa0 The President is glad that we are not approaching the second anniversary of the financial collapse with the same rules in place that led to a tremendous retraction in economic growth, more than 8 million jobs lost. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nI think in many ways government is about choice and about choices.\xc2\xa0 I will let those that oppose this bill defend the choice that the rules that we had in place are the ones that should continue to govern the financial sector.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly does not believe that and, thank goodness, three Republicans in the Senate put aside those partisan differences to ensure that a very strong piece of legislation that will protect consumers and Main Street is now the law of the land.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ed.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wanted to go back to Shirley Sherrod because when you started out by staying that Secretary Vilsack is going to call her and apologize, and then, as you put it, talk about the next steps -- here we are two days later; presumably people in the White House have seen the full tape, realize that it seems an injustice was done here.\xc2\xa0 Why is there still vagueness?\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President, the Chief of Staff, or someone here picked up the phone and said, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, make a decision\xc2\xa0 -- instead of saying we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out the next steps?\xc2\xa0 Why the vagueness?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99m being vague, Ed.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Agriculture employs a number of people to carry out the duties and the functions of the Department of Agriculture.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there are clearly some things that Ms. Sherrod will likely want to talk to Mr. Vilsack about, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let that conversation happen.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than Tom Vilsack or any department.\xc2\xa0 This appears to be an injustice.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President intervene instead of letting this all fall on the Agriculture Department?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have a fuller set of facts.\xc2\xa0 A review is taking place and the Secretary is trying to reach Ms. Sherrod to apologize for the exact injustice that you talk about.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shirley Sherrod --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me -- can I -- if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind, let me finish a few of my answers.\xc2\xa0 As I said, a disservice was done, for which we apologize.\xc2\xa0 I think the next step that has to happen is the Secretary needs to speak with her.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s tried to reach her and we hope that that --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to tell her something specific or --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ed, I\xe2\x80\x99m --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- like offer her her job back or something?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve all got deadlines.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to let these conversations happen.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Now, Shirley Sherrod has told CNN several times that Cheryl Cook, the Deputy Under Secretary at Agriculture, called her three times on Monday when all this was starting to unfold, was pressuring her to resign, and specifically said that the \xe2\x80\x9cWhite House wants you to step down.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the interview that the Secretary did with --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secretary said that -- and told CNN yesterday he did not, himself, speak to anybody inside the White House, but there are thousands of people who work at the Agriculture Department.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, and as I said to Ben earlier, I know of no conversations that have happened like that, as the Secretary said.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no one at the White House urged her --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I answered your question.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Apparently she\xe2\x80\x99s watching this briefing, Shirley Sherrod, on CNN right now.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you want to say to her?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know where she is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m being quite serious.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s watching --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s watching you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And let me -- the Secretary is trying to reach her.\xc2\xa0 I hope that the Secretary reaches her soon and they have an opportunity to talk.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary will apologize for the actions that have taken place over the past 24 to 36 hours, and on behalf of the administration, I offer our apologies. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, this is more directed at everybody writ large here.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody has to go back -- we have, we will continue to -- and look at what has happened over the past 24 to 36 hours, and ask ourselves how we got into this.\xc2\xa0 How did we get into -- how did we not ask the right questions?\xc2\xa0 How did you all not ask the right questions?\xc2\xa0 How did other people not ask the right questions -- and go from there.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I asked the right questions.\xc2\xa0 I actually called her before we reported on this to find out what her end of the story is, so you can fault the media if you want but --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not faulting the media, Jake, but I -- no, no, hold on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to fault the media.\xc2\xa0 I apologize on behalf of the administration.\xc2\xa0 I will say a number of people called quite quickly after these comments aired and wanted to know what our response was.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who else called.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know who made calls trying to seek a greater understanding.\xc2\xa0 We made a mistake on that and I think many involved in this made mistakes on it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve heard conservatives and liberals say this administration overreacted because you\'re afraid of conservative commentators.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s any truth to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up on financial regulation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the things about -- one of the uncertainties a lot of people in the business community are worried about has to do with the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s so much rulemaking that has yet to occur.\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of rules, dozens of studies.\xc2\xa0 Is that not a possible reason because there\xe2\x80\x99s so many things that were left vague in this legislation -- is that not a possible reason --<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s not -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 Rulemaking doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take place based on legislative vagueness.\xc2\xa0 Rulemaking is -- happens in virtually every piece of legislation that is passed in order to implement legislative directives. <br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but the Vice President said that the business community right now should not have uncertainty because this legislation has passed.\xc2\xa0 But the truth is they don\'t know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- who\xe2\x80\x99s going to count as somebody whose derivatives need to be monitored.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t know what the fees are going to be. <br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the legislative intent is clear.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that -- I think this provides certainty for people on Wall Street; it provides certainty for people that work in the financial industry; and I think it provides certainty for those on Main Street that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be protected. <br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, there were those -- I think many of the people that you discussed -- let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- spent tens of millions of dollars, hiring hundreds if not thousands of lobbyists to water down the legislation and stop it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the role that many of those people played that you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that -- I think the motives of those I think are important to understand.\xc2\xa0 And I do think this provides certainty for all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question about Shirley Sherrod.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think there was such an overreaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, I think in a frenzied culture where everything happens so quickly, where -- when everybody -- when one person has a story everybody has to have a story, and responses are given, mistakes in this case clearly were made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, during the campaign, particularly during the speech on race in Philadelphia, the President said he would use every opportunity to advance dialogue on race.\xc2\xa0 Since taking office the President has had numerous opportunities or these teachable moments to advance the dialogue on race.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he done more to advance the national discussion on race and race relations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this is one of those teachable moments, and I think -- we contacted the Department of Agriculture last night in order to ensure that fairness was done in this and that a review that the Department of Agriculture is doing is undertaken.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- I think a teachable moment is a moment in which the facts change and you react to those different facts.\xc2\xa0 I think this is one of those moments, and I think that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s happened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he call a national -- because the Congressional Black Caucus has asked for a national summit on race.\xc2\xa0 Would the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard a discussion about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s a teachable moment, who\xe2\x80\x99s the teacher?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to hear from the President on this, do you think?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the teacher is -- I don\'t think -- I don\'t know who the teacher is in this, Chip.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the teacher is, in and of himself, necessarily the President.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think everybody asks themselves questions about the events of the last 24 to 36 hours.\xc2\xa0 I think based on those common-sense questions that you\'re asking -- that everybody asks themselves -- you find a moment that you can learn from.<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out the President speaking about this, using it as a teachable moment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out, no.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you heard -- you mentioned that you did -- you were with the President when he talked about this, I think.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us some specific words? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I talked to the President today about this.\xc2\xa0 I was in the -- I talked to him about this yesterday --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us specifically some things that he said about this?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he talked about the fact that a disservice had been done here and that an injustice had happened that -- and because the facts had changed, a review of the decision based on those facts should be undertaken.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question of why there was this overreaction, some have suggested that it was because this administration is particularly sensitive, some say hypersensitive, on issues of race.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t agree with that any more than I did the characterization about conservative columnists or whatever.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And forgive me if I missed this, but has the President talked to Vilsack about that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he planning to?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I can check.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what happens to Vilsack?\xc2\xa0 Is his job safe?\xc2\xa0 Is it up in the air?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think -- again, I think Secretary Vilsack will acknowledge the mistakes that he made based on the information that he had when he made that decision.\xc2\xa0 But I think he\xe2\x80\x99s doing terrific work at the Department of Agriculture.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, follow up on Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question real fast?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just very --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me come back.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you -- since she is watching, did you want to directly address her?\xc2\xa0 Since she\xe2\x80\x99s watching?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would apologize on behalf on those involved here for what has happened.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why -- have you gotten an explanation of why she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply put on administrative leave -- why she went from administrative leave to fired in less than 24 hours?\xc2\xa0 Did you get a proper explanation for that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not asked that question, but I might direct you to USDA.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President think this is a story about race or about the media?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it is a -- I have not talked -- did not ask the President that question directly.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there\xc2\xa0 -- I think all of that is involved in a larger story that combines rapid advances in technology, a whole host of things that are involved in culture and race and media and politics, that create an environment that we\xe2\x80\x99re living in today.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nI\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of when the President spoke at the memorial service for Walter Cronkite and mentioned -- and told the story that Cronkite would tell about not just getting something first but getting something right.\xc2\xa0 I think that is true for all of us involved here.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the issue with this government settlement with Black Farmers had anything to do with Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s overreaction here?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 As many of you know, the department is in the midst of paying out a settlement for decades-long discrimination.\xc2\xa0 I think as you saw in the statements from Secretary Vilsack that, rightly, the department has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination.\xc2\xa0 And the reason it does so is because of -- if you look back at the history of some aspects of the way USDA benefits have been dispensed, they were done so in a way that people have acknowledged were discriminatory.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that played a direct role in this.\xc2\xa0 I know that is something that Secretary Vilsack is mindful of in having a zero-tolerance policy.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you just misspeak?\xc2\xa0 Because the money has not -- Congress has not approved --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, but there were -- there have been a series of different settlements.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that -- obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s several billion dollars on this.\xc2\xa0 Again, the settlement has been entered into based on a judgment of discrimination.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on financial reform, can you square this circle:\xc2\xa0 If this ends \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail,\xe2\x80\x9d why is there resolution authority to deal with \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because resolution authority -- no, no, resolution authority --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do the two --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to our AIG example, right?\xc2\xa0 You have what by all accounts was a well-performing insurance company that somebody had the bright idea of attaching a hedge fund to the top of, right?\xc2\xa0 And when all that become so intertwined that when mortgage-backed securities fail miserably, you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority -- hold on -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the authority to break those two apart.\xc2\xa0 You either have to figure out how, if there\xe2\x80\x99s systemic risk involved, as what happened with AIG, the decisions that were made at that point to ensure that that failure didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to a larger -- but now what we have is the ability to break apart.\xc2\xa0 In other words, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t fix it, then you\'re liquidated.\xc2\xa0 And that is a vast --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But then you haven\'t ended \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve just figured out a way how to --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no -- \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re allowing these firms to get --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, \xe2\x80\x9ctoo big to fail\xe2\x80\x9d presumes that once you become so big that -- well, first of all, I would say there obviously are limits on the size and scope of certain aspects of financial instruments, derivatives being brought into the sunlight.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But understand this, Chuck, that what happened with AIG was the only steps that could be taken were to ensure that this meltdown didn\'t affect the broader economy, because -- because there\xe2\x80\x99s not the authority legally to break apart these instruments and say, let\xe2\x80\x99s sell this, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep this because it\xe2\x80\x99s a successful business over here, let\xe2\x80\x99s not have -- I mean, again, somebody had the bright idea of putting a horribly risky hedge fund on top of --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But is this legislation designed to prevent AIG from doing that, or to unwind AIG if they do it?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Both.\xc2\xa0 Both -- it prevents certain activities from happening.\xc2\xa0 It takes certain activities into the light of day.\xc2\xa0 But it also allows that if something like that gets into trouble, if a series of risky investments are made and ultimately they can\xe2\x80\x99t cover the damage that they\'re about to do, you break it apart and you get rid of it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t mean -- so to follow your logic, so you\xe2\x80\x99re admitting that maybe everything you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do to prevent these firms from getting bigger won\xe2\x80\x99t work and they could end up getting risky --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that that\'s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there now is the -- understand this, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Before this signature, there\xe2\x80\x99s no legal authority to resolve by breaking apart.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no legal authority that takes part of this business and sells its assets to cover the losses of something else.\xc2\xa0 Legally, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the mechanism doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xc2\xa0 Now, legally the mechanism does exist.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s -- yesterday morning\xe2\x80\x99s staff communications meeting, what did Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina say about the handling thus far of the Shirley Sherrod incident?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know which meeting you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of what somebody believed Jim said.\xc2\xa0 I did not hear Jim say that and I think other people in that article say that Jim didn\'t say that either.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what do you say happened at that meeting?\xc2\xa0 Was there -- did this come up at the staff meeting yesterday? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You mean talking about the events at USDA?\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Now, you said that there is no truth to the idea that right-wing media spooks this administration.\xc2\xa0 Yosi Sergant, Van Jones, now Shirley Sherrod have all come under attack from Glenn Beck, Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, Andrew Breitbart -- none of them are at this moment members of this administration.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain those three departures?\xc2\xa0 Do they really have nothing to do with the campaign that had been waged against them?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was asked a larger question about this, and I -- my answer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change.\xc2\xa0 Why do you do stories on all three of them?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they will be included in the stories tomorrow, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You do not -- you do not see any connection between --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You answer my question --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and between Shirley Sherrod\xe2\x80\x99s assertion -- she was told that Glenn Beck was going to have her on the TV that night.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, you want to answer my question about why you\xe2\x80\x99d do those stories, too?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what that question is.\xc2\xa0 Why would I do that --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll check on that and get back to you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, has the press office or anyone here at the White House put the freeze on the Agriculture Department in terms of taking questions from reporters?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been our experience in the past 24 hours or so that they are not being responsive.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\'m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 That certainly wouldn\'t be a directive that came from here, no.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ms. Sherrod obviously did not enjoy, if you will, due process, to say the least, through this whole thing.\xc2\xa0 How do you think this whole episode is going to affect the way future sensitive personnel decisions are going to be handled by this administration --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope in just the way I discussed earlier.\xc2\xa0 I hope that everybody involved takes the time to learn what happened; that we make decisions based on a full set of facts, not on a partial set of facts.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial re-reg, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House going to do to fend off lobbying, to soften or change the impact of the regulations?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously there will be an extensive rulemaking procedure in order to fulfill the legislative intent, and I think that -- again, I think we\'re clear at what provisions mean and what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to prevent and how and what activities should and should not be allowed.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the implementation of this, the additional offices and bureaus that the legislation calls for would be important appointments for the President to consider.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Major.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question, Ms. Sherrod seems very convinced that the White House did play some role in this and is willing to say so publicly.\xc2\xa0 That is her conviction, that she is under the impression based on repeated conversations --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would direct you to the --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that she has a misimpression, that she\xe2\x80\x99s somehow got information incorrectly --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I would direct you to what the Secretary said yesterday and the answer that I gave Ben.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the Secretary talked about what he did.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s asserting that others indicated to her --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re parsing the way that --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m just trying to separate what is publicly available.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, which I\'m not challenging.\xc2\xa0 But others at the Agriculture Department might have.\xc2\xa0 And she\xe2\x80\x99s under the impression and is saying publicly she believes the White House did play a role in this.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And as I said to Ben, and as I said to Ed, that\'s not anything based on my knowledge.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re absolutely convinced that that did not happen?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I can only answer your question three times.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re actually only answering it once.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I gave you the same answer three times.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fine.\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be any effort put forward by the administration to let us talk to Cheryl Cook about what she did or did not say to Ms. Sherrod?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'d direct you to USDA about speaking to her.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay for her to talk to us about this?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d direct you to -- you ask the same question, I give you the same answer. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On -- no, I\'ve got a couple others.\xc2\xa0 Ben Bernanke today said that he believes the economy -- the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree, generally speaking, with --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going the get into parsing or interpreting what the Fed chairman says.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe to say that we have -- if you look, Major, at where we were and where we are, we are -- we have improved our circumstances, improved our conditions, but I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt that it\xe2\x80\x99s not improved for enough people.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President and the team will continue to work on.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a component of uncertainty that this administration also sees out there that the Fed chairman sees?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think, Major, that we are in, as we have been, quite frankly, since well before December of 2007, we have a fragile economy.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more economic question.\xc2\xa0 Rahm told The Washington Post and it was published on Sunday that the administration was looking forward to and had every reason to anticipate a strong -- a somewhat strong second quarter, but G forces that he described as the Greek debt situation, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s call for budget cuts throughout Europe, the Gulf oil spill, and the Gaza flotilla situation created an atmosphere of uncertainty that led consumers to not spend as much, led investors not to invest as much, CEOs not to act as economically -- as aggressively as they might.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that?\xc2\xa0 Is that a theory that the economic team --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ve said before I think -- I won\'t get into every one of your Gs, but --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not mine.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just quoting what he said.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, to understand where we were economically in April, what happened in Europe with Greece, and not to assume that that has had an impact on our economy -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that on a number of occasions, of course.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And all the others?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously there is -- I\xe2\x80\x99d lead the Greek G.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we can get back to Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s role in all of this.\xc2\xa0 My understanding from the timeline that you just suggested here and that other White House officials have said was that the White House was informed but not consulted about his decision to fire her.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary has said that, too.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that it took pressure from the White House last night for him to agree to reconsider that decision.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say, as I think we have said to a number of you today, we, the White House contacted the Department of Agriculture and a review was agreed upon.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who made that call?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into who talked directly to them.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does this -- does this not do anything to alter the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgment of Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s ability to run this department and his judgment and his -- especially given this department\xe2\x80\x99s history on these kinds of issues?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the Secretary rightly has a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination.\xc2\xa0 I think that the Secretary made a decision based on the information that he had, and is in the process of trying to reach Ms. Sherrod to apologize for having made that decision on that incomplete information.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And nobody asked for the tape of the full speech or anything like that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we are -- based on the fuller information that we have, these decisions are being reconsidered.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lots of us have reached her.\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t he reach her?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be that she\xe2\x80\x99s not taking his call.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to you.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you just walk us through a little bit President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s role in this?\xc2\xa0 When was he told?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said earlier, he was told about this I believe sometime like -- I forget the time -- probably likely late morning yesterday.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what was his initial reaction to what he had heard and how was --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, based on what -- again, I don\'t have the exact time with me.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think as we had said yesterday, that based on incomplete information and based on the decision that was made on incomplete information, the White House was supportive of that decision.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, new information came to light, and that\'s why the review is being undertaken.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But who was it that first told Mr. Obama about this?\xc2\xa0 How did he first learn of it?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A group of staff -- again, I don\'t remember what time.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you remember when he found out about the additional information that she actually -- that her quotes were taken out of --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At some point yesterday, but I don\'t know the exact time.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in -- you don\'t know --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was involved in the first discussion with him. I don\'t know who -- I don\'t know how he was briefed last -- yesterday afternoon and early evening.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I understand, in response to some of the questions about why you think this has gone so viral so quickly, you say a lot of this is because of the frenzy, people react really quickly without getting the facts.\xc2\xa0 But why do you -- I mean, a lot of this -- part of the reason why people reacted so quickly I think at the end of the day is because this is about race.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think this issue of race remains so inflammatory?\xc2\xa0 And what does the President say about how to handle it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does he express frustration when this sort of thing happens?\xc2\xa0 How has he been --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know this, I know this, I think everybody knows this.\xc2\xa0 This was -- race has been a topic of discussion for a long, long time in this country.\xc2\xa0 We -- a war was fought about it.\xc2\xa0 A movement to gain equal and civil rights was had to rectify injustice.\xc2\xa0 And it continues to be something that we will discuss for quite sometime.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is -- this just continues many of those discussions.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three real quick ones on three other subjects.\xc2\xa0 Jobless benefits.\xc2\xa0 Are you ready -- what are you hearing about the timing of it?\xc2\xa0 And are you ready to sign --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this.\xc2\xa0 I think many of you saw the statement that we released.\xc2\xa0 Despite the fact that the procedural hurdles that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had to go through, we went through and were passed, Republicans have insisted on the full 30 hours of that debate.\xc2\xa0 The partisan minority continues its stalling effort for the unemployment insurance that 2.5 million Americans so desperately need -- that have -- those are the people that have been cut off from.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As soon as the Senate takes this up, the House will have to take this up.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as that happens, that bill will come here and the President will sign it as quickly as he can.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Public ceremony?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think part of that depends on the -- Mark, our desire is to get this signed into law.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Consumer protection agency, are you able to move on that quickly?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, the President, as I said earlier, will make some appointments based on the law that was signed.\xc2\xa0 I do not expect an imminent announcement on that.\xc2\xa0 I would say --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next week?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve got highly qualified candidates.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of positions that the President will be looking at.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the consumer office is -- the consumer bureau is one of tremendous importance.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does Elizabeth Warren\xe2\x80\x99s shall we say close questioning of Secretary Geithner move her out for that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 She is -- look, I think in many ways, Elizabeth Warren is -- this is what Elizabeth Warren thought should be put in place to ensure that consumers were on equal footing with big banks.\xc2\xa0 I think she would be a terrific nominee.\xc2\xa0 I have seen comments by those that questioned whether she could be confirmed, and I don\'t agree with those at all.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Robert, this all sounds a little absurd.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Sherrod has not exactly been hiding.\xc2\xa0 And Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s office was able to reach her three times yesterday on her cell phone.\xc2\xa0 She says she has the same cell phone with her.\xc2\xa0 When did he start trying to reach her?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sometime today.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it must have been fairly recently because apparently her phone still has not rung, same phone she --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ann, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to deliver it to the Secretary to make sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s calling the right one.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She says since you --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, don\'t do that out here --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your statement here and she heard you, she says that she was most struck by how this would play for her grandkids that the first black rural director in Georgia was fired by the first black President.\xc2\xa0 Does that have some resonance?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- decisions on personnel at USDA were made by USDA.\xc2\xa0 Those decisions were made based on an incomplete set of facts and they\'re being reviewed based on a more complete set of facts.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 This situation is -- regardless of who is involved and regardless of their race, the decisions were wrong. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, today the President signed yet another big, consequential piece of legislation and this one is very popular with the public.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- all of these accomplishments, legislative successes don\'t seem to be changing the public\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on the President\xe2\x80\x99s job performance.\xc2\xa0 And even though I know he says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do them because --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, he signed it about three hours ago.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, I know, but this has been around for a while.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what instant polling has been done in the interim, but --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, okay, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting financial reform isn\xe2\x80\x99t brand new.\xc2\xa0 And he says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do these things because they\'re popular, but because they\'re right. But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take before all of these accomplishments begin to have --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We still need 8.5 million jobs to come back.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s it, pure and simple?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think people have, rightly so, a continued frustration about the economic situation in this country.\xc2\xa0 I think the rules that we had in place that led to the financial collapse two years ago contributed mightily to the 8.5 million jobs that were lost.\xc2\xa0 That is not something that was going to be easy to replace.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the last six months of 2008 and the last six months that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in 2010, you find a difference of losing 3 million jobs and gaining more than half a million jobs, so we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big hole to fill. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think -- look, the President is frustrated.\xc2\xa0 I think\xc2\xa0 -- what was the story that he said -- if your neighbor had lost their house, if your other neighbor had lost their live savings to send their kid to college, and if you\xe2\x80\x99d lost your job, and a pollster called you and said, how do you feel about the country, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- or how do you feel about the President, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a wild-eyed stretch to believe that you would think things still need to get better in this country.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening tomorrow?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We are signing I believe the bill on improper payments that was passed recently -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information on that.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Improper --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Improper payments by government.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China has expressed concern that the U.S.-South Korean naval exercises announced yesterday will further destabilize the region.\xc2\xa0 Do you accept -- does the White House accept those concerns?\xc2\xa0 And what is the political message that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to send to China?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wait a second -- are you guys changing the oil down there?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We need a smaller filter for the four cylinder --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Part of Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s contract.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say -- the makeup person is next, I presume.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here we go.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Stephen.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One TV guy cannot go after another TV guy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on down here, Stephen, but -- a whole different set of naval exercises.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China has said that it\xe2\x80\x99s concerned that the U.S.-South Korean naval exercises will destabilize the region even further. Does the White House accept those concerns?\xc2\xa0 And what political message are you trying to send to North Korea?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that these are exercises that are defensive in nature, and defense sends a clear signal of deterrence to the aggression of North Korea and in support of the defense of South Korea.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the condemnation of those in the administration and in the international community for the events undertaken by North Korea, and certainly we are strongly supportive of exercises that demonstrate South Korea defending itself.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow on that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask quickly -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this has been asked.\xc2\xa0 Is the President trying or does the President want to reach Shirley Sherrod himself?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe the President has tried, but I will check.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect him to?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a few questions on Shirley Sherrod and on the Black Farmers.\xc2\xa0 One, who here at the White House viewed the entire videotape?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a number of us have now.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Was the President one of those?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has seen the entire tape.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s seen portions of it, is that what you\'re saying?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Now, early on, you said -- you talked about the frenzy and the immediacy of the news cycle.\xc2\xa0 This is not the first time this administration has gotten caught up in the immediacy of the news cycle when it comes to issues of race.\xc2\xa0 The first time we saw the press conference when President Obama talked about his friend Henry Louis Gates and the police sergeant in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 What say you on matters of race?\xc2\xa0 I mean, some have accused this administration of not being able to embrace race with the historic nature of this presidency.\xc2\xa0 But yet again you say you\xe2\x80\x99re embracing it but you\xe2\x80\x99re very -- you react without getting all the facts on these two incidents of race.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, look, April, I\xe2\x80\x99m not up here to make excuses for -- actually, quite the contrary -- on what has happened in this case.\xc2\xa0 I think many involved at all levels believe, rightly, that not all information was gotten.\xc2\xa0 I think rectifying that is tremendously important for everyone.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel serious domestic items are being hijacked because of issues of race and the racial drama that\xe2\x80\x99s been playing out?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, no.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And going back to something that Kevin had asked earlier about the CBC, they\xe2\x80\x99re asking for a national dialogue.\xc2\xa0 This is from the CBC and a quote from them:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe also believe that a national dialogue on race must be held.\xc2\xa0 The basis for Ms. Sherrod\xe2\x80\x99s resignation is another example of why we must not sweep race under the rug.\xc2\xa0 Rather, we must come together as a nation and recognize that we do not live in a post-racial era, and that, while difficult, we must confront these issues head on with clarity and without fear.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Bill Clinton held a conversation on race.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration feel they need to hold one?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will go back and check.\xc2\xa0 As I said to Kevin, I have not heard discussions about that in here today.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Black Farmers -- you brought it up with Chuck.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know where the legislation -- I will check on, and you should check with members on Capitol Hill that might have, quite honestly, better intelligence about the level at which -- what\xe2\x80\x99s in different drafts of supplemental appropriations that need to go through.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John Boyd says the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it in the war bill.\xc2\xa0 He says that the administration is saying no way, and the President in particular doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want it there.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the impression that\xe2\x80\x99s been left with me, but I don\'t know -- I do not know the latest on what\xe2\x80\x99s in what bill.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Shirley Sherrod matter, administration officials have repeatedly said that they were informed but not consulted on her forced --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I agreed with that statement earlier.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does that mean?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between those two things?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The difference between being informed and consulted.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the decisions that were made on hiring are made, as I said earlier, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a department run by the Secretary of Agriculture, and they informed the White House of the decisions that had been made.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the White House, which official was informed initially that that decision --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there was interaction between a number of people.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could someone have -- from the White House have said, presumably after being informed, that this is not acceptable?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was not an acceptable decision?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was there someone in the White House who could have red-lighted this at that moment in time?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this was a decision that the Secretary made based off of incomplete information.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know about the Secretary.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken publicly on this.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to go back in terms of that hypothetical.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 Someone in the White House was informed about this and decided not to say it was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 Who was that individual?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this was based on -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to make excuses for the decisions that were made.\xc2\xa0 They were wrong.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The notion of responsibility implies that an individual was --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'ve certainly -- for the actions of our administration, I\xe2\x80\x99ve --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about accountability? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But who was it?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is someone going to be held accountable?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let me finish.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it goes to his question.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Weirdly, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask it.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a better one.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there you go.\xc2\xa0 You guys get together in a group and we\xe2\x80\x99ll play Jeopardy. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nLook, I have, throughout this -- throughout today, right here, taken responsibility for our actions. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m the lucky guy that gets to go talk to you.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- can\xe2\x80\x99t we just put a final point on it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- you talked quite significantly about sort of this frenzy of overreaction and the way that folks are responding --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but who individually is responsible for this in the White House, as opposed to --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there are a number of people that are responsible.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of people responsible at the USDA.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a number of people that have been involved in this situation at many different levels and in many different venues, that will, as a result of this, take a look at the actions and decisions that were made.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you at least tell us who in the White House reversed course and called the Agriculture Department and said, we need to review this?\xc2\xa0 Can you at least tell us that information?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The White House.\xc2\xa0 The White House.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different subject.\xc2\xa0 The President was scheduled to meet -- or have lunch with House members today. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who were they and what was the topic?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not have the list of members here, but I will get that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there was a set topic.\xc2\xa0 I think much like the senators that came over here recently, there were I assume a number of topics.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get a clear readout and the folks who came.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, in terms -- back to Shirley Sherrod -- in terms of a teachable moment, Van Jones and Shirley Sherrod aren\xe2\x80\x99t exact parallels, but is one of the lessons to be learned here that the administration should not be so quick to throw its own people under the bus?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, I don\'t know that I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to separate out and not get into something that happened last year.\xc2\xa0 I think that, again, decisions were made based on what we knew at that time. <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But both the cases --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, let me finish.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of Agriculture made that decision. I think everyone goes back and thinks, what could you have done differently, what would you have done differently?\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll all have an opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think that is an important role.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what makes it teachable.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what you learn from.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Robert, is the lesson don\'t trust the Internet, or what?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you have to -- I think when somebody puts two-and-a-half minutes of video up and people play two-and-a-half minutes of video off of a 43-minute speech, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably important for both the news organization transmitting the two-and-a-half minutes and what they purport that it means, and for those involved making decisions about somebody\xe2\x80\x99s career and their life, to do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s true as I started out this briefing by saying, those on the political playing field that are going to commentate -- and I don\'t mean necessarily pundits, interest groups on this side or that -- to do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s clearly what the NAACP has done over the course of the past 24 hours.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think this is something where -- again, I think what makes this teachable, what makes this something you learn from, is us taking a step back and looking at the decisions that were made based on that incomplete information, what questions you should have asked, when you should have asked them, both -- as Glenn asked -- both here and at the Department of Agriculture.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I had a lot of people asking for a response to the two-and-a-half minutes.\xc2\xa0 Nobody birthed on Monday that the two-and-a-half minutes was really 43.\xc2\xa0 My guess is you heard from a lot of your editors saying, go get reaction to this story.\xc2\xa0 And I think that groups get involved in this.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This whole issue of, like, advances in technology, 24-hour news cycle, the question right now -- are you saying, in effect, that advances in technology allow for things to be taken out of context, as opposed to real journalistic standards where you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to put things in context without advancing any particular agenda, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s liberal --<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t doubt that even in some context some people might decide -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always had opinion writers in this country.\xc2\xa0 But I think that sort of in some ways oversimplifies this.\xc2\xa0 The context here wasn\xe2\x80\x99t somehow that the two-and-a-half minutes was not contextualized properly.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a complete recitation of what she had said.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, again, that is put up on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 That is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 You all see it.\xc2\xa0 You all want reaction.\xc2\xa0 We get reaction.\xc2\xa0 You transmit both the two-and-a-half minutes -- not the 43 -- the reaction that\'s based off the two-and-a-half minutes, not the 43, and decisions are made on personnel based on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody involved in that chain that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think that from start to finish this couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been handled and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been handled differently.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on an unrelated subject -- on jobs.\xc2\xa0 Last week, at the jobs summit, Chamber of Commerce CEO said, if you really want to create jobs, increase economic growth, you temporarily extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts -- temporarily -- versus the President is only calling for an extension of your middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Is there some possible medium, just a temporary extension?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously this is an issue that is going to come to the fore based on, as you said, the expiration of the 10-year 2001 tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is on, as you heard in the campaign, those that affect the middle class.\xc2\xa0 We had -- we instituted those tax cuts at a time -- I was asked\xc2\xa0 -- I think I was asked yesterday -- I think it was yesterday or Monday -- about unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 Well, the economic situations have changed.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t -- how can you continue to -- how can you pass an extension of unemployment insurance based on the fact that the budgetary situation has changed? <br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\nI think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to ask ourselves whether, given our budgetary situation, tax cuts for those, as the President has said on numerous occasions, that people didn\xe2\x80\x99t need and people weren\xe2\x80\x99t asking for are something that, given where we are, can be afforded budgetarily.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will you let us know when the President calls her?<br/>\n\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
