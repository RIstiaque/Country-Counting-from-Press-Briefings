EST</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us as we head to Ivy Tech Community College where the President will discuss the importance of middle-class economics, specifically making the paychecks of working families go further, preparing hardworking Americans to earn higher wages, and keeping good high-paying jobs here in America.</p>\n<p>The President will also be joined today by a bipartisan group of elected officials, including former Senator Dick Lugar, who is on the plane with us this afternoon; Senator Joe Donnelly; Congressman Andr\xc3\xa9 Carson; and Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, who will actually introduce the President.</p>\n<p>I also want to draw your attention to Ivy Tech\xe2\x80\x99s renowned apprenticeship program, an initiative that serves as a model of how technical and community colleges can successfully coordinate to help students advance towards an industry-recognized credential.\xc2\xa0 To date, more than 9,000 apprentices have been awarded college degrees through Ivy Tech\xe2\x80\x99s program, and apprentices have an average starting wage of north of $50,000.</p>\n<p>And as you all know, just last week, the President unveiled efforts to align more than $50 billion in education and workforce investments to support more programs that link apprenticeships, on-the-job learning, and the chance to earn college credit.</p>\n<p>So, with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can you say about the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s claim that an American hostage that has been held there has been killed?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Nedra, I saw those reports.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously deeply concerned by those reports.\xc2\xa0 We have not at this time seen any indication to corroborate those claims, but that\'s all we have right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any information that she was in the area where this bombing campaign was going on?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I know these reports are a few minutes old, so I can assure you that our intelligence community is looking into them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say in general what the United States does when we conduct our airstrikes to ensure that American hostages or other hostages being held by the Islamic State are not in the vicinity?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as with all of our coalition partners, the United States supports and coordinates with the Royal Jordanian Air Force as they continue to fly over Syria.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense on how that works, but we do coordinate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can I ask you how closely has the U.S. tracked this woman\xe2\x80\x99s location while she\xe2\x80\x99s been in custody or has been a hostage of ISIS?\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. know where she is, generally?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I appreciate the question, but I don\'t have an intelligence assessment to read out to you at this time. I can tell you that, of course, the United States of America spares no effort to secure the safe release of any American held overseas.\xc2\xa0 That includes exhausting military options, intelligence resources, diplomatic channels, obviously the financial stranglehold we put on ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So I can speak generally to that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Eric, what\xe2\x80\x99s the intelligence community doing now to verify this?\xc2\xa0 Do we have the CIA investigating this?\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to confirm or disprove these reports?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have anything further to tell you about this.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are deeply concerned, and as soon as we have anything additional we\'ll be in touch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, the Benghazi Select Committee has said they intend to interview several current and former administration officials, including several presidential aides.\xc2\xa0 How are you responding to that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that press release, Nedra.\xc2\xa0 I will say that, as you know, we\'ve cooperated with all legitimate oversight requests heretofore on Benghazi, and that\xe2\x80\x99s actually been a two-year journey with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And every time I turn around, there\xe2\x80\x99s another committee in Congress issuing a report exonerating us from any of the conspiracy theories Republicans have proffered over the past two years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve participated in 22 congressional hearings, over 125 member and staff briefings, and dozens of witness interviews.\xc2\xa0 All told, again, I believe that several of the committees have issued reports giving us a clean bill of health on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this point, have you determined whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99ll make those officials available?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t even seen the request.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen a press release on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about yesterday -- the President got some criticism for his comments at the prayer breakfast.\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised by that?\xc2\xa0 And what is your response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that commentary, Anita.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has spoken many times to his belief in American exceptionalism.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes America is the greatest country on Earth not only because of our military might or economic prowess, or because we serve in a unique leadership role amongst the international community, but part and parcel to America\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world is our values, and those are values like equality, tolerance, fairness, civil rights, human rights, treating every human being with respect and decency -- no matter their gender, their race, their faith, their sexual identity.\xc2\xa0 Part and parcel to that and our values are holding ourselves up to our own values and our own standards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President believes that when we fall short of that, we need to be honest with ourselves and look inward, and hold ourselves accountable.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what gives us the moral standing around the world -- not just because we assert it, but because we hold ourselves accountable.\xc2\xa0 So whether that\xe2\x80\x99s our elected officials, whether that is a free and vibrant press, a judiciary system that\xe2\x80\x99s independent -- those are the values the President was talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he think he would have that kind of criticism?\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised by that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Fair question.\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken with him about the reaction to the remarks, but I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a failed presidential candidate, an RNC chairman from the past who have criticized us.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to either of those two people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also being criticized by some Republicans, like Rob Portman, who\xe2\x80\x99s not one of these conservative pundits.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican senator who said that he\xe2\x80\x99s troubled by the idea that the President was drawing some sort of moral equivalency between what ISIS does and things done in the name of Christianity.\xc2\xa0 Was he trying to draw a comparison and a sense of equivalency between those two things?\xc2\xa0 Or does he reject that characterization?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, what I think the President was trying to say is, over the course of human history there are times where extremists pervert their own religion to justify violence.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was trying to talk about yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did President choose the national prayer breakfast to make those points?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you look at the entire text of the remarks, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see how well suited they were for that audience and that setting.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think the President -- I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to his speech earlier this year at the United Nations General Assembly, where he spoke very compellingly about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 standing in the world and how part and parcel to that standing is us living up to our own values and our own principles.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about the event today, actually?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about I guess things that came up in the State of the Union and the budget, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the first travel since the budget.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple members of Congress -- you said a few that are around -- but has he talked to leadership in the last week about his budget rollout and what he wants?\xc2\xa0 Has he talked to any congressional leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific conversations to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that we are absolutely in touch with House members, Senate members and their staffs of both parties, working through the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities and what he laid out in the budget, and a lot of the proposals, like today\xe2\x80\x99s, on making the first two years of community college free for all Americans, working through those to achieve -- make that a reality.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President garnered any bipartisan support for the community college proposal?\xc2\xa0 When he announced it, he talked about Senator Alexander being from a state that does a similar thing.\xc2\xa0 But to date, I\'m not aware of any Republicans who have signed on, or even said anything good about his approach to doing this.\xc2\xa0 Has there been progress behind the scenes?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\'m so glad you asked, Julie.\xc2\xa0 I went back on the calendar and I looked that we announced this proposals 27 days ago.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I\'m not surprised that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t passed this yet, because it is a significant proposal.\xc2\xa0 And as you point out, it is an idea that has engendered bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 This was a program that was started under a Republican governor in Tennessee, adapted by a Democratic mayor in Illinois, and now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Democratic President talking about it in Washington.</p>\n<p>So while this is not law yet, we believe the conversation just started, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to lifting up those ideas today in Indianapolis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the conversation on the AUMF with Congress -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the timetable for sending up language?\xc2\xa0 And can you quantify at all for us the behind-the-scenes sort of conversations and consultations that have gone on about what that resolution should say?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I believe my colleague, Josh Earnest, has put the timetable at \xe2\x80\x9crelatively soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to stick with that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out today.\xc2\xa0 Can you now rule out --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can rule out today, yes.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that consultations have been robust; that right after the New Year break, the President sat down with leadership.\xc2\xa0 This was a topic that came up in the discussion.\xc2\xa0 And it was clear that leaders on the Hill wanted to do this -- wanted to get this done.\xc2\xa0 It was also clear that this is a priority for the President and that they wanted language from the White House.\xc2\xa0 They also wanted to be consulted in advance of sending that language up.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing -- robust, intensive, discussions, bicameral and bipartisan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in those discussions?\xc2\xa0 Do you have senior administration officials on the Hill talking to people about this?\xc2\xa0 Cabinet members, the National Security Advisor?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We have a whole team that\xe2\x80\x99s working on this.\xc2\xa0 That includes folks from our White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office, our national security team, our legislative team, and maybe even a communications person or two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got some labor questions for you, Josh -- or, excuse me, Eric.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it as a compliment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, when looking at the West Coast ports, there\xe2\x80\x99s a potential of a shutdown of those ports in the next seven to five days.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in knowing if the White House would be willing to do anything along the lines of what Bush did and employ Taft-Hartley to force those negotiations to go forward and for the workers to go back to work.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Annie, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 And I can assure you that officials at the White House and across the relative agencies are closely monitoring the situation.\xc2\xa0 Right now, our belief is that both sides should be resolving this at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Taft-Hartley something that\xe2\x80\x99s off the table for you, or is it something that you\xe2\x80\x99d consider?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just a premature question, because we believe both sides ought to resolve this at the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense that they\xe2\x80\x99re about to come to some sort of resolution?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about $2 billion a day in loss.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We believe this ought to be resolved at the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 We believe they\xe2\x80\x99re working expeditiously to do so, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be resolved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another labor question, or similar lines -- U.S. oil workers have -- negotiations have broken down with U.S. oil workers in nine plants, which could potentially have a terrible effect.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if the White House has been involved at all in helping those negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific pieces of involvement to read out to you at this time.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you this is another situation that we are monitoring, and it\xe2\x80\x99s yet another situation that should be resolved at the negotiating table through the sort of collective bargaining that has been known to help be an instrument to resolve these in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s not a federal monitor in that case -- mediator in that case.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 I just meant in the colloquial term that we are monitoring it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just one other question.\xc2\xa0 On the Department of Energy -- the Department of Energy pulled a $1 billion commitment for a clean oil plant in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 And this is a project that had been sort of a marquee clean oil project for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, like, why was the administration\xe2\x80\x99s mind changed on this particular project?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Energy for details on their decision to close out the federal support for the project.\xc2\xa0 I think it was becoming clear to them that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be able to meet the budgetary deadlines to use funding that Congress had set aside for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it any sort of retreat from the clean coal efforts that the administration has backed?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the administration has shown unprecedented support for clean coal technologies.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to our budget released this week that includes a new proposal for tax incentives to support clean coal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On arming Ukrainian rebels, there seems to be growing political pressure for this.\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, Josh seemed to open more of a door by talking about a level of bloodshed that may call for arming them.\xc2\xa0 Where does the White House stand with this decision?\xc2\xa0 Are they holding off until the President can speak with Chancellor Merkel?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I know your question was premised on rising political forces, but I just want to be clear that a decision like this made by the President would only be made by what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the national security of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have an update for you on this.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Josh has discussed this at length over the past few days, specifically our hesitations on this, which I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to repeat include that given the military might of Russia, no amount of lethal aid that we would supply could bring the Ukrainians on par with that.\xc2\xa0 And then, also that our fundamental belief is this is something that should be resolved diplomatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, in Yemen, rebels have taken over and dissolved parliament.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House response to that?\xc2\xa0 And does that change our counterterrorism strategy there?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll do both.\xc2\xa0 We have seen the reports that the Houthis held a public press conference in which they announced a new presidential council and their intention to dissolve the Yemeni parliament.\xc2\xa0 We are deeply concerned with this unilateral step.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this doesn\'t meet the standard set by the U.N. Special Representative for Yemen, in which our goal is to convene both parties to achieve consensus.</p>\n<p>And in terms of our counterterrorism operations, as the President said a few days ago now, those remain uninterrupted.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have a change for you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more time, can you just confirm that the United States is not investigating or trying to confirm whether or not this American female hostage was killed?\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t said whether they\'re investigating or not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking if they are.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear:\xc2\xa0 We have not yet seen any indication to corroborate ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s claim, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be clear that members of the intelligence community are absolutely looking into this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Susan Rice\xe2\x80\x99s event today?\xc2\xa0 I know she\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to get into a lot of the details of the document itself.\xc2\xa0 But can you speak a little to how the document came together, who put it together, who wrote it, why you\xe2\x80\x99re putting it out now, and what has changed in the five years since you last put out the National Security Strategy?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Kevin.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, National Security Advisor Susan Rice is going to have a lot more to say on this, I believe maybe right now, at Brookings.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you in terms of the process that was put together, it is the culmination of a very long process, an exhaustive process, a process that takes into account senior leadership of the departments and agencies.\xc2\xa0 And that includes Department of Defense, Department of State, our partners who work on trade issues, the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 And this also includes high-level discussions with both Ambassador Rice and the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on why you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to put it out at this point in time versus -- I know you said you\xe2\x80\x99re going to start working on it in 2013, so why is it now that it\xe2\x80\x99s coming out?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to just take a step back and realize that this is a document that provides strategic perspective to span several years, offering direction that has to go a little bit deeper than the daily headlines.\xc2\xa0 So therefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual to take a substantial amount of time to put it together and then put it out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any effort or any thinking that went into getting it out before you request new authorization from Congress for the operation against ISIL?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was there a thought that you should have a document that reflects the governing principle before you ask for specific authority to strike Iraq, Syria and maybe other places?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, on the AUMF, we believe that we already have the authority under the 2001 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes that we present a much stronger front to the international community when both branches of government are speaking together.</p>\n<p>In terms of the timing, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s tied to the AUMF language, but I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s tied to the budget.\xc2\xa0 Because, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, the budget that we released earlier this week conforms to the National Security Strategy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:16 P.M.
