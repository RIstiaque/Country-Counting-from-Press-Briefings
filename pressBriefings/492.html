MST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us this evening.\xc2\xa0 For your briefing pleasure we have Ben Rhodes, a familiar face -- Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0 We also have Evan Medeiros, who is Senior Director at the NSC for Asian Affairs.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide a topper for you about our visit to the Philippines, and then we\xe2\x80\x99re all here to take questions if you have them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I give you Ben.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a few words about the Philippines, then Evan will, and then we can take questions about the events of the day or other things.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow we will be completing and signing with the Philippines a very important agreement that will allow the United States access to basing in the Philippines in a way that will build out our defense and security cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And Evan will speak to that in a moment.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All I\xe2\x80\x99d just say at the outset is, throughout the course of the last several years, as a key part of our strategy of rebalancing to the Asia Pacific, we have sought to build out our alliance relationships, our cooperation with other partners in the Asia Pacific, and our ability to respond to a variety of missions.\xc2\xa0 You see that manifested in the increased cooperation in Northeast Asia, with Japan and the Republic of Korea, both bilaterally and on a trilateral basis.\xc2\xa0 You see that, for instance, in the agreement we had for a rotational presence in Darwin, in Australia, where we have a MAGTF and other military presence that allows us to respond to, for instance, natural disasters; do other types of joint exercises in the South Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And you see that in the defense relationships that we\xe2\x80\x99ve built up with ASEAN countries, including Malaysia, where we have a range of joint exercises, information-sharing, and defense cooperation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this agreement I think comes in the context of the United States being more present and more capable to build partnerships and meet specific missions, not just in Northeast Asia where we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the traditional presence, but also in South Asia.\xc2\xa0 And again, tomorrow will be an important step forward in advancing that cooperation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, Evan can give you a little more background.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure today to be able to confirm that tomorrow the United States and the Philippines will be signing our new Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, EDCA.\xc2\xa0 This is the most significant defense agreement that we have concluded with the Philippines in decades.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What the agreement is, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a framework that facilitates enhanced security cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines that will allow us enhanced rotational presence at facilities in the Philippines.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a basing agreement.\xc2\xa0 This is not a sort of return to bases, so to speak.\xc2\xa0 But rather what it does is it\xe2\x80\x99s a framework that will allow us to train and to exercise with the armed forces of the Philippines on a range of missions, including humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, maritime security; countering transnational crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, for example.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The scope, the duration, and the timing of this rotational presence is something that we will work out with the Philippines as part of a consultation process under our longstanding 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty Framework with the Philippines.\xc2\xa0 The agreement itself has been under negotiation for about eight months.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had eight rounds of negotiation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a longer conversation that the U.S. military has been having with its Philippine counterparts over the last few years as they have started to shift from an internal security-focused mission to an external security-focused mission.</p>\n<p>And as an alliance partner and as part of the broader regional strategy that Ben outlined to modernize our alliances, we began this conversation with the Philippines about how under this alliance framework we can help them facilitate this shift toward external security.\xc2\xa0 And this new agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99re signing with the Philippines is going to be a very significant contribution to that.</p>\n<p>So why don\xe2\x80\x99t I stop there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer any questions.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little about what this means for the long-term U.S.-Philippine relations just over the course of the last 30 years since the bases were --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 And I think it shows how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come in building out a very mature partnership based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, for the Philippines, as they have built their democracy and taken significant steps to deepen their democratic governance, issues of sovereignty are very important to them.\xc2\xa0 And we have a long history as an alliance, but we also have a complex history associated with some of those issues.\xc2\xa0 And what I think it shows is that over the last several years we have been able to deepen the alliance in the context of both the Philippines advancing its democracy, but also the United States and the Philippines identifying common interests in Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific more broadly.</p>\n<p>To give you one example, I think one event that gave some momentum and underscored the importance of this type of agreement was the typhoon response, because it was the United States that was able with our capabilities to reach affected areas much more effectively than any other country could.\xc2\xa0 And this type of agreement that could allow, for instance, the U.S. air and naval assets to rotate through Filipino facilities would contribute to the ability to have a very nimble and effective response to a disaster like a typhoon, which tragically is not a non-common occurrence in this region generally that you have those types of natural disasters.\xc2\xa0 It also will help us develop the Filipino capacity to respond in those types of disasters.</p>\n<p>So I think it shows that here, in 2014, we have identified a set of common interests around disaster response, maritime security, and joint capabilities between the United States and our ally, the Philippines, and our other partners in the region that makes this the right time to take our partnership and our alliance to a new level with this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it speaks to the emphasis that we have put on the alliance with the Philippines and also Southeast Asia more generally as a focal point of the U.S. rebalance to the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And that manifests in the relationships we\xe2\x80\x99re building with our ASEAN countries as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Evan, you said that it will allow U.S. forces to train with the Philippine armed forces on issues like disaster relief, maritime security and the like.\xc2\xa0 But you mean they\xe2\x80\x99re actually going to do more than just training; they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be there, present to take action immediately, right?\xc2\xa0 And can you be more specific about the rotation of ships, troops, planes, basing of that sort?</p>\n<p>MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t be more specific, because the agreement itself is just a framework.\xc2\xa0 It creates a legal and policy infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of like the skeletal and the muscular infrastructure that over time, as we talk with the Philippines about what their needs are and what missions they want to work with us on, we will then work through what the specific nature of the training and the exercising will be.</p>\n<p>But as I said, the Philippines are involved in this shift in their military, from internal security missions to external security missions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working with them about how best we can help them build up their capability to meet what they call credible minimum deterrence -- that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of their defense strategy.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re still working through those specific capabilities with the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this appears to be aimed as a deterrent, in other words, you use it as a deterrent towards China\xe2\x80\x99s assertiveness, militarily --</p>\n<p>MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this because of China. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing this because we have a longstanding alliance partner.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re interested in stepping up our military-to-military engagement.\xc2\xa0 There have been a variety of instances, as Ben pointed out, like Typhoon Yolanda, where it became clear that an enhanced rotational presence, a legal and policy framework for the U.S. military to work with their Philippine counterparts was something that was needed by the Philippine government.</p>\n<p>For example, one of the lessons that we learned from Typhoon Yolanda is that there are civilian and dual-use airports in the southern part of the Philippines that would benefit from certain types of upgrading so the U.S. military, U.S. Air Force could use them for things like humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The only other thing I can say, Matt, is you don\xe2\x80\x99t -- hypotheticals of missions that might occur in the future -- but when you look at the types of things that we work with the Philippines on, we\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned disaster response.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on counter piracy; we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on the ability to have joint exercises across the region.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on countering proliferation and transnational crime.</p>\n<p>So again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a flexible agreement that will allow us to position assets as necessary to provide that training and to do that type of joint effort with the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Yes, Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this an unusual arrangement, having this kind of rotational situation -- not a permanent force?\xc2\xa0 And is there an agreement yet on whether the Philippine government will have access to the areas where the Americans are building out their own facilities?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, yes, absolutely, these are fundamentally Filipino facilities.\xc2\xa0 So clearly they will be present and will have access to their bases.</p>\n<p>On your first question, I think increasingly as we look at our defense approach, we have traditional bases in different parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 But given the nature of the threats and challenges that we face, it is necessary for us to be able to respond in a manner that is nimble with our partners.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also necessary for us increasingly to train capable and effective allies and partners.\xc2\xa0 And so, these types of agreements give us that flexibility without necessarily having a base that would get at sovereignty issues for the Philippines and also, is clearly a more resource-intensive endeavor over the long term for us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that we can take in different parts of the world to meet different challenges.\xc2\xa0 Here in Asia, again, I think in Darwin we have this type of arrangement, which similarly is focused on being able to respond to different contingencies, being able to train and operate with additional partners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, even in other parts of the region here where we don\xe2\x80\x99t have agreements of this nature, we are able to do port calls, we\'re able to do exercises either bilaterally or multilaterally.\xc2\xa0 And all of this is putting in place an infrastructure of security cooperation in Southeast Asia that ultimately will support the stability and defense of the region.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about what impact you think that this may have on some of the maritime disputes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about -- East China Sea, South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 And you may not have been doing this because of China, but has China been concerned about this?\xc2\xa0 And what have you told them?\xc2\xa0 What have you sought to reassure them?\xc2\xa0 Finally, I also want to know what\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve done Darwin.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re doing this.\xc2\xa0 Is there another one on the horizon now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, your first question real quick was?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What impact might it have on maybe protecting --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Maritime disputes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think as a general matter we believe that -- again, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an agreement designed at resolving maritime disputes with any particular maritime dispute as a focal point of why we did this.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the presence of the United States in the Asia Pacific has been a stabilizing force for a long time.\xc2\xa0 We have made very clear that we believe that there should be a cooperative approach to addressing maritime disputes consistent with international law, that there should be an avoidance of an escalation of tensions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear we have an interest, a national interest, in for instance the free flow of commerce and open sea lanes. \xc2\xa0And having the United States present not just in this agreement but in the region more generally we believe provides a sense of stability that I think contributes to a security environment that avoids escalation and conflict.</p>\n<p>And so I guess as a general matter the U.S. presence in the Asia Pacific and the U.S. rebalance and prioritization of our defense budget here in the Asia Pacific is meant to continue our historic commitment to be a stabilizing force in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On China -- and Evan may want to come in here, too -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One is we\xe2\x80\x99ve also increased our military-to- military exchanges with China, in part to have greater transparency and in part to avoid any unnecessary and inadvertent escalation.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of how we approach these issues, that we have that type of dialogue and exchange with China.\xc2\xa0 The fact of these negotiations has been public and known in the region, so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that the Chinese have been aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Evan -- what was your third question?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xc2\xa0 Darwin, this, and now what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re modernizing each of our alliances.\xc2\xa0 So you have Darwin, which allows us to cooperate with Australia.\xc2\xa0 You have this agreement, which is going to deepen our cooperation in the Philippines, with Japan, the Republic of Korea.\xc2\xa0 With Korea, we\'re discussing the potential delay of OPCON transfer, but also how we can better meet our security requirements.\xc2\xa0 With Japan, they\xe2\x80\x99re going through a process of looking at their approach to collective self-defense.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also I think -- one thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated on this trip is trilateral cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the United States on issues like missile defense, for instance, is another priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is ASEAN cooperation is very important to us.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel just had a visit out here where he met with all the ASEAN defense ministers.\xc2\xa0 And our ability, again, to do joint exercises, to have ability to improve disaster response and humanitarian assistance, to have open dialogue between different militaries -- all of that I think is in service of the stability and growth of the region.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to point to a specific agreement, but across our alliances we\xe2\x80\x99re taking these steps.\xc2\xa0 But also, we\xe2\x80\x99re deepening our defense partnerships with ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 And that was a subject of the conversation today with the Malaysian Prime Minister, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an area where, again, we see a lot of common interests.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 On the last question about what\xe2\x80\x99s next, the way we think about it is our alliance commitments, our security partnerships are tied to the security challenges and the threats our allies and partners face.\xc2\xa0 And as those threats evolve, the nature of our alliances and security partnerships will evolve as well, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Japan or South Korea.\xc2\xa0 As the North Korean nuclear and missile threat has evolved, then our alliances have evolved.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s some of the great work that we did this week in meeting with Prime Minister Abe and President Park of South Korea.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, in Malaysia today, I want to highlight the joint statement that was released today and the fact that Malaysia formally joined PSI.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s significant.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been a good partner, but the fact that they formally joined now means that the opportunities for us to cooperate in countering WMD, especially related to interdiction, have increased.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the China question, Ben is absolutely right, we want a constructive relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 We have made a serious effort at improving our military-to-military ties.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s recent trip to China was a very significant success.\xc2\xa0 And whenever we travel in the region, one of the points that we make very publicly as well as in the private meetings is that we want all the countries in the region to have a constructive relationship with China, and we welcome them working with the Chinese on shared security and economic challenges. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your first question about the South China Sea, I would just underscore a point that Ben made that our position on this is very, very clear that we oppose the use of intimidation, coercion or aggression by any state -- any state -- to advance their maritime territorial claims.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that our work with our alliance partners and our security partners helps them become more capable and not being vulnerable to intimidation, coercion or aggression, we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why we seek to modernize our alliances and our security partnerships when we come here in the region.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in that context, I\xe2\x80\x99d highlight in this new joint statement that we released with Malaysia today there\xe2\x80\x99s a very substantial and very robust joint statement by the U.S. government and the government of Malaysia about our position on the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Malaysia is a claimant.\xc2\xa0 And very significantly in the joint statement, for the first time, they actually came out in support of the principle of international arbitration, which has been a subject of some diplomatic wrangling in recent months as the Philippines has sought to pursue an arbitration case regarding its disputes with China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the mechanics in terms of who is going to sign this and when?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be signed tomorrow morning between -- you want the specific person that\xe2\x80\x99s going --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, might as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 So our Ambassador, Phil Goldberg, is going to be signing on the U.S. behalf and I believe the Philippine representative is their Minister of Defense.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this will be before the President arrives?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some reports from Manila today that describe this as a 10-year deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year with a provision for renewing.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, finally, do you foresee limits placed by the Philippines on the type of weaponry that the U.S. can bring there, the types of assets?\xc2\xa0 For example, would they object to, say, nuclear-powered submarines coming there or nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on anything like that.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the scope, the duration and the location of our rotational presence in the Philippines is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working out with them in the coming weeks and years as we try to determine how we want to train and exercise together.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So a nuclear weapon -- this is more about, again, the types of air and naval assets, other assets that can meet the missions that we describe. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d just put -- without getting -- we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not getting into specifics, but those are the missions that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on, which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other words, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see this as a heavy-duty, even rotational or temporary basing there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, what it is -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement that allows us access to facilities.\xc2\xa0 And the size and the scope of that rotational presence will be determined by the mission sets and the training that is done.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to put a specific -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t quantify it because it\xe2\x80\x99s flexible to missions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you explain what the U.S. defense agreement with the Philippines, the Mutual Defense Treaty, commits the U.S. to in the event of a clash, for example, between China and the Philippines over disputed atolls?\xc2\xa0 Would it be fair to say that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go as far as what the President was talking about related to the Senkakus under the U.S.-Japan agreements?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, this agreement is distinct from that.\xc2\xa0 But the Mutual Defense Treaty again gives us a rock-solid commitment to the security of the Philippines.\xc2\xa0 That is a core of our alliance.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to some of the difficult territorial issues that are being worked through, again, it is hard to speculate on those, because they involve hypothetical situations in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 What we have said, again, is that we oppose coercion and intimidation as a means of resolving or advancing those territorial interests.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think the U.S.-Japan agreement has a very specific coverage of territory under Japanese administration.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the disputes in the South China Sea raise more hypothetical circumstances.\xc2\xa0 But, again, in that vein the defense commitment is rock solid.\xc2\xa0 Our approach to these territorial disputes is going to be to, again, oppose intimidation and coercion, and seek to resolve them through peaceful means consistent with international law.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, this is more of a staging agreement?\xc2\xa0 This agreement would not in the future allow the establishment of any kind of U.S. base in the Philippines?\xc2\xa0 And you said it\xe2\x80\x99s not about China.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what is it about?\xc2\xa0 What areas in this part of the world are you looking at from a security standpoint in the future?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s about Filipino bases.\xc2\xa0 So just as in Darwin, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t build a U.S. base.\xc2\xa0 This is about how do we cooperate on Filipino facilities and, again, what types of access would the United States have to those facilities to meet the missions we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re not building a new United States military base.\xc2\xa0 We are working together on Filipino bases in a way that we were not able to do before this agreement.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to China, again, we went through the mission set.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously, we have an interest in -- to go through them again -- the ability to respond to natural disasters; the ability to provide humanitarian assistance; the ability to counter piracy, terrorism, transnational crime, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- all things that are very fundamental to American interests.\xc2\xa0 And there have been challenges in this region with all of those elements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It also provides for cooperation on maritime security, again, which allows for I think a more stabilizing environment in the region.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a security environment in the Asia Pacific region, and insofar that the United States is able to work with allies like the Philippines, that provides, again, I think an element of reassurance about our alliance commitment.\xc2\xa0 But it also allows us to use these different relationships to work together with the nations of the Asia Pacific to meet whatever security challenges do emerge.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We say it\xe2\x80\x99s not about China in the sense that this was not an agreement that was reached to have a purpose of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might they see it that way?\xc2\xa0 I mean, they might see it that way, I suppose.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99d say to the Chinese is, number one, the Philippines is a treaty ally to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So the notion that we are going to have enhanced defense cooperation with them is completely consistent with a longstanding treaty commitment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Number two, the outcome that we want to see to these maritime disputes, including in the South China Sea, is a situation where the United States is not a claimant, but those claims are resolved in a fair matter consistent with international law that China has an interest in stability in the region rather than an escalation of tension or conflict.\xc2\xa0 And so, therefore, they should not see a threat from America cooperating with allies and partners, precisely because our intent is to provide for a stable environment and to support the peaceful resolution of differences, and international law views all nations equally, big or small.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the outcome we seek not as a claimant, but as an Asia Pacific nation.</p>\n<p>And, again, we have a very regular dialogue with the Chinese on these issues.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a degree of transparency and the ability to communicate at the political and military level that can also help I think foster that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has China weighed in at all?\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, there are things that we disagree with China on that we cooperate on.\xc2\xa0 Do they see this as at all a hindrance to cooperation or something that would increase weariness on their part of an expanded U.S. presence?</p>\n<p>MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the Chinese having raised it with us.\xc2\xa0 They certainly weren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in any way, shape, or form in this negotiation.\xc2\xa0 This was about the U.S. and the Philippines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we do a different topic?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Anything else on this?\xc2\xa0 Mark, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Subic Bay is obviously a very fraught issue in the Philippines historically.\xc2\xa0 Can you guys say whether Subic Bay -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying exactly where you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do these agreements, but is that on the table as a potential place that American ships could go back to?</p>\n<p>MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of facilities on the table.\xc2\xa0 Subic Bay could be one of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more and then move to other topics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think there is going to -- this new agreement will have any impact on U.S. forces in Okinawa, Japan, where many Japanese -- American troops are stationed?</p>\n<p>MR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, the simple answer is no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have any effect on the U.S. presence in Okinawa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the news conference today it sounded like the President was suggesting that in conversations there were some lessons learned from the Malaysian plane investigation.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if you could put any more flesh on that.\xc2\xa0 Was the President speaking broadly, or are there two or three things either about future plane investigations or searches?\xc2\xa0 Just, was there more detail there?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 I mean, first of all, they talked about the ongoing cooperation around MH370.\xc2\xa0 But I think there was a discussion among the leaders about what lessons can be learned in a number of areas.\xc2\xa0 One, of course, is that when you go through a very complex recovery effort like this, you learn about what types of cooperation are necessary between nations.\xc2\xa0 So, again, when you have a situation like this where you have many nations participating, you have huge space that runs across many different territories, I think you learn about how to work together better to respond quickly in situations like this.</p>\n<p>I think with respect to aviation security -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not the expert on that -- but I think that people will take a hard look and see as we think through how we keep track of aircraft, what types of lessons can be learned in this respect as to the means by which we have the awareness around aircraft.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that they got into the weeds on this, but I think it was identified as an area where potentially we could take a look back eventually -- I mean, right now the focus is on the recovery -- and draw from this experience to get better at both aviation security and a response or recovery mission in future cases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last one.\xc2\xa0 Did the Prime Minister or any of his staff give the President any kind of briefing?\xc2\xa0 Or since the President has been briefed, as you said before, was he already in the loop on this?\xc2\xa0 Or was there any details or leads or anything that was talked about?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest a new lead.\xc2\xa0 The President has been briefed on this regularly.\xc2\xa0 He was aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I think what the Malaysian government -- the Prime Minister and other officials made clear is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep at this.\xc2\xa0 They said, look, this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hit the pause button on this.\xc2\xa0 As long as it takes, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to pursue this recovery mission.\xc2\xa0 But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into very specific notions of exactly what happened, for instance.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense if we know the sanctions, the new targeted sanctions could come as early as tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Can we say for certain they will go into effect tomorrow, and how that will be communicated, first of all?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give a specific time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that it could be as early as tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And the Europeans are also having a meeting tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated as that story evolves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Separately, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that Vladimir Putin has effectively cut off his conversations with high-level officials in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair way to assess it?\xc2\xa0 And when we heard from you a while back, the White House had said that they thought it was signs of progress that while President Obama had been initiating it in the past, now Vladimir Putin was initiating talks.\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s not initiating them now, what that indicates to you.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That report was wrong.\xc2\xa0 We had no indications from the Russians that there is a suspension of those types of contacts.\xc2\xa0 In fact, Secretary Kerry spoke to Prime Minister Lavrov earlier today, our time, so I\'m not sure what that was in reference to.\xc2\xa0 We hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had that indication, and the Kerry-Lavrov communication I think is a signal that we continue to have high-level discussions.\xc2\xa0 So we haven\'t had an indication that there\xe2\x80\x99s any formal change in how they seek to engage us at a high level.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 7:24 P.M.
