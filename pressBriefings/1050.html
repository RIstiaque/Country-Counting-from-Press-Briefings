PDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good day, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way north to Northern California, San Francisco, before we go to Denver.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have no lengthy announcement.\xc2\xa0 I just want to take note, which I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all have already, of the initiative that we announced this morning, another initiative to help put veterans back to work, veterans fighting valiantly and bravely for us overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan, returning home to find a very difficult job market, and deserve the assistance that we can provide to help them get back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is part of a broad initiative that includes the efforts through the jobs act, the tax incentives through the jobs act that would encourage businesses to hire veterans, includes the initiative announced last week by the First Lady and the President during the President\xe2\x80\x99s bus tour that is a program with I think 270 businesses that have committed to hiring veterans.\xc2\xa0 And today we have an announcement that would -- challenges community health centers to hire up to 8,000 -- to hire 8,000 veterans within the next three years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it required, or it\xe2\x80\x99s just a challenge?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge.\xc2\xa0 There are other reforms that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to prioritize in terms of physician assistant -- prioritize grants to universities and colleges that train physician assistants, for those that train returning veterans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another part of the reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m sure we have paper on this, and that pretty much exhausted my knowledge of details.\xc2\xa0 But I just -- making the point that the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment here to ensuring that our very deserving returning veterans find jobs is paramount for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, House Republicans say that they have a substantive veterans measure that passed with bipartisan support in the House, waiting for action in the Senate, and they\xe2\x80\x99re wondering why the White House wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work with them in a bipartisan fashion to get something that perhaps was even -- would reach more people, more veterans, and provide greater assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we are glad to work with, as we have shown in the past, Republicans on measures that put Americans back to work and grow the economy -- all Americans, including veterans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is simply -- it is simply indisputable that no matter what the Republicans say or tweet, the proposals they have generally put forward do not add to economic growth or employment in the near term, in the next couple of years.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t bore you by reading the analysis of Macroeconomic Advisers that came out yesterday on the latest Republican jobs plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, there are individual measures that we agree with them on.\xc2\xa0 For example, the free trade agreements, which have passed and the President signed, including -- as well as Trade Adjustment Assistance.\xc2\xa0 The patent reform bill -- we obviously support the repeal of the 3 percent withholding rule, which, by the way, was passed in 2006, signed into law by President Bush, and was voted for by Representatives Boehner and Cantor.\xc2\xa0 So we support working with them to get that done, and we believe we can.\xc2\xa0 The current pay-for in the House version is something we can support.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for areas where we can work with Republicans, because this is an all-front struggle to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is the urgent priority of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we still have not seen from the Republicans is a willingness to do the kinds of things that will substantially add to economic growth and job creation in the near term.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, the American Jobs Act, as you know, has been judged by outside economists, if passed, to add up to 1.9 million jobs next year and increase economic growth by 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 It is simply a fact -- and the Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t argue otherwise because they cannot -- that their proposals do not do the same thing.\xc2\xa0 In fact, at best, they do not materially affect economic growth or job creation that in the next -- before the end of 2012, and at worst they would actually cost millions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, individual provisions, happy to work with them on.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to urge Republicans in Congress to vote on the provisions of the American Jobs Act as they come up now in the Senate, because they are measures that Republicans have supported in the past.\xc2\xa0 And is it really adding -- for example, I believe it was 0.7 percent additional tax for millionaires and billionaires that they voted against 100 percent -- by Republicans -- and if that bill had passed and become law, 400,000 teachers and first responders would be going back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that these actions that the administration is taking unilaterally will substantially increase economic growth or job creation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it is absolutely the right thing to do for this President to take every action he can -- including executive action -- to help grow the economy and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced, both in the past and yesterday and today, and will be announcing going forward, are not a substitute for legislative action.\xc2\xa0 They do not -- being able to do these things that the President can do because he\xe2\x80\x99s President and has executive authority unfortunately does not make up for the fact that Congress -- Republicans in Congress -- are refusing to act on the jobs bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he will do them anyway, even as he continues to urge Republicans to act decisively to put people back to work and create economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm this student loan proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s already out there that\xe2\x80\x99s been reported?\xc2\xa0 And can you also talk a little bit about why, if the economy is such a big concern -- and this has been asked several times -- why not take up the pieces of the jobs bill that there is bipartisan support for, the payroll tax cut?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are things you can get done now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the first part, I can confirm that we will be continuing to announce executive actions, including on giving assistance to students to consolidate or otherwise assist them with their debt obligations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I can confirm that there have been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting on that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if it bears to be -- if it turns out to be accurate in all its details.\xc2\xa0 However, this President is committed to taking measures that he can, through executive action, to help students with their student loans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the second point, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go back to what I said:\xc2\xa0 Every provision within the American Jobs Act is the kind of thing that Republicans have supported in the past.\xc2\xa0 The pay-for in the American Jobs Act is broadly supported -- overwhelming supported -- by the American people -- Democrats, independents, Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo Republicans -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t the question to Republicans, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you support things that you supported in the past?\xc2\xa0 And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you support paying for those things in a way that is supported overwhelmingly by the American people?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear the answer myself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will be taking it up -- or the Senate is committed to taking up, Majority Leader Reid has said, each provision of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 That includes, of course, the extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut on the employee side; the new payroll tax cut on the employer side.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that Republicans will support those tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 They tend to claim that they support tax cuts in general.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome Republicans have come out and said they\xe2\x80\x99re not for extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 For some reason they think that raising taxes on the middle class is the answer to our economic problems in 2012.\xc2\xa0 We think the American people -- certainly middle-class Americans -- would disagree.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give a few examples of what other areas the President could take executive action in?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that would ruin the suspense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not going to comment?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the China currency -- on the China --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to let that go completely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you said repeatedly you need Congress to get some things done.\xc2\xa0 But what areas can a White House do things like this on without congressional approval?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated already -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in education, or through getting veterans hired, or saving hospitals and providers millions and millions of dollars through changes in regulations -- I mean, there are a variety of things you can do -- and we have done -- that have a positive impact on growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he will continue to do them.\xc2\xa0 And we -- he has tasked him team to continue to look for ways that he can take action as President -- take executive action -- on the number-one priority that the American people have made clear they want action on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s jobs and growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have done all these things over the last several months if there were options that were available to you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, there -- we had a debt ceiling crisis.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward his jobs act -- an American Jobs Act that, again, was deliberately constructed with elements that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support because he hoped -- and continues to hope -- that Congress will act on it accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything in his power, and he will continue to do everything in his power as President to take actions that help the economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Jeff\xe2\x80\x99s question, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry if I\xe2\x80\x99m repeating it.\xc2\xa0 But haven\xe2\x80\x99t you guys been doing this sort of all along, looking for executive actions you could take?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything new about what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing other than how you\xe2\x80\x99re packaging it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, every single idea is new.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, in philosophy, in terms of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly cynical to say it\xe2\x80\x99s about packaging.\xc2\xa0 Ask the 8,000 veterans who would get jobs whether that\xe2\x80\x99s packaging --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you misunderstood me.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I was saying.<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- or the folks who are going to be able to refinance their loans at a lower rate, their mortgages at a lower rate.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is a new thing to reduce -- to lift the cap on the amount that your mortgage can be underwater.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the answer to your question is, did we not have and implement every good idea in the universe on the first day that we came into office?\xc2\xa0 No, we did not.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to -- the President continues to task his team both at the White House and broadly in the administration to look for ways that the administration can act through executive authority to help create jobs and grow the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I think you misunderstood my question or maybe I misstated it.\xc2\xa0 What I was trying to say was you have all along been doing exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Each one has its own set of implications and import.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying any of these are insignificant.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying the idea that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to act alone to try to make a difference in various areas, is that new or hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the administration been doing that certainly for many months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration -- the President has certainly been taking executive action where he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate in a variety of ways, both to address economic growth and job creation and to address other issues of importance.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced today and yesterday, and that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to press forward on, all go to this issue of job creation and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And they -- we believe, coming as we are right now in a situation where Congress refuses thus far to act, Republicans in Congress refuse thus far to act on common-sense solutions to the problems of economic growth and job creation that are entirely paid for, that the President has to redouble his efforts to find ways through executive authority to take action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a substitute.\xc2\xa0 He is hoping that as Americans see him taking action through executive authority that they support, that members of Congress -- members of the Senate -- will see that and Republicans who thus far have refused to support common-sense solutions for the challenges facing us will perhaps change their mind and support, for example, the vote in the Senate next week on $50 billion in infrastructure as well as the $10 billion infrastructure bank.\xc2\xa0 These are, again, ideas with a long, long Republican pedigree -- a long, long history of Republican support.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope we\xe2\x80\x99ll see that next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hand in hand with the subject of gridlock, the Republicans continue to call into question the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, especially on the issue of the China currency.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Your Under Secretary of Treasury today said that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to push that at the upcoming summits in November, but -- push the China currency issue with regard to labeling the currency, the revaluing of the currency.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have throughout, from the beginning of this administration, made clear to the Chinese that they need to take steps to deal with the fact that their currency is undervalued.\xc2\xa0 Some progress has been made, but not nearly enough.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had those conversations with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve stated our views about the legislation that was in the Senate on China currency.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously -- leaders in Congress have also stated their views.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to consider it an important issue that we\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Chinese on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to Kate\xe2\x80\x99s question?\xc2\xa0 The administration continues to push for these measures that you say have bipartisan support, but the way of paying for them is not.\xc2\xa0 I mean, raising taxes on millionaires does not have --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it has broad bipartisan support everywhere except for in the Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But is it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the polls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve written about the polls --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Republican majorities support asking millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more so that Americans can go -- other Americans can go back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but the point is that aren\xe2\x80\x99t these the kind of political votes that the President himself has decried in the past?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re putting people on the record simply to bring it back up during a campaign when you can go straight for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 When Republicans complain about him doing this, we invite them to end their misery, pass the American Jobs Act and prevent -- deprive the President of the capacity of running against Congress as a do-nothing Congress.\xc2\xa0 He would like nothing more than to be deprived of that opportunity, because the number-one priority he has is the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, look, even if, as reporters tend to want to \xe2\x80\x93 understandably -- you want to look at this in purely political terms.\xc2\xa0 Americans overwhelmingly -- Democrats, independents, Republicans -- think that the number-one issue right now is growing the economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xc2\xa0 The President agrees with them.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously in his interest, both because he\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States and wants to do everything he can to help the economy grow, but also in his political interest for -- to take actions that help the economy grow and put people back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the Republicans have been offered the invitation, if they think this is about politics, to deprive him of the opportunity by voting on and passing provisions, again, that are paid for entirely and paid for in a way that their own constituents support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You touched on the student loan announcement, but do you have any information on what it is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific details for you.\xc2\xa0 I believe that there will be more details forthcoming later today, is my understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President lay out the details tomorrow in Denver?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- yes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about it tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He will?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you think Jay Leno went?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I thought it was great.\xc2\xa0 It was a lot of fun.\xc2\xa0 What was striking about it -- obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s embargoed, but it was a pretty serious interview and discussion, especially at the top, that I think was illuminating.\xc2\xa0 I enjoyed it.\xc2\xa0 How about you guys?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did as well.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- is it possible for you to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go through a Q&amp;A, break the embargo because that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something that was surprising to you that came up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just encourage -- I encourage everyone to watch.\xc2\xa0 I think it was a --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it was -- let me just ask this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was both a serious interview and a very funny interview.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was -- not even talking about the substance of it, but it was on serious subjects.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that it was an opportunity that -- I mean, do you think most Americans normally hear him talking about those kinds of serious subjects in the way that he was today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he spends a lot of time talking about serious subjects.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get enough opportunities to be able to be lighthearted in the way you can be with somebody like Jay Leno.\xc2\xa0 And I know he enjoys that.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the fact is Americans are busy, and they get their news and information in a variety of ways, through a variety of media.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in reaching folks where they are, and that includes through new media.\xc2\xa0 It includes shows like Jay Leno\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 It includes, obviously, traditional mainstream media institutions like the ones represented here.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- gone are the days where all you had to do was give a speech and assume everybody watched or listened or read about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he go on Conan?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President appeared on Letterman?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been on Letterman?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he has.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure as President, but I have to check.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Letterman is a fan of his.\xc2\xa0 Letterman is a fan of the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any announcements about future interviews or appearances.\xc2\xa0 Anything else?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right, see you guys in -- at our next stop.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:42 P.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
