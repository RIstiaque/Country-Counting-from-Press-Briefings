EDT</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0So it does look like we\xe2\x80\x99re heading to the rain site in Richmond, where the President is going to talk about a lot of the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about over the course of the last couple of days -- the direction that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking this country, what he\xe2\x80\x99s done to do -- what he\xe2\x80\x99s done to grow the economy and help create jobs, and the real stark difference between what his plans are and what Republican leaders in Washington want to do as it relates to tax cuts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President thinks that Americans should get tax cuts on up to $250,000 of their income. \xc2\xa0Republicans in Washington want to blow a hole in our deficit to the tune of $4 trillion in order to give tax cuts to billionaires and millionaires.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot of that today. \xc2\xa0And then, of course, as you saw earlier today, probably a wide variety of topics that the participants want to discuss.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So, with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a danger at all that some of these questions don\xe2\x80\x99t allow the President control of the conversations, that it\xe2\x80\x99s slipping out of your control?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, when the President ran for this office, he told Americans that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just going to be some canned President who went out, said two lines, walked back into the Oval Office and stayed insulated. \xc2\xa0He wanted to make sure that he was having a real exchange with the American people about issues that are important to them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what you see today. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about any variety of things. \xc2\xa0I think that from the reports that I\xe2\x80\x99ve read, people are still getting a sense of what the President is saying, what the President said yesterday in Madison, what the differences between us and Republican leaders in Washington are as it relates to their pledge on tax cuts on the middle class -- all those issues.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So is he as in control as he could be if he just stood in front of a room with a microphone and then just walked away? \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0But he enjoys the back-and-forth with the American people and the true conversation that he\xe2\x80\x99s having about all these issues.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0These are some pretty tough questions, right?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0They were -- there was a wide variety of questions. \xc2\xa0I think he handled them all pretty deftly.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It looks like Congress is going to adjourn without even passing a budget. \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that make it harder for the President to argue that Democrats are doing a good job of governing and deserve to be reelected?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0If you look at the track record of what Democrats have been able to do over the course of the last two years, nobody can argue that this was one of the most productive legislative sessions that Congress has ever seen.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On tax cuts, as the President said today, small businesses have already gotten eight tax cuts as a result of actions that this Congress has taken -- eight more as a result of the small business bill that passed just last week.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve moved at a pretty robust pace, and you can bet that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to do. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with -- the President will meet with Democratic leaders in Washington tomorrow and they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about a wide variety of issues and what we ought to do going forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why does he want to meet with them? \xc2\xa0What is the purpose of that meeting?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just one more opportunity to talk to some of his allies on Capitol Hill before they go out for the election.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99ll be Reid, Pelosi, Hoyer --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to get you a roster of those folks by the end of the day.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Tomorrow?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Tomorrow.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there anything in particular the President would like them to accomplish before they get out? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what the main agenda item is.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously already accomplished quite a bit, although there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to do. \xc2\xa0I think the most necessary function is passing a CR to make sure that the government keeps functioning until they can get back and pass all the rest of their bills.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So passing a CR is more important than having some sort of a resolution to all the tax cuts?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President would love to have a resolution to the tax cut issue. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been disappointed that Republicans have held middle-class tax cuts hostage so that Republicans can get what would be an average of a $100,000 tax cut to millionaires and billionaires across this country.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So the President desperately wants to make sure that we get resolution to that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time to get that done. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen here is exactly what Democratic leaders prescribe and they\xe2\x80\x99ll pass a CR and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to business later.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How can you say they\xe2\x80\x99re holding it hostage if the Democrats haven\xe2\x80\x99t even produced a bill to put on the floor?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the maneuvers and gamesmanship that Republicans in Washington have been playing with this issue. \xc2\xa0People are crystal clear on where the President stands on this and where Democratic leaders are and what we want to do. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to be fighting all throughout the end of this year to make sure that middle-class Americans get the tax cut that they need in order to keep this economy moving and to create an environment where we can be creating more jobs in this country.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any news on the chief of staff run?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Nope.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just real quick, you seem to prioritize the CR there above the tax cuts. \xc2\xa0Did I hear you correctly?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got some time on the tax cuts before they expire. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s less time before the government stops functioning.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President is comfortable with the tax cuts being dealt with in a lame duck?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President is comfortable with the tax cuts being dealt with in whatever way they need to get dealt with so that middle-class Americans can get a tax cut.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The commission is supposed to release its findings in that lame-duck session, too. \xc2\xa0Does the President still want some kind of vote on the debt commission\xe2\x80\x99s finding in the lame duck?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when that -- when a vote on their findings would happen, to be completely honest with you. \xc2\xa0But we obviously have about -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see here, it\xe2\x80\x99s October, November, December -- two months and change before they come back with what their findings are, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a determination when we get to that point.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because that was part of the deal that he got from the Democratic leadership, that there would be a vote in the lame-duck session before the next Congress.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Okay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are we going to hear from the President on the China bill in the House?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think the extent of what the President is going to say about China and their currency he said today in that Des Moines backyard.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President is going to be in Eric Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s backyard. \xc2\xa0Is he going to single him out today about his position on the tax cuts?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much better place in the country to go and talk about the real difference that there is in how Democrats think this country ought to go and how these Washington Republicans think this -- the country and the economy want to go.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a -- there couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a more clear contrast as it relates to their economic policies than where we are on tax cuts. \xc2\xa0Are we going to have huge deficit-causing tax cuts like we had throughout the last decade that caused the economy to move in the wrong direction, that caused us to -- deficit spend in ways that we never had before, and caused surpluses to turn to huge deficits? \xc2\xa0So you can bet that the President is going to focus in very keenly on Republicans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What do you feel like he\xe2\x80\x99ll accomplish this week on the campaign trail?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President sought to go out across the country to different regions, to different areas, to different backyards, to different venues, like in Madison, and talk plainly with the American people about what the choice is this November -- what the difference in direction that we could go after the elections.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 He wanted to make sure the American people knew that there were big stakes, that Democrats and independents and even the independent-minded Republicans who supported him in 2008 know that if they sit on the sidelines, if they stop doing the hard work that it costs -- that they have to do in order to keep changing Washington, to keep moving the economy in the right direction, then it could all fall apart, and it could have profound impacts -- a profound impact in the lives of the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 He did a pretty good job of that, and he also had a chance to really connect with Americans right in their own backyards.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s he\xe2\x80\x99s got for next week?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0We should have something for you more closer to the end of the week.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you feel like he made headway on the enthusiasm gap?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I mean, the only data that you can point to is public polling, and certainly the public polling suggests that Democrats are doing better in recent days than they have been recently. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that that is necessarily directly as a result of Washington Republicans laying out their Pledge to America, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been met with a pretty resounding -- with pretty resounding disappointment all across the country.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go back to the same policies that we had for the last decade. \xc2\xa0They want to keep moving the country forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And as people see what the choice is, as they see what the stakes are for them and their families, I think that Americans are choosing Democrats.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I had one -- do you have anything on the thwarted al Qaeda plot that was going to be on European and United States cities?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to discuss any specific plot against the United States. \xc2\xa0We obviously track and watch out for any potential threat to Americans. \xc2\xa0The President is briefed on threats every single day.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 In recent weeks, he\xe2\x80\x99s brought in his counterterrorism team, his homeland security team, and folks have been working through all the potential threats to make sure that the American people are safe.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And just today Secretary Napolitano is in Montreal attending an aviation security conference because we\xe2\x80\x99re working closely with our partners in North America and all around the world to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to effectively fight any potential attacks against our country or our interests.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you comment on reports that two senior leaders -- al Qaeda leaders, one in Pakistan, one in Afghanistan -- have been killed by drone attacks?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comments on those specific reports.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President seemed to struggle today talking to the -- the first question, the woman whose son is just out of school and having trouble finding work, and the father who talked about his 55-year-old parishioner who\xe2\x80\x99s kind of in the same boat. \xc2\xa0Are you all working on kind of a short -- not long-term structural answer for that question, but kind of what he finally got around to about staying hopeful?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, these are big, tough issues that the American people are facing. \xc2\xa0And the President likes these venues because he has an opportunity not just to spit out some 30-second answer or something that fits on a bumper sticker, but instead talk frankly with the American people about the challenges we face, what he\xe2\x80\x99s done to try to take them on, and what we still need to do to keep that work going.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to do that. \xc2\xa0You guys have all followed him since he got into politics. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start seeing the President talk in 15-second answers anytime soon.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You had great bumper stickers. \xc2\xa0Everybody loved you all\xe2\x80\x99s bumper stickers.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think they liked the picture -- the whole thing, Beyonc\xc3\xa9 singing. \xc2\xa0I think he went over that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When you talk about talking frankly, do you think that qualifies as straight talk?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to leave that to the pundits in Washington to decide.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you guys planning another round of backyard chats for the future after this swing?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0If I were you guys, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to see the President in some more backyards before the end of this year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you found -- have you hit on any final venues for the Moving America Forward rallies in Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Ohio yet?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0If they\xe2\x80\x99re picked, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about it. \xc2\xa0I would check in with the DNC on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will we be seeing the President and the First Lady on the campaign trail together?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Decent question. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Fink does.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.
