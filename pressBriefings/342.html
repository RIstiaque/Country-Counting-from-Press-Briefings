IST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just outline the top for you and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get started with the substance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to start with a quick briefing on some of the efforts that we have undertaken in the context of this visit to further engage the U.S. and India business communities.</p>\n<p>I have with me the Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, and the CEO of MasterCard, Ajay Banga, who are both going to talk to you about some of the activities that are associated with this event today.</p>\n<p>The second part of our program will be John Podesta, who will be here to talk to you a little bit about the announcement that we made back in the U.S. last night, which is some news related to ANWR.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll have some details on that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to take your questions on that.</p>\n<p>And then Ben Rhodes and I will stand together and be able to answer your questions on a variety of other topics that may be on your mind today.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to keep all of this to an hour or so, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to be efficient.</p>\n<p>So with that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I turn it over to Secretary Pritzker.\xc2\xa0 She and Ajay will have some comments at the top before they take your questions.</p>\n<p>Madam Secretary.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been an honor to be here in India with President Obama, and meeting with Prime Minister Modi both yesterday and then today for Republic Day.</p>\n<p>Our relationship with India has been a central component of America\xe2\x80\x99s rebalance to Asia, and in the last two days have demonstrated that over the years India and the United States have systematically forged an indispensable partnership that\xe2\x80\x99s about shared values and shared interests.</p>\n<p>But we have a lot of work to do, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to confronting the political and economic challenges together.\xc2\xa0 In particular, Prime Minister Modi and President Obama recognize the importance of deepening the economic and commercial ties that bind the people of our two great nations together.</p>\n<p>To mark this moment of renewed partnership, the United States and India are expanding the U.S-India Strategic Dialogue, which will now become the U.S.-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue, or S&amp;CD.\xc2\xa0 For the United States, this effort will be led by Secretary Kerry and me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This agreement establishes a framework that will strengthen our relationship and create new avenues of cooperation between our governments, our businesses and our peoples.\xc2\xa0 The new commercial element of our most important bilateral dialogue will focus on our shared priorities of growing our economies, creating good jobs, and strengthening our middle class.</p>\n<p>While we use this dialogue to produce concrete results, we will also use the dialogue to ensure that the United States and Indian businesses -- small, medium and large -- are in a position to capitalize on abundant opportunities that exist in both of our countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also use the dialogue to promote more trade and investment between our two nations.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also use the dialogue to identify new opportunities for economic and commercial cooperation that will improve the lives of both our peoples.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to use this dialogue to address the many strategic and political challenges that the U.S. and India must face together in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Modi and President Obama share the view that enhancing our commercial ties is critical to making our long-term vision of a comprehensive U.S.-India partnership a reality.\xc2\xa0 And that work begins today.</p>\n<p>Later today, we will have the U.S.-India CEO Forum.\xc2\xa0 And I know Ajay will talk a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also, in planning for this trip, put together something called the Infrastructure Collaboration Platform.\xc2\xa0 This is a mechanism that we\xe2\x80\x99re using.\xc2\xa0 As you know, India has put a huge priority in developing 21st century infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And this is an opportunity and a platform by which American companies will get early awareness of projects, and that the Indian government will help our American businesses and facilitate their way through the bidding process so that our bids don\xe2\x80\x99t get lost on the shelf, if you will.</p>\n<p>The other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is Prime Minister Modi asked the U.S. to have our companies focus on three smart cities, and we signed MOUs for three smart cities.\xc2\xa0 That will allow planning to begin to outline the specific opportunities in each of these cities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also going to resume discussions about how to approach the Bilateral Investment Treaty.</p>\n<p>All of these are indicative of a new day in the commercial relationship between India and the United States.</p>\n<p>Before I turn it over to Ajay, I thought you might be interested in knowing who the U.S. CEOs are that are participating in the forum.</p>\n<p>We have Dave Cote, who\xe2\x80\x99s the CEO of Honeywell; Mary Andringa, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of Vermeer; Ajay, who will speak with you in a few minutes; Sanjay Bhatnagar, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of Waterhealth International; Ahmad Chatila, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of SunEdison; Robert A. Iger, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company; Frank Islam, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman and CEO of FI Investment Group; Indra Nooyi, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo; Deven Parekh, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Managing Director of Insight Venture Capital; Vivek Ranadive, who\xe2\x80\x99s the owner of the Sacramento Kings and also in the IT business; Daniel Roderick, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of Westinghouse; and Arne Sorenson, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of Marriott.</p>\n<p>We also have a number of Indian companies, including Cyrus Mistry, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman of Tata Group; Anand Mahindra, who\xe2\x80\x99s the Chairman of Mahindra Group; Cyrus Mistry, Chairman, Tata Group; Dr. Vishal Sikka, who\xe2\x80\x99s the CEO of Infosys Limited.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a larger list that we can have the White House give you.</p>\n<p>Ajay.</p>\n<p>MR. BANGA:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Secretary Pritzker.\xc2\xa0 And good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and explain to you is what I see as what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with this relationship.\xc2\xa0 And if you go back to six months, which is when the first visit happened with Secretary Pritzker and Secretary Kerry, and then we had the Prime Minister come to the United States, and now this trip.\xc2\xa0 So in a relatively short time, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of progress, from the perspective of a business person.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the DSA sorted out. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got new announcements on foreign direct investment, on railways, defense and insurance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the beginnings of land and labor reform that are critical to expanding for all American companies.\xc2\xa0 And all those are great signs of the progress and the importance of the chemistry and the strategic relationship that she just talked about.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s good for us.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try and do in the CEO forum this afternoon is don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to come out there and make some large announcements of one company dealing with another company, or another business project here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the idea.\xc2\xa0 The idea is to be able to use the dialogue among these 25, 30 people in the room to help advance what could be stumbling blocks and what could be opportunities that this newly formed strategic dialogue that we are creating on not just the strategy but also the commercial aspect -- that\xe2\x80\x99s going to provide the vehicle for us to reach out on both sides of this methodology to both governments and both businesses, and make sure we make progress on the issues and really nail down the opportunities.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea of the forum.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not meant to make a specific announcement.\xc2\xa0 Having said that, investor mood around what\xe2\x80\x99s going in the U.S.-India relationship is much stronger than it was.\xc2\xa0 And my own company, MasterCard, in the last year has invested close to a quarter of a billion dollars in picking up two companies in this country.\xc2\xa0 More than 10 percent of my workforce is now in this country.\xc2\xa0 I do an enormous amount of development for mobile payments and for networking engineering and the like, out of this country.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the last year.</p>\n<p>And I think the opportunities ahead of that, not just for my company, but for all the other colleagues whom you heard the Secretary talk about, are tremendous.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m here for -- to help you understand that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s work to be done, and I think she said that very well.\xc2\xa0 And in my other hat as chair of the USIBC, we talk about the issues.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no hiding from issues, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of progress in a very short period of time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have time for three or four questions, if there are any out there.\xc2\xa0 Julie, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I had a question for each of you.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned, sir, in the meetings and talking through what some of the stumbling blocks may be (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 Can you just talk from a business perspective what potential stumbling blocks might be?</p>\n<p>And, Secretary Pritzker, have you had any opportunity to talk to the CEO of Westinghouse or other companies that might be affected by the announcement on the civil nuclear agreement yesterday and how they view this, or do they think that was done yesterday is enough?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken yet with the CEO of Westinghouse, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you any insight into his reaction.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have further opportunity for that conversation later this afternoon.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So Ben will be up here to answer some questions on this a little bit later.\xc2\xa0 Westinghouse I know has put out a statement today on this to talk about the deal.</p>\n<p>Ajay, do you want to take this?</p>\n<p>MR. BANGA:\xc2\xa0 Sure, a quick commentary.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that there\xe2\x80\x99s basic starting point impediments.\xc2\xa0 The first one is on taxation issues.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not really about -- the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve said they\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to get new retrospective tax actions is a very good sign.\xc2\xa0 We take that well.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot of pending cases.\xc2\xa0 And for a CEO and an investor having hundreds of millions of dollars of pending cases in your balance sheet is not a nice place to be.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99d love to get some resolution on those, love to see progress on the transfer pricing agreement and the general sales tax, the GST, which unifies all the taxes across the country, making it easier, by the way, not just for us but for Indian investors and Indian companies to do business in India.\xc2\xa0 It\'s useful for everybody.</p>\n<p>So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s progress happening in all of those and that\'s one of them.\xc2\xa0 The next big one is to move on with a conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to get covered through the intellectual property area.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of discussions going on between parties on both sides, governments and individuals, on how to make progress.\xc2\xa0 And India is looking at a new IT policy, and all we\'re saying is consult with investors and companies so when you do produce your policy it represents the best of both sides and the best of both ways of thinking.</p>\n<p>Then there\xe2\x80\x99s other stuff a little further.\xc2\xa0 This Prime Minister got elected on the idea of creating a million jobs a month and improving the quality of life of his people, and we think there are three ways to do that.\xc2\xa0 And U.S. companies bring capital, technology and IT people to help in all three:\xc2\xa0 manufacturing, tourism, and infrastructure.</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see from the list that Secretary Pritzker announced, the list of attendees at the CEO forum are actually a pretty good representation of all three of those areas in a way to advance that conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to ask the reservations the U.S. had on the U.S.-India civil nuclear deal, have they all been addressed?\xc2\xa0 And is the deal completely --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get to the civil nuclear deal when Ben comes up here near the end of the briefing, okay?</p>\n<p>Any other questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to get from both of you, if I may.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a number of different numbers that have been put out there, speculation about where this relationship can go and what it can mean for the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 Can I get some sense from both of you of what you think of this new direction; you think it could -- what it might mean in terms of investments, in terms of jobs?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the tangibles that may come out of this?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 Today you\xe2\x80\x99ve got I think about $100 billion of investment in -- Indian companies in the United States employ about 43,000 people, about $11 billion of investment.\xc2\xa0 And the opportunity in terms of investment in the United States is significant.\xc2\xa0 So tomorrow morning, for example, we\'ll have a SelectUSA event where we\'re meeting solely with Indian companies to talk about their interest and their impediments to investing in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Today, the conversation is really a two-way conversation about investment of American companies into India, as well as Indian companies into the United States.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say I\'ve spent 27 years in the private sector before I took this job; been in this job about 18 months.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve had the opportunity to travel to I think 27 or 28 countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 The momentum that has happened in the last four months between the United States and India as it relates to the commercial sector is really something very rare and seen maybe in one or two other countries around the world where we\'re interfacing.\xc2\xa0 And the intention of the leadership -- and you see it not just in the Prime Minister but also in the ministers who have to actually execute -- their enthusiasm, their focus, and then even in the areas of, for example, infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Infrastructure is ultimately local.\xc2\xa0 And in dealing with the chief ministers, which are the equivalent of our governors -- I\'ve met with several of them in cities where we\'re engaging in the smart city activities -- they are very focused on what can get done quickly.</p>\n<p>And they\xe2\x80\x99re also focused on the impediments, which is right now the financing.\xc2\xa0 We need to work on how there\xe2\x80\x99s greater municipal financing.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the Department of Commerce has offered to provide commercial law development programs to deal with issues like insolvency and other legal issues so that a municipal finance system can be put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there is enormous momentum and action happening.\xc2\xa0 And you hear it, as Ajay talks about what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, you hear us -- we talk about in very short order we\'ve been able to put in place mechanisms for us to identify actual projects.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a real focus on deliverables as opposed to just dialogue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ajay, do you have anything to add?</p>\n<p>MR. BANGA:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I could give you a couple of numbers to add to what the Secretary just said.\xc2\xa0 The first one is that when the Prime Minister was in D.C. in September, we had polled the member companies of the U.S.-India Business Council.\xc2\xa0 Only 25 percent of them is what we polled; just didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to get to the others.\xc2\xa0 Those 25 percent came back with between $40 and $42 billion of investment plans for the next three to five years in India.\xc2\xa0 Just one number as a sense of magnitude.</p>\n<p>The second one is current two-way trade between the countries is $100 billion.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, that\'s up a great deal, and defense is a shining star in that number, but I think that you could be looking at a really ambitious opportunity which could multiply it four or five times over the next decade.\xc2\xa0 And that would make us real trading partners of size, volume and quality.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the BIT conversation is so important.\xc2\xa0 India is going to become a large exporter of capital over the next few years.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just us bringing capital to India, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be both ways.\xc2\xa0 That BIT is in the interest of both sides of investment for making it work for both avenues of how we invest in each other\xe2\x80\x99s countries.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing we didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear very much during this trip was on intellectual property.\xc2\xa0 I think you touched upon it there, but how much did that figure into the discussion, especially as it regards the pharmaceutical industry?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PRITZKER:\xc2\xa0 That will be part of the conversations that occur tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll actually have a number of meetings with my counterparts tomorrow to begin to lay out an agenda, specific agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Intellectual property is definitely on the agenda, tax is on the agenda, land ownership is on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a number of things that we need to deal with.\xc2\xa0 And the Strategic and Commercial Dialogue now creates a vehicle for us to really address and resolve these issues.\xc2\xa0 One of the things we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to this afternoon from the U.S. and India CEO forum is really to help fill out that agenda.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I promised the Secretary she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be late for the CEO forum, so thank you for coming.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Banga, thank you for your time today.</p>\n<p>Up next, John Podesta, who is Counselor to the President, will talk about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge announcement that we made earlier today.</p>\n<p>MR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll change places in the world here for a second.\xc2\xa0 Sunday morning, East Coast time last night, the President announced via video that he intends to ask Congress to designate 12 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\xe2\x80\x99s Wilderness and Four Rivers -- in the Refuge and Wild and Scenic Rivers program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In connection with that announcement, the Department of Interior released a comprehensive conservation plan for the entire refuge after more than four years of extensive research, planning and public consultation.\xc2\xa0 This is the first time a President has called for the Coastal Plains within the refuge to be designated as wilderness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Since 1980, under the Alaska National Interest Land Conservation Act, oil and gas development is prohibited in the refuge.\xc2\xa0 But for more than 30 years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen repeated efforts and political battles over the Coastal Plain of the Arctic, in particular to open the area for oil and gas leasing.</p>\n<p>The 19.8 million acre National Wildlife Refuge is home to the most diverse wildlife in the Arctic, including caribou, grizzly, polar and black bears, gray wolves and musk oxen, more than 200 species of birds, 37 land mammal species, eight marine mammal species, and 42 species of fish call the vast refuge home.\xc2\xa0 Lagoons, beaches, salt marshes, tundra and forest make up the remote and undisturbed wild area that spans five distinct ecological regions.</p>\n<p>Simply put, the Coastal Plains, known by Alaska natives as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sacred Place Where Life Begins,\xe2\x80\x9d is too precious not to protect.\xc2\xa0 And while it is currently administration policy to prohibit the development in the Coastal Plains, President Obama believes that those protections should extend in perpetuity through a wilderness designation, the highest level of public land protection in the United States.</p>\n<p>Currently, less than 40 percent of the 19.8 million acres of the refuge are designated as wilderness.\xc2\xa0 That requires congressional legislation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is asking the Congress to do.\xc2\xa0 The United States today, of course, is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest producer of oil and natural gas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re importing less oil than we have at any point in almost three decades.\xc2\xa0 The administration continues to support oil and gas development, but there are some places, as I said, that are just too precious not to protect.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re taking these actions administratively through the conservation plan, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeking legislation to make those areas of the refuge that I mentioned permanently designated as wilderness.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99ll take any questions on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, John, is that carried through the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration at least if Congress does not act and then the next President would decide?\xc2\xa0 Or how does that designate --</p>\n<p>MR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the conservation plan will certainly carry through and will be in place.\xc2\xa0 The last time a full conservation plan was put in place was in 1988, so you do the math; it takes a while to do the studies and management tasking at the Department of Interior to create a new conservation plan.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been up to since 2010 and 2011.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re issuing their final EIS in conjunction with this announcement.\xc2\xa0 That will be final through a record of decision in 30 days.\xc2\xa0 It is open now to the public that those documents will be released, or will be released on Monday in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republican senators have vowed to fight this, and I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how confident you are that what you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing or what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is going to withstand that kind of political challenge.</p>\n<p>MR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, a number of the administrative actions, executive actions that the President has taken under existing laws and authorities that he has -- and I mentioned a couple -- have been opposed by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 I was hoping that a more balanced reaction would be forthcoming from some of the people who have commented on this.</p>\n<p>This is being done in conjunction with an aggressive -- for example, an aggressive leasing program in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska over the last several years under the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction.\xc2\xa0 The Interior Department has leased out for oil and gas exploration available tracts in that area, which is to the west of the Coastal Plains of the refuge.\xc2\xa0 The latest example of that was in November when 3 million acres and 270 tracts were leased for oil and gas development.\xc2\xa0 Conoco expects to start producing at a place called Colville Delta and the National Petroleum Reserve later this year.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to work with producers, including Shell, which is drilling offshore in the Arctic.\xc2\xa0 But the Coastal Plain, with its magnificent wildlife and its important place in the ecosystem -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the birthing grounds for the porcupine caribou -- is just a place that should be off-limits to oil and gas drilling.</p>\n<p>So we hope that we can find cooperation so that that wilderness designation ultimately can go through in the Congress.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the reaction that particularly Senator Murkowski had to this announcement was warranted.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work to try to find balance so that there will be drilling -- continued drilling in Alaska, and it\xe2\x80\x99s done in conjunction with the Alaska state lands that are being leased for oil and gas exploration, continued exploration in the Arctic on the offshore side.\xc2\xa0 But again, we feel very strongly that the Coastal Plains should be protected.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Angela, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 On a more local environmental topic -- the air quality, as we all know from breathing it for the last few days, is very poor right now in New Delhi.\xc2\xa0 Was that a concern at all about bringing the President here where the air quality is so poor?\xc2\xa0 And then on a bigger-picture note on that, is he optimistic that any of the changes that he and the Prime Minister agreed to yesterday will affect a change for the better in air quality whenever he comes back to India?</p>\n<p>MR. PODESTA:\xc2\xa0 I think we also saw this when we visited Beijing and made the joint announcement in Beijing.\xc2\xa0 But specifically with respect to coming here -- no, I think the President has traveled to many places where the air is bad for one reason or another.\xc2\xa0 I think in Delhi, I think particularly at this time of the year, the air quality deteriorates.\xc2\xa0 But I think we weren\xe2\x80\x99t concerned about bringing the President here for these meetings.</p>\n<p>Look, this has become an important topic -- the effect of pollution, including from the burning of fossil fuels, on the public health of citizens all across the globe, and it is true here in India.\xc2\xa0 I think the aggressive program that the Prime Minister announced and that we talked about, and talked about our ability to partner with India to help produce 100 gigawatts of solar power between now and 2022, is part of a shift across the globe towards cleaner forms of energy, which has benefits with respect to the climate and protecting against climate change, but they have enormous public health benefits as well.</p>\n<p>We also announced a new partnership that will be led by EPA to try to improve, through their megacity program, to try to directly work with the Indian government and the Indian people to both monitor the air quality in major cities in India and to try to begin to mitigate the effects of pollution.\xc2\xa0 So I think the shift, again, from dirtier forms of energy to cleaner forms is on its way across the globe, and it is being done in conjunction with tackling the problem of climate change.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, John.\xc2\xa0 So I just want to do two other pieces of housekeeping with you before I turn it over to Ben to do an overview of the visit here to India.\xc2\xa0 And then he and I will both remain up here to take your questions for a few minutes here.</p>\n<p>The first piece is that, earlier this morning, the President was briefed on the winter storm that is intensifying and approaching the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England.\xc2\xa0 The President received that briefing. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that White House officials have been in touch with state and local officials up and down the Eastern Seaboard to ensure that they have the resources necessary to prepare for and then immediately respond to the storm.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that, as usual, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has pre-positioned assets in the region so that they can assist state and local government officials who will be responsible for the immediate response.\xc2\xa0 I know that they also have already been in touch with these counterparts and the local emergency officials in many of these communities.\xc2\xa0 And the President has directed FEMA to keep him apprised of the ongoing situation, and to make sure that the resources that are necessary to respond to the storm can be provided, again, as I said, to the state and local officials who are responsible for that response.</p>\n<p>The second piece -- many of you have been asking about the logistics for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The President will give a speech here in India, as previously scheduled.\xc2\xa0 He also is scheduled to do an interview with Fareed Zakaria of CNN.\xc2\xa0 After that interview, that President will fly to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as all of you know.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule on the ground in Saudi Arabia is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re still working through with our Saudi counterparts.\xc2\xa0 We are working to make sure that there will be some press access to those activities for the pool that is traveling with the President.\xc2\xa0 We would not anticipate that there will be any sort of coverage opportunities in an open press setting, but we are working to make sure that there is some access that is afforded to the travel pool.</p>\n<p>After the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities in Riyadh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll fly out to Germany where we\xe2\x80\x99ll refuel and then return back to Washington -- not all that much later than had previously been scheduled.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a lot more details on the schedule, probably not by the end of the day today, but hopefully by tomorrow or prior to departure.</p>\n<p>With that, Ben, do you want to do a little overview of the India trip and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we covered some of this yesterday, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth stepping back and just going through the meetings and discussions that the President had with Prime Minister Modi yesterday.\xc2\xa0 They essentially spent the entire afternoon and evening together, and were together today at the Republic Day festivities as well.</p>\n<p>With respect to the meetings yesterday, just to go through the key elements of the discussion, the first working lunch focused really on strategic issues and where we can build cooperation.\xc2\xa0 An important topic of conversation was the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 India has an Act East Policy that intersects very well with our Asia rebalance policy.\xc2\xa0 And the two leaders talked about how we can cooperate more effectively in the Asia Pacific behind issues like strengthening rules of the road; resolving territorial disputes consistent with international law; strengthening cooperation among countries like the United States and India, but also working multilaterally with partners like Japan and Australia and the ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 And they discussed the relationship with China.</p>\n<p>Following that discussion, they focused on the security cooperation between the United States and India on a bilateral basis.\xc2\xa0 That includes the important announcements that were made yesterday about our defense relationship -- a 10-year renewal of our defense framework; also the initiation of, for the first time, for joint production projects.\xc2\xa0 Again, this will draw us closer together; increase joint exercises, exchanges.\xc2\xa0 Again, increased cooperation, both in terms of acquisitions and tangible cooperation on the defense sphere.\xc2\xa0 So we see the defense relationship as one that is growing here in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And also, the United States has an important export relationship and defense with India.</p>\n<p>In that context, the two leaders also discussed cybersecurity, and this was identified as an area where there can be increased cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Michelle had the question about intellectual property.\xc2\xa0 The cyber discussion came up specifically in that context with the need to protect intellectual property.</p>\n<p>Counterterrorism issues were discussed and the continued intelligence-sharing relationship that we have, and the law enforcement and intelligence cooperation that is very important to both countries.</p>\n<p>The situation in Afghanistan, the leaders reviewed, including India\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 They discussed the Iran negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And India has been a partner in the sanctions regime and has taken steps recently to ensure they\xe2\x80\x99re in line with their reduced Iranian oil purchases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And they discussed the support for democracy and human rights that are so fundamental to the U.S.-India relationship, and what we can do to lead by example and also to advocate for those values around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Then, in the economic sphere, they discussed a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 Of course they welcomed the breakthrough that was achieved on the civil nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 They discussed climate change and clean energy, which John dealt with.\xc2\xa0 And they discussed ways to continue to bolster our trade and commercial ties.\xc2\xa0 And they discussed the ongoing discussions around immigration reform in the United States where there are so many Indian-American and Indian immigrants.</p>\n<p>So it was a very broad discussion.\xc2\xa0 I probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t cover every single issue, but I think those were the key elements.\xc2\xa0 And again, we leave here tomorrow very pleased with both the tangible progress on issues like the civ-nuc agreement, the defense agreements, the clean energy cooperation, but also I think feeling as if space is open for a much broader U.S.-Indian collaboration on regional and global issues and on trade and commercial relations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The signal that is being sent from President Obama and Prime Minister Modi into their own respective governments I think is going to catalyze a lot of activity, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see where we can take this relationship.\xc2\xa0 It also sends a message to the world, I think, that the U.S. and India are going to be closer partners going forward.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the Asia Pacific region and building closer relations with emerging powers, particularly the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracy here in India.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there and take questions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 On this relationship, can you talk to us a little bit about what role chemistry plays in foreign policy?\xc2\xa0 Is it really that important that they like each other?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s critically important, Jim.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll put it this way:\xc2\xa0 The U.S.-India relationship is something that people have looked at for many years and thought this is a relationship that should go to a different level; that we have a lot of overlapping interests in counterterrorism and economic growth in the region.\xc2\xa0 We have a shared sense of values as democracies.\xc2\xa0 And yet, it was hard to get out of the old habits of mistrust, some of which are embedded in our own respective systems.\xc2\xa0 And it was hard, frankly, with all the other priorities that each country has in the world, to put in the time and energy into improving the relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happened here is Prime Minister Modi came to office and made a very deliberate decision to say the American relationship is a priority for me.\xc2\xa0 And then when the two leaders were able to spend time together in Washington and have very extensive discussions, I think they found that they had a meeting of the minds about where they were trying to go here; that a lot of the things that they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do in their foreign policies and within their own countries overlaps.\xc2\xa0 And so that opens up a space for cooperation.</p>\n<p>And I think what you get out of the personal relationship is, frankly, leaders say we can\xe2\x80\x99t kind of accept the status quo anymore, that we have to get things done together.\xc2\xa0 And they send that signal down into their systems, and that allows you to I think make the type of progress we did on the civil nuclear side, but also it creates a new conversation and a new space for trying to envision what the U.S. and India can do together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, when you talk about a much broader defense and security relationship in the Asia Pacific region, when you talk about how to overcome some of the economic irritants that have been a ceiling on the relationship, and when you talk about, frankly, what\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be a very difficult process leading into Paris of trying to achieve a climate change agreement, the ability to reach out and go leader to leader is ultimately what breaks logjams.\xc2\xa0 And having that close, personal relationship, that proves to be an important asset.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow, was the President at all uncomfortable at this parade for a couple of reasons?\xc2\xa0 Number one, he has a Nobel Peace Prize and in front of him was parading an hour\xe2\x80\x99s worth of weaponry.\xc2\xa0 And number two, those weapons were largely Russian and very few United States -- anything from the United States.\xc2\xa0 Did that make him uncomfortable in any way?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, on your latter part, the United States is quickly moving towards surpassing Russia as a defense exporter to India.\xc2\xa0 So that balance has shifted over years.\xc2\xa0 India obviously has a longstanding defense relationship with Russia, but our relationship is on the upswing.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re very confident in the increasing defense ties, even though we recognize there\xe2\x80\x99s a longstanding and legacy relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Which, by the way, is part of that context -- right?\xc2\xa0 It\'s a Cold War context.\xc2\xa0 That has been in the past part of the source of difference and mistrust between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 We\'re moving beyond that.</p>\n<p>But in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, look, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is not so much what is the particular float or military item that goes past the President in a parade; it is what is the system that is embraced by the country that the President is visiting.\xc2\xa0 And here in India you have the largest democracy in the world; they just had the largest democratic election that\'s ever been held.\xc2\xa0 And so they set an example to the world that you can be strong and you can have a growing economy and you can lift tens, if not hundreds of millions of people out of poverty through a democratic system.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what ultimately is important.</p>\n<p>Lots of countries have big militaries; lots of countries have military parades.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President is comfortable with is the fact that this is a democracy and that its strength, India\xe2\x80\x99s emerging strength is buttressed by those democratic values.\xc2\xa0 And that was part of their discussion yesterday, the fact that in today\xe2\x80\x99s world, the ability for two democracies of our size to be cooperating together sets a positive example.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one for Josh, if I could.\xc2\xa0 Just before you came in, Josh, there were local reports in Washington, D.C. that a drone -- a small drone -- penetrated the White House and the grounds.\xc2\xa0 Do you know about that?\xc2\xa0 And at this point, are any members of the First Family at the White House?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of those reports, Jim.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to follow up with you in terms of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the question?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The question was about there were reports that a small drone may have penetrated some of the areas around the White House, and so Jim was asking about the wellbeing and whereabouts of some members of the First Family.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any reason to think at this point, Jim, that the First Family is in any danger.\xc2\xa0 But we can certainly follow up on those reports based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve asked.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, you asked about the civilian nuclear agreement. Would you like to repeat that question now?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Just to get a sense of the breakthroughs you talked about.\xc2\xa0 Are they only in terms of the conversations and the reservations that you have had, or an actual deal has been worked out over the next concrete steps of the agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\'s the latter.\xc2\xa0 The two governments have reached an understanding, they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement about how to resolve the issues that have been I think a break and a logjam for the last several years.\xc2\xa0 So when you look at the administrative arrangement that we\'ve reached an understanding on, this will provide for the necessary information sharing and contact between the two governments, for us to feel like we can move forward in implementing the 123 Agreement.</p>\n<p>And then on the issue of liability, the Indians have put forward an approach in which they\xe2\x80\x99re creating an insurance pool, and committed financial resources to that pool that will mitigate risk for companies that are doing business here in India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in terms of the two governments, we believe that we have reached an understanding on these critical issues that have been an impediment to moving forward in the last several years.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it\'s ultimately up to U.S. companies to make their own determinations about whether and when to invest in India and to move forward.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw statements from Westinghouse, GE welcoming this step forward.\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'ll be consulting with them; the Indian government will as well.</p>\n<p>But in terms of the work that the governments have done together through a contact group the two leaders empowered here, we believe that this was a significant breakthrough and we now have the framework to move forward in implementing the 123 Agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, what is the agenda in Saudi Arabia?\xc2\xa0 Is it just to pay respect?\xc2\xa0 Does the President want to have a bilateral conversation with the new King that is substantive and on points -- specifically Yemen, but other regional issues?\xc2\xa0 And can you describe -- what is the understanding on information-sharing with tracing civil nuclear material that comes into India?\xc2\xa0 That was a huge stumbling point. The United States wanted to be able to track it; the Indians, for sovereignty reasons, did not.\xc2\xa0 They wanted it to be a more international construct.\xc2\xa0 What is the understanding on that particular point?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Major, the understanding is that the U.S. and India, through this contact group, have discussed mechanisms for information sharing so that the Indians are providing us with information and that we have lines of communication open that meet our concerns that we will have a sufficient understanding of how India is approaching nuclear security, how it is managing nuclear materials.\xc2\xa0 And again, we believe that that is sufficient for us to move forward with the agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s up in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So with respect to Saudi Arabia, principally, of course, the United States delegation, led by the President, is going to pay respects to the memory of King Abdullah, a longstanding partner of the United States, and also to meet with the new King, King Salman.\xc2\xa0 And I think, principally, I think this is to mark this transition in leadership and to pay respects to the family and to the people of Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m sure that while we\'re there they\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on some of the leading issues where we cooperate very closely with Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>And clearly, that would include the continued counter-ISIL campaign where the Saudis have been a partner and have joined us in military operations in Syria; of course, also the situation in Yemen, where we have coordinated very closely with Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries in trying to support stability inside of Yemen; and other regional issues in which the United States and Saudi Arabia often coordinate.</p>\n<p>So I think they\'ll touch on those issues and it will be a chance for us to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re in good alignment going forward where we have overlapping interests.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the King send a signal that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to continuity in terms of Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s approach to those issues.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think we\'re well placed to continue cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we also have very good relations with Prince Muqrin and Mohammed bin Nayef, two other members of the Royal Family who are a part of the succession plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, Ben -- on Yemen, the President said counterterrorism operations are continuing.\xc2\xa0 How does that work as a practical matter?\xc2\xa0 We no longer have a government providing intelligence or any kind of coordination on counterterrorism strikes, particularly drones in Yemen.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, just to echo the President, counterterrorism operations will continue.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that we\'ll take direct action inside of Yemen against AQAP targets.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something we\'ve done in the past.\xc2\xa0 I\'d anticipate us doing that in future.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve done so in coordination with Yemen.</p>\n<p>And I guess the way I\'d put it, Major, is, first of all, we have significant ability to develop intelligence and to try to track down terrorist targets that has built up for many years, and that, yes, draws on cooperation with Yemen and also our own intelligence assets.</p>\n<p>What I would also indicate is that we continue to have a broader relationship in Yemen that includes the security forces who we\'ve collaborated with in the past, as well as the political leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we want to see going forward is a political process that can restore stability.\xc2\xa0 And again, the United States is well acquainted with many of the different actors inside of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re confident that if we can get the relevant factions in Yemen into a discussion about restoring stability and a political process, that we\'ll be able to maintain the type of cooperation we\'ve had with Yemen and its security forces in recent years.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First is, (inaudible) -- have you see the reports about what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying in China on Chinese state television about that this trip is superficial.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen it, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t go through it all.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering if you could sort of respond to that, that they\xe2\x80\x99re kind of mocking this three-day, quick visit that\'s not going to be very (inaudible).</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s notable that they should feel like they have to go out of their way to comment on this visit.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- what I\'d say in response is I think the way in which the United States and India approach the issue in the Asia Pacific is very similar in the sense that nobody is aiming for confrontation with China or even to contain China.\xc2\xa0 Both the United States and India have very close relations with China in many different fields.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I think what you see in that the United States and India are committed to a rules-based order in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said in terms of how the United States approaches this issue is that we just want to make sure that all countries are following the rules of the road so that if there are maritime disputes, those are resolved peacefully, in line with international law.\xc2\xa0 And you saw that reaffirmed in the joint statement yesterday from the United States and India that we want to see not an escalation in the maritime space, but rather ways of resolving disputes consistent with the law of the sea and other international conventions.</p>\n<p>With respect to trade and cyber issues, the United States has made very clear that we want China to play by the same rules as everybody else.\xc2\xa0 And again, so these are not policies that are directed at China or aimed at holding China down, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what type of order all nations can thrive under in this part of the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, I just wanted to go back to the question you were asked about the parade.\xc2\xa0 The President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t uncomfortable with the parade.\xc2\xa0 Did he enjoy it?\xc2\xa0 Two hours is a long time for him to be sitting outside.\xc2\xa0 And then he had the tea with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Did they have other -- I know they had negotiations, but that sort of personal time, was he surprised that the Prime Minister showed up at the airport I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was supposed to be at?\xc2\xa0 So just anything you could shed on the personal interactions they\xe2\x80\x99ve had.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ve essentially spent most of the last certainly 24 hours together.\xc2\xa0 You saw them yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I guess one thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is they spent a lot more time one on one together yesterday than we originally had budgeted.\xc2\xa0 When they had tea and they spent some time walking together, they sat next to each other at the dinner last night, at the parade today.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve been having an ongoing conversation over the course of the last two days -- in their meetings, when they had their tea, at dinner last night, at the parade this morning.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Modi will be at the CEO event this evening as well.</p>\n<p>And look, they\xe2\x80\x99ve established a good rapport.\xc2\xa0 They also taped this joint radio address yesterday in which they took questions via social media from different people across India.\xc2\xa0 And they actually were able to discuss their backgrounds and where they came from, and the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that either of them would have ended up in the positions that they\xe2\x80\x99re currently in.\xc2\xa0 And they discussed, again, how that informs their approach to governing.</p>\n<p>I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve continued their discussions about their respective inspirations, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s from Dr. King or Mahatma Gandhi here in India and that common history, that common space that the two nations share.\xc2\xa0 But also I think putting forward their different world views and looking at the future of the Asia Pacific, the future of democracy, and how the United States and India can truly align with one another in support of those common interests and common values.\xc2\xa0 I think they have a lot in common in terms of their personal stories, but they also have a common view of where they want to take the relationship.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is what has opened the door to such progress going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, Ben, on Denis McDonough\xe2\x80\x99s appearances yesterday on the Sunday shows.\xc2\xa0 In one of them, I think on ABC, he appeared to accidentally name an American hostage being held by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 How did that happen?\xc2\xa0 Has the government, has the administration apologized to the family?\xc2\xa0 How has he dealt with it?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Ed, we are in regular contact with the families of Americans who are taken hostage overseas, so I think you can count on the fact that this is a very regular and ongoing series of conversations that we have with any families.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read out any individual conversation.\xc2\xa0 But again, we always go to every length that we can to make sure that families understand what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to try to bring their loved ones home.</p>\n<p>We do not comment on specific Americans because what we\xe2\x80\x99re most focused on is how can we best ensure that we are doing everything we can to bring hostages home rather than seeking to highlight an individual case, for instance.\xc2\xa0 So that will continue to be our practice going forward.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve said that there are still a very small number of Americans who are hostage, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to publicly identify and comment on individual cases.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be our practice going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On CBS, Denis said that we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 I thought -- in almost every time you come before a microphone, and when the President talks about this, he says we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get off a war footing.\xc2\xa0 He also repeatedly said al Qaeda was on the run, core al Qaeda has been decimated.\xc2\xa0 Are we at war with al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, Major.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us for years say that we are at war with al Qaeda and its affiliated groups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think you called me -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not laughing -- you called me Major, I think.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 FOX News.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in these jobs too long when I used to answer questions from Major when he was at FOX.\xc2\xa0 If I call Michelle \xe2\x80\x9cEd,\xe2\x80\x9d then I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a real problem.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We all look the same.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So, no, look we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with al Qaeda and its affiliated networks, that that\xe2\x80\x99s been an ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, frankly, rooted also in the AUMF that was passed after 9/11.</p>\n<p>And look, we have made great progress against al Qaeda core, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made this distinction many times that while we have decimated leadership ranks of al Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the emergence of different affiliates, particularly AQAP.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been uniquely focused on the last several years.\xc2\xa0 So that is how we approach it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think in terms of the permanent war footing though, part of this gets at what is the model and the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99re using to go after terrorist networks.\xc2\xa0 And what the President does believe is that we can do this in a way that does not involve the significant deployment of American ground forces.\xc2\xa0 And there, I think, we have moved off the type of war footing we were on when we took office and we had 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 That number is now under 15,000.</p>\n<p>But when you\xe2\x80\x99re still using force against terrorist networks, you\xe2\x80\x99re still using drones and air power against terrorist networks, and we still continue to train and advise and assist partners as we are doing in Afghanistan, this is still very much a war against this network.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the civil nuclear agreement.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Roderick is here today for the CEO summit.\xc2\xa0 Did he travel with the President?\xc2\xa0 Has he been part of any meeting?\xc2\xa0 Commerce Secretary Pritzker says she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him.\xc2\xa0 Has anybody else talked to him in the last 24, 48 hours?\xc2\xa0 Because this whole agreement is predicated basically on his company and one other company finding what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done to be satisfactory.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So over the course of the contact group negotiations, we do regularly have contact with industry to include GE and Westinghouse just so we have an awareness of their concerns and they have an awareness of the types of discussions we\xe2\x80\x99re having.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d describe it as a regular series of contacts with industry.</p>\n<p>Again, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they were at the table in the negotiation.\xc2\xa0 This was a government-to-government set of understandings.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear that we understand that each company will make its own decisions.</p>\n<p>In terms of contact with him in the last 24 hours, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any, but clearly we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the ability to see -- ability to see him tonight.\xc2\xa0 Their initial statement, again, welcomed this progress.\xc2\xa0 And look, I think what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to see is that there\xe2\x80\x99s follow-through, what does this insurance pool look like, and what is the investment environment here.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to share that information with them and to ensure that we are doing our best to advocate for our businesses.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to know that we believe that GE and Westinghouse would be a tremendous asset here in India, that there\xe2\x80\x99s no better companies for the production of nuclear energy, and that that can be a win-win for the United States and India in developing their nuclear energy sector but also supporting American industry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel with the President or with anybody from America?\xc2\xa0 He came independently?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he did not travel with us, he came independently.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to follow up on Major or whatever that guy\xe2\x80\x99s name is on Saudi -- (laughter) -- could you talk a little bit about why it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the President to go to Saudi this time when we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t typically go when foreign leaders or former foreign leaders pass away, with obviously the exception of Mr. Mandela.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s different about this that stands out?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of things that are different, Peter.\xc2\xa0 First of all, there actually have not been -- I\xe2\x80\x99m hard pressed to think of many close partners of the United States who have passed away in office.\xc2\xa0 The King was the serving head of state of Saudi Arabia, and so that is different than other circumstances where people who are former leaders may have passed away.</p>\n<p>So this is both marking King Abdullah\xe2\x80\x99s life and his partnership with the United States, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a period of succession in Saudi Arabia in which there\xe2\x80\x99s a new leader who\xe2\x80\x99s taken power.\xc2\xa0 And so this is an opportunity for the President to both pay respects for the life of King Abdullah, who he worked very closely with, but also to meet the new leader of Saudi Arabia and his team.</p>\n<p>And then of course we have many varied ongoing projects and initiatives with Saudi Arabia that are very important, including the counter-ISIL campaign, for instance.\xc2\xa0 So this is an area and a time where we\xe2\x80\x99re cooperating very closely with the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 And of course, the President was going to be in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And again, given that he knew he was going to be here in India already, it was certainly appropriate for him to stop in Saudi Arabia on his way back to the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he met with King Salman before?\xc2\xa0 Have they met a lot?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 They met.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly met in the past, but certainly not at the same extent as King Abdullah.\xc2\xa0 And so this is a good opportunity for them to sit down and exchange views and initiate the relationship as a leader-to-leader context.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I thought of one example actually.\xc2\xa0 Remember the President -- was it the President or Prime Minister of Poland that was killed in the plane crash --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- early in the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure.\xc2\xa0 And we did make plans for the President to attend that funeral but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t because of the volcanic ash cloud.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good example, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So there is a precedent of world leaders dying while they\xe2\x80\x99re in office and the President at least making the effort to try to participate in their memorial service.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That was a -- I forgot about the volcanic -- yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Isaac.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of things on Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 Was the President the one who made the decision to go to Saudi Arabia?\xc2\xa0 Was that his call?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It was the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in the Paris decision, so this was his decision?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, but, again, I understand the comparison people have drawn to this.\xc2\xa0 But first of all, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we regret that we were unable to send somebody of a more senior level than was represented in Paris.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And at the same time, here I think what you see is it\xe2\x80\x99s a different type of circumstance and that you have a turnover of a government, and you have I think a period of time where different leaders are able to pass through Saudi Arabia to pay their respects and to meet the new King.\xc2\xa0 So there is a difference, although it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that we made very clear that we believe it would have been good to send someone of a more senior rank.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just two issues I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if they will come up when the President meets with the King.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Iran and the negotiations going on over the nuclear program, and the floggings of the blogger Raif Badawi.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the U.S. is going to pressure Saudi Arabia to stop?\xc2\xa0 Or is that -- are either of those on the agenda do you think for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have a set agenda as we would if it was a bilateral summit.\xc2\xa0 As a general matter, we regularly consult with our Gulf partners -- Saudi Arabia and the UAE and others -- about the ongoing negotiations of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 So I would expect -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly likely that the topic of Iran will come up.</p>\n<p>And separately, human rights is a topic that we raise regularly with Saudi Arabia, so generally that is something that is on our bilateral agenda.\xc2\xa0 Without knowing exactly what the extent of the meetings and consultations will be and what the precise agenda will be, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to individual cases.\xc2\xa0 But I think it will certainly be the case that human rights will be on the agenda with Saudi Arabia going forward, and we raise these types of individual case with Saudi Arabia on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask one last one?\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question about Denis McDonough yesterday, did he make a mistake by saying the hostage\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xc2\xa0 Was that the Chief of Staff making a mistake?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we do not believe that it helps for the names of individual hostages to be in public.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for Denis, but I mean, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re being very forthright in saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s constructive to securing their release.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to guide us on this going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The only other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is that we do take a very personal interest in these people in the White House.\xc2\xa0 We know who they are.\xc2\xa0 In some instances people are in touch with their families.\xc2\xa0 And this is true not just in ISIL cases but with respect to Americans detained in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And so I think sometimes people have a personal interest in those issues and that, I think, informs how their thinking about them at any given time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just very quickly on the Civil Nuclear Agreement -- being able to get past one of the big points of the impasse, the tracking of nuclear materials, would you say that was more of a movement on the Indian side in providing more information that we wanted, or more movement on the U.S. side in accepting what they were offering?\xc2\xa0 And on ISIS, is there a chance that India would ever join the coalition?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So on the first question, I think the Indians certainly came to the table with increased information-sharing and exchanges that met our concerns.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is a contest of wills, but I do think that it was important for these additional understandings to be worked out in terms of increased information-sharing and understanding of how information will be provided, and also this insurance pool that could mitigate risk.\xc2\xa0 I think these are concepts that were fleshed out over the course of the last three meetings of this contact group.</p>\n<p>So we appreciate the leadership that Prime Minister Modi showed in getting this done, building on the work of the previous government but, again, enabling us to get over the hurdle.\xc2\xa0 But we also wanted to find a way through this.\xc2\xa0 And so we wanted to reach an understanding that was acceptable to both countries to allow us to move forward with the agreement and our broader relationship.</p>\n<p>In terms of the ISIL campaign, the fact of the matter is, number one, I think given ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s location, we\xe2\x80\x99ve principally been focused on -- certainly in our military operations -- Europe and Arab partners who can contribute.\xc2\xa0 In terms of our cooperation with India, it has been very focused in this part of the world and the different terrorist organizations that operate here in South Asia, be it al Qaeda, be it LeT, or others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, we do think there is space for cooperation with India on issues like foreign fighters, on issues like terrorist travel and financing.\xc2\xa0 That could be very relevant to the ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 So when you look at our broader counterterrorism cooperation and how we\xe2\x80\x99re tracking the flow of fighters and terrorist financing, there I do think we want to find space for cooperation.\xc2\xa0 That will look very different from a country that is providing military resources or training forces on the ground, but it\xe2\x80\x99s still a valuable contribution in terms of counterterrorism.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, you said the President and the Prime Minister talked about immigration reform in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So one of the things that Indian firms want -- (inaudible) -- is that something that the two of them talked about?\xc2\xa0 What else did they talk about on that issue?\xc2\xa0 And on the nuclear issue, there have been some reports that the insurance pool would be in $122 million.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that we put a specific dollar amount on the insurance pool so let me -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on that if we can confirm a specific number.\xc2\xa0 But again, this would be a substantial amount of resources that would have support from the Indian government and other entities here within India.</p>\n<p>With respect to -- your first question was immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So the Indian government raised the issue, as they regularly do.\xc2\xa0 And that does include -- it usually does include the H-1B visa issue.\xc2\xa0 And Indians are working in the high-tech sector in the United States, as well as broader India presence in the United States, people who are there on a temporary basis working.\xc2\xa0 And I think what the President indicated is this is the type of issue that we have approached through the context of comprehensive immigration reform and so, given his ongoing efforts to work with Congress in pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, we would be incorporating these types of issues in that process and would be in touch with the Indian government as that moved forward.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll go to Chris and Roberta, and we\'ll wrap it up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on what you said about the signals that was sent to respective governments in a world by this relationship.\xc2\xa0 We know that Prime Minister Modi puts a lot of stock in some of these symbolic things and there was a lot of commentary in Indian media today.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if in particular there was a particular signal that you think that these last 24 hours, 36 hours have sent to Russia and China, in particular?\xc2\xa0 And if I can ask Josh, since Jim asked the question -- I saw you checking your BlackBerry -- are you aware of anything about these reports of the drone?\xc2\xa0 Do you know if something has landed at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you answer the first one, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check my BlackBerry again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think the signal that is important in the region, and Asia broadly, is that, number one, the United States and India are committed to increasing our cooperation and elevating our relationship.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a very deliberate decision that has been taken by both President Obama and Prime Minister Modi, and that will manifest itself in different areas\xc2\xa0 -- defense, economic, political cooperation.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think that both leaders I think are very clear that that cooperation is going to be focused in the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 So you saw yesterday a joint vision statement related to the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the only region that we addressed in that nature.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we\'ve articulated a rebalanced Asia; India has articulated an Act East policy, which is very similar, integrating them in Asia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'ll give you actually an anecdote I think that illustrates this.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Modi said yesterday to the President, when we look to America we don\'t look to the West, we look to the East.\xc2\xa0 And I think the point is that he sees us more present in this region and he sees this as a space where we\'re going to cooperate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, the fact of the matter is the purpose of that cooperation is to ensure stability in this part of the world, to ensure balance in this part of the world, so that all nations feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s a level playing field,; that trade disputes can be resolved fairly; that maritime disputes can be resolved fairly and peacefully, in line with international law; that you don\'t have a situation where bigger nations can bully smaller ones, but you\'re working cooperatively.</p>\n<p>And for instance, when President Obama took office, the East Asia Summit that he attends did not exist.\xc2\xa0 This is a grouping that brings together not just the United States and the 10 Southeast Asia nations and China and Japan, but also, importantly, it brings in India.\xc2\xa0 Because we want India at the table.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the region is more stable when the United States and India are at the table with the different Asian countries working through these issues.</p>\n<p>So I think the signal is that we\'re going to be present here, were going to be cooperating with India here.\xc2\xa0 We share a set of common interests and values in this part of the world.\xc2\xa0 And again, with respect to China, I think that signal -- it\'s not a hostile approach, but it\'s rather one in which we have two very big countries that are committed to upholding a rules-based way of doing business here in Asia, and I think that can be a stabilizing force going forward.</p>\n<p>With respect to Russia, again, India has a longstanding relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 I think the signal -- the most important signal that can be sent is that democracy ultimately delivers benefits for people; that the United States and India, as the two largest democracies in the world, have thriving economies, have a very bright future, and that ultimately if you\'re playing by the rules internationally and respecting the rights of your citizens, that\'s how you succeed and get ahead.</p>\n<p>And what we\'ve seen in Russia, unfortunately, is the opposite, whereby you have a nation that is violating the rules of the road, that is violating the sovereignty of its neighbor, and that too often is not upholding those rules of the road.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, India will continue to have relations with Russia, but we believe that it\'s important for us to be representing democratic values.\xc2\xa0 And again, we\'re proud that we\'re increasing our cooperation with India in a lot of areas, but we\'re not doing that in an effort to push anybody else out of India.\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing that because we believe it\'s in our interest and in India\xe2\x80\x99s interest.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just on your question about the device.\xc2\xa0 There is a device that has been recovered by the Secret Service at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Early indications are that it does not pose any sort of ongoing threat right now to anybody at the White House.\xc2\xa0 But as the Secret Service has more information about their investigation about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to learn about this they\xe2\x80\x99ll share more information on this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have any information about what that device is specifically, or where it was, or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know these are all legitimate questions, and we\'ll see if we can work with the Secret Service to provide more information to you on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the grounds of the White House, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s my understanding.</p>\n<p>Roberta, I promised you the last question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Russia and the importance of following the rules of the road and respecting the sovereignty of neighbors.\xc2\xa0 Did President Obama bring that up to Prime Minister Modi and sort of make the case that maybe you should be more supportive or be supportive of the sanctions that we have against -- that the United States and its allies have against Russia?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 They touched on the issue of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The President I think did articulate the importance of upholding the basic principles of the international system -- respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0 But he did not seek India\xe2\x80\x99s support for sanctions, for instance.</p>\n<p>We recognize it\'s generally not an approach that India has taken to not just its relations with Russia but generally to foreign relations in terms of joining those types of sanctions efforts.\xc2\xa0 Although, on Iran, they have been helpful.\xc2\xa0 We focus much more on cooperation with our European allies on that front.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to see if the two leaders agreed to cooperate on specific initiatives to work on that specifically, like increased presence in the region in the waters, or more training exercises?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, principally, when we look at things like exercises and that type of collaboration, we\'ve been focused on the Indian Ocean.\xc2\xa0 But the South China Sea came up in the context of our support for resolving maritime disputes peacefully.\xc2\xa0 That includes ASEAN\xe2\x80\x99s negotiation of a code of conduct with China on the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 It also includes the way in which claims are resolved.\xc2\xa0 And you saw I think the leaders express support for the notion that claims should be resolved consistent with international law like the Convention on the Law of the Sea.\xc2\xa0 So that I think the broader context for the South China Sea disputes came up.</p>\n<p>I think the other thing that came up was the importance of cooperation with different important countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned before about, for instance, the ability of the United States and India and Japan and Australia to work together on these sorts of issues.\xc2\xa0 So they discussed the context for many of the tensions in the region, including the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 I think with respect to joint exercises, the Indian Ocean has been a focal point.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for your time.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:16 P.M. IST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
