Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:40 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you all this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before I get to your questions, I do want to acknowledge one member of our staff, Bernadette Meehan.\xc2\xa0 Today is her last day at the White House.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s been serving at the National Security Council for three years -- about the last year, in her current role.\xc2\xa0 And I think many of you have all had the same kinds of observations that I have, which is that she is passionate about her work here but also extremely diligent and responsive.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as I had the opportunity to convey to Bernadette in a more private setting, we are going to miss her not just because of her skill and talent and experience and knowledge, but also because of the way that she does her job.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily courteous and professional and collegial.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss her, but we wish her very well in her future endeavors.\xc2\xa0 And her future employers are going to be very lucky to have her.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, Bernadette, we wish you well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur best to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. MEEHAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s taking her place?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have news on that soon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask about trade.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Pelosi just recently said that the pro-trade forces shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count on more Democrats coming onboard than the about 18 who have declared themselves publicly, and urged Speaker Boehner to come up with the remaining 200 votes.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that assessment?\xc2\xa0 And is he pretty much stuck at that number?\xc2\xa0 And why can\xe2\x80\x99t he get more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there is no one who is a better, more effective and more accurate vote counter on Capitol Hill than Nancy Pelosi.\xc2\xa0 So I would have no reason to disagree with her assessment.\xc2\xa0 That said, the President is also a pretty determined advocate for the most progressive trade legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s ever moved through the Senate and he believes that there is ample reason why Democrats in the House should vote for it.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to make the case that they should, primarily because of the likelihood that it would expand economic opportunity for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And that is, after all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top domestic priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that I would say about this -- and this goes more directly to Mrs. Pelosi\xe2\x80\x99s comments -- Speaker Boehner, shortly after the election, indicated that advancing trade legislation was one of the top items on his domestic policy agenda.\xc2\xa0 And he, working closely with other Republicans, worked hard in the last election successfully, to their credit, to expand their majority in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And we would expect that he would use that substantial majority to mobilize substantial support for the items that are high on his agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think as the Speaker indicated in his news conference earlier today, he had an opportunity to speak to the President about this specific issue just yesterday, and that is an indication that Democrats and Republicans may be able to seize on some common ground here, advocate within their parties for legislation that both the President and the Speaker of the House believe would be clearly in the best interest of the U.S. economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our strategy moving forward will be to continue to make the case to members of Congress on the merits of this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s talk of this vote coming up as early as next week.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any qualms about it being that soon?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that the votes need to be secured -- more Democratic votes be secured before that vote?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it will be the responsibility of the Speaker to determine when the vote should take place.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that whether that vote takes place next week or the week after, the President will aggressively advocate for the passage of this bill right up until the vote occurs.\xc2\xa0 And I assume the Speaker of the House will do the same thing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, we feel very good about the merits of this argument -- that this legislation would write in enforceable labor and environmental standards, provisions that have not previously been included in a trade legislation; that it would have an impact in raising standards related to human rights among the member nations who are taking part in this agreement, and that there are ample reasons why progressive Democrats would support it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe saw about a third of the Democrats in the Senate support this legislation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a percentage that\xe2\x80\x99s that high in the House, but it is an indication that there are ample reasons for Democrats to support this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That gets to another question.\xc2\xa0 In 2002, the last time that there was a successful vote on TPA, there were 22 -- 21 or 22 Democrats in the House who voted in favor of it and there was a Republican President at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Why is it so difficult for this President to even achieve that number this time around?\xc2\xa0 Have the dynamics of trade changed so much that it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult for a Democrat?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Jim, what the President has acknowledged is that there is in the Democratic Party, reflexive opposition to trade legislation, that many Democrats do look back on recent trade agreements that have been negotiated with some concern about the impact that that has had on some segments of the economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why the President has sought to learn the lessons from those previous agreements.\xc2\xa0 And many Democrats point to NAFTA as evidence that trade policies do not benefit American workers, and the President, I think, made a pretty persuasive case in the NPR interview that he did yesterday that the agreement that he\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating with these other Asia Pacific countries, including Mexico and Canada, would write in enforceable labor standards, would write in enforceable environmental standards, would include important human rights protections, would include greater protections for intellectual property.\xc2\xa0 And these kinds of agreements structured in that way would start to put upward pressure on other countries to come into -- come closer at least to the standards that are enforced in this country in a way that will emphasize, underscore the kinds of opportunities that are unique here in the United States.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHere in the United States we have the most dedicated and educated workforce in the world.\xc2\xa0 We have the most aggressive and ambitious entrepreneurs and innovators.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got tremendous infrastructure in this country -- infrastructure that would benefit from some modernization, but still, infrastructure that does support a thriving economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also got a business climate that makes the United States the envy of the world.\xc2\xa0 The President often cites the statistic about when global investors are asked which country they\xe2\x80\x99re most interested in investing in, the United States is now at the top of that list.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the case that the President makes is that if we leave the rules where they are today we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to leave in place a system that Democrats complained have disadvantaged American workers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why the President wants to go back and change those rules in a way that will start to make the United States even more competitive when it comes to competing for business in the international community -- particularly in the Asia Pacific, which is the most economically dynamic region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, one of the things that Leader Pelosi said was that the TAA component, trade assistance component, of the legislation, is a non-starter because it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for with Medicare savings.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that a lot of Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to vote for either.\xc2\xa0 Does that complicate the equation for you guys?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously what we have been focused on is making sure that the size of the trade adjustment assistance legislation is sufficient.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that a lot of the assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s included in that bill goes toward things like job training and investments in our workforce that are going to be critical not just to the success of middle-class families and workers all across the country, but will benefit our broader economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are always debates in Congress among Democrats and Republicans about the best way to pay for things.\xc2\xa0 And approaching these challenges in a fiscally responsible way is something that the President has made a priority.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s always the subject of extensive debate and discussion and occasionally brinksmanship in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 So hopefully that brinksmanship won\xe2\x80\x99t occur in this situation, but that we can resolve those differences and pass trade adjustment assistance that certainly the President and the vast majority of Democrats believe would be good for our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoberta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How confident is the President that Speaker Boehner is going to be able to deliver those 200 or so votes?\xc2\xa0 Was Speaker Boehner able to give the President any assurance during that call?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any color on that call at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details from their conversation to share at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I think what should be clear by now is that this is an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives to do something that the President has frequently challenged them to do, which is to not allow the difference of opinion over one issue to become a deal breaker for all the others.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the fact is there are many areas where we disagree, but the President and some Democrats in the House of Representatives agree with the vast majority of Republicans that the Trade Promotion Authority -- that legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s passed the Senate is in the best interest of the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully Democrats and Republicans will be able to work together to pass it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how worried is the President, though, that Speaker Boehner is not going to be able to corral his caucus to deliver that sort of support?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been candid that it will be politically challenging to advance this legislation through the House.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that because this is a -- that because Speaker Boehner himself has indicated that this is a top priority of his -- I think it should be obvious to all of you that this is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got our work cut out for us.\xc2\xa0 And both the Speaker and the President believe that it\'s worthy of the time and investment to try to get this legislation across the finish line.\xc2\xa0 And the President has already devoted significant time to getting that done, and as I mentioned to Jim, he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that right up until the deadline of the vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Senator Shelby today, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that he won\xe2\x80\x99t take up the reauthorization bill for Ex-Im, and he said he\xe2\x80\x99ll decide in a week or so whether to go ahead with the reform plan or craft a reform plan of his own.\xc2\xa0 But I\'m wondering whether the White House has accepted now that authorization for Ex-Im is going to lapse, and what contingency plans are in place for Ex-Im?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly have not accepted that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve frequently made the vigorous case that the Ex-Im Bank has important benefits for the U.S. economy and for workers all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And there seems to be widespread bipartisan agreement about that, even if -- Chairman Shelby\xe2\x80\x99s comments notwithstanding.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to make that case, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the economic benefits associated with the Ex-Im Bank will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are contingency plans being crafted in case that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any.\xc2\xa0 There may be some people who are talking about that.\xc2\xa0 But our focus continues to be on securing legislation and reauthorizing the Bank in advance of the deadline.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you just mentioned that the President is going to aggressively advocate for this, and you stated the position on how this would be different than past agreements many times.\xc2\xa0 But when you look at the tactics on the other side of the argument -- the extreme pressure on Democrats, petitions with millions of signatures and things like that -- I mean, these campaigns that labor has put out -- do you feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s really any going up against moves like that?\xc2\xa0 And how do you try to counter that kind of pressure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We successfully countered that pressure in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, we got about a third of Democrats in the United States Senate to consider this legislation absent any sort of political motivation and to evaluate whether or not this bill would be good for the economy.<br/>\n\tAnd again, that means overcoming the reflexive opposition of a lot of Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But it also means focusing on the challenge that the United States Congress has before them.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has talked about this quite a bit -- more broadly about the economy -- when it comes to the Congress actually taking steps that will lay a foundation that will allow the private sector to grow and thrive and benefit middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And again, right now the rules -- if you listen to Democrats, what they say is, if you look at the way the rules are written now, they put some American workers at a disadvantage and it has laid a path for some companies to ship their operations overseas.\xc2\xa0 And the President basically has adopted an approach that says let\xe2\x80\x99s go change those rules then. Let\xe2\x80\x99s give businesses a reason and an incentive to come back to investing in America.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe already know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most dedicated workers; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most ambitious innovators; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great business climate here that\xe2\x80\x99s the envy of the world; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best colleges and universities; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got terrific job-training programs; we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, as I mentioned, an infrastructure that could benefit from some updating, but already does support a very dynamic economy.\xc2\xa0 So those the kinds of advantages that we want to capitalize on.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that advancing trade legislation is one important way for us to do that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made to not just Democrats, but to Republicans as well.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe in the power of that argument.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will his approach, or will his actions be any different?\xc2\xa0 Now that it\'s coming right down to it, and you\'re saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to aggressively advocate -- is that going to be something different than he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, or do you feel like this whole time he\xe2\x80\x99s been aggressively advocating?\xc2\xa0 Especially going up against that kind of pressure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we went up against that kind of pressure in the United States Senate and we succeeded in getting about a third of Democrats to support this legislation and we succeeded in getting 62 members of the Senate to vote for final passage -- as I recall.\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 More than 60, at least.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an indication that we have a persuasive argument.\xc2\xa0 And the President has traveled across the country talking about this issue.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked to reporters from across the country.\xc2\xa0 Just yesterday, he hosted five local television reporters here at the White House in which he conducted rather detailed, policy-centered interviews with them to talk about the impact that trade legislation would have in their communities.\xc2\xa0 The President had a conversation with Kai Ryssdal of Marketplace that aired last night, again, making this similar case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is also convening telephone calls and meetings with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I do think that you could make a case that the President has been aggressive about this both in public and in private, making the case to the American public, to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that will continue right up to the day of the House vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We just heard on the White House call going into the G7 that the President is at some point going to advocate for more sanctions against Russia.\xc2\xa0 And I feel like some form of this question comes up all the time, but now that we\'ve heard that -- I mean, the sanctions -- we know, we keep hearing about the effect that it\'s been having on the Russian economy, but it still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed Putin\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, he\xe2\x80\x99s not feeling enough pressure by his tanking economy to do anything different in regards to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So more sanctions -- I mean, what makes you think that that possibility is going to change anything now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, I\'ll say that I was getting ready for the briefing, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the entire call.\xc2\xa0 I got a readout of the call.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that the plan is for the President, when he goes to Europe, is to have a discussion with fellow European leaders about the need to extend the sanctions regime that\'s currently in place that I believe expires sometime at the end of this month.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there are a number of steps involved in that process, and this will be part of the conversation -- frankly, a wide-ranging discussion that the President will have with his G7 counterparts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to Ukraine, we\'ve acknowledged something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just observed, which is that the economic pressure that\'s been applied to Russia has not yet resulted in President Putin changing his strategic calculus inside of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We continue to see the Russian military violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We continue to see the movement of materiel and personnel across the Ukrainian border in support of Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have extensive concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s -- about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s failure to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Minsk agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is -- and this also happens to be true that the longer that the sanctions are in place, the more of an economic bite they take out of the Russian economy and the more pressure is applied to President Putin and the more President Putin and the country that he leads becomes isolated.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, yes, I would acknowledge that we have not yet seen the kind of change in behavior that we have long sought now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJ.C.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we talk about Putin and the positions that the U.S. is taking vis-\xc3\xa0-vis Ukraine, et cetera, might it be time to actually engage Putin, to ask in some ways for his support?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very close to Assad in Syria, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got his own issues with ISIL at the border in Chechnya, the individuals there, who would just relish in the fact that they could permeate his border and cause as much grief there as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, J.C., I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that the Secretary of State was just in Russia last month, where he had an opportunity to meet both with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 And again, I do think that goes to the rather complicated relationship that we have with Russia at this point, that we have been able to work effectively with Russia in the context of the P5+1 negotiations with Iran, for example.\xc2\xa0 We have been able to leverage their support for those negotiations in a way that has isolated Iran, compelled them to come to the negotiating table and has created a diplomatic opening that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to seize here to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And Russia has legitimately, to their credit, been a good partner in that regard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut when it comes to Ukraine, we have significant concerns about their behavior and the way that they have pretty recklessly escalated the situation in that neighboring country.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been blunt about conveying those concerns to President Putin, both in public, as I think I am now, but also in the private conversations that the President and Secretary Kerry have had with him over the last year, year and a half.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the ISIL threat, that\xe2\x80\x99s something else.\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s an interest that he has in a coordinated effort perhaps to help defeat that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And I know that President Putin has said publicly that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned about the threat of extremism in that region of the world, and we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of that.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there are some areas where we\xe2\x80\x99re able to work effectively with the Russians to advance the security interests of the United States and to advance the broader cause of stability around the globe.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, there have been situations where Russians have contributed to exactly the kind of instability that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to snuff out.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty blunt about those areas where we agree and where we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And that will not prevent us from continuing to deepen our cooperation where we can, but also continuing to raise significant objections and concerns where we need to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the trade.\xc2\xa0 If Nancy Pelosi is right and the Republicans really need to deliver 200 votes -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the 17 Democrats.\xc2\xa0 By my count, that\xe2\x80\x99s about 9 percent of the Democratic caucus has been convinced by what you have said is a very persuasive argument from the President.\xc2\xa0 I mean, less than 10 percent of Democrats are willing to listen to something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about for a long time, forcefully saying it\xe2\x80\x99s important, a top priority?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the argument.\xc2\xa0 We can evaluate this after Democrats and Republicans in the House have had an opportunity to vote on it.\xc2\xa0 And remember, our goal here is to, not alone, build a lot of Democratic support for this bill; our goal here is to build sufficient bipartisan support for this bill that it will pass the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the effort that we\'re engaged in right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you\'re trying to persuade more Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have more luck there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong case to make to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Even people who may not agree with us on a pretty wide range of issues, I do think that there is a reason to think that there are some Republicans -- a lot of Republicans -- who could get on board with this piece of legislation, too, in terms of the impact that it would have on the economy in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re not hesitating to make that case either. But our efforts have principally been focused on Democrats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think President Obama, if he were still Senator Obama, if he were still in Congress, would he be supporting this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do feel confident that if the President were in Congress that this is something that he would support.\xc2\xa0 And again, the reason is that this is the most progressive piece of trade legislation that the Congress has considered and because of the enforceable labor standards, the enforceable environmental standards, the human rights protections that are included, the intellectual property protections that are included -- and because of the challenge that\'s facing our economy right now that if you acknowledge the legitimate concerns that many Democrats on Capitol Hill have raised about the impact that previous trade agreements have had on our economy and on middle-class families, the logical conclusion is that the way that the rules are currently working are not oriented to maximize the benefits for our economy and for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is making the case that we should change them, and change them in a way that will benefit our economy and that will benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what we\'re pursuing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I ask because you see the situation differently from the Oval Office than you do from Congress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s position on trade became -- evolve as he became President and he pursued NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is very strongly for this agreement now.\xc2\xa0 Do you see it differently when you\'re looking at it as kind of a national priority versus a -- when you\'re a person in Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that -- you did raise one interesting question -- there was some coverage at one point during the primary campaign about the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise essentially to renegotiate NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that both Mexico and Canada are part of this agreement, and this agreement would actually raise the labor and environmental standards beyond what they currently are as codified in NAFTA to a higher standard.\xc2\xa0 And I actually think that\'s the President following through on a promise that he did make, I guess it was seven years ago now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I do think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of this has been pretty consistent.\xc2\xa0 I think I would concede that it\'s not particularly surprising that members of Congress who have a smaller constituency might have a different view than the President of the United States, who essentially has a national constituency.\xc2\xa0 I think that might lead some people to draw some different conclusions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I think is also true is that there is ample reason for Democrats and progressives and those who share the President\xe2\x80\x99s values when it comes to looking out for middle-class families -- for them to support this legislation for exactly the same reasons that he does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 You probably saw we had another presidential announcement yesterday in Lincoln Chafee.\xc2\xa0 One of his platforms is to go to the metric system.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) I was wondering if the White House has a position on moving the United States to the metric system.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any careful consideration of that policy, but maybe the debate that former Governor Chafee will inject into the American political system will prompt a more careful look at that kind of policy change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re not ruling it out?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling out consideration of the debate that Governor Chafee apparently believes would be critical to the success of our country moving forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Laura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 FIFA.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, one of your favorite topics these days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very important topic.\xc2\xa0 Do you think in your fight in the United States against the corruption, FIFA will be a topic during the G7?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it will come up at the G7.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that there are a lot of soccer fans who will be attending the G7 -- even at the highest levels.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how much discussion there will be.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President has confidence in the career prosecutors who have taken a careful look at this issue and are conducting the ongoing investigation. So I think even in those private conversations there\xe2\x80\x99s probably not a whole lot that the President will have to say.\xc2\xa0 But again, given the high concentration of soccer fans that will be in attendance in the meetings, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it came up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to The Washington Post yesterday, more than 1,000 migrants died in Qatar, building a stadium for the soccer games in 2022.\xc2\xa0 Did you follow that?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House have any reaction regarding the Qatar involvement and the possibility of being part of the investigation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into some of the details of the investigation because it\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, and I don\'t want to be perceived as inappropriately influencing that ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d reserve comment on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you concerned by the Qatar name coming back all the times in this investigation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation, and I have confidence that our federal prosecutors will do their due diligence in terms of trying to learn more as they carry out their investigation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A budget question.\xc2\xa0 Just this week the OMB Director sent more letters to Capitol Hill saying the spending bills are inadequate, don\'t fund enough.\xc2\xa0 But if you ask appropriators, they say sequestration is still the law, it\xe2\x80\x99s all we can do.\xc2\xa0 At what point do budget negotiations have to start to eliminate the sequester?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re in favor of those conversations starting sooner rather than later.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign a budget -- or he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to sign legislation that adheres to those sequester levels.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of across-the-board cuts in government spending have had a negative impact on our economy, and the President won\xe2\x80\x99t be supportive of legislation that extends that policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President will, however, be supportive of is a process that members of Congress engaged in a couple of years ago where Democrats and Republicans sat down at the negotiating table and were able to work in bipartisan fashion to raise those caps in a way that raised funding both for our national security priorities, but also for priorities that are critical to the success of our economy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President would be very supportive of a process like that taking place this time around, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat necessarily would have to be a process that\'s led by members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans would both have to be involved.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, if anything is going to pass through the Congress it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require bipartisan support because of the need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as the administration was last time, members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team would play an active role in trying to facilitate that kind of agreement being reached.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress would pursue a similar approach this time. I know that Speaker Boehner himself has indicated at least an openness to that kind of process this year.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see if that\xe2\x80\x99s how members of Congress decide that they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to handle their business.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see any sign of that starting, or is it going to take like a crisis here to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, hopefully, it won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that those kinds of conversations have begun.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m probably a bad source for that.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress or even some of my chatty colleagues on Capitol Hill might be able to give you a better sense of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the interviews yesterday with the local stations, as well as Marketplace.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that the President said, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s probably said this before, is that some jobs will be lost in some sectors of the economy.\xc2\xa0 So do you understand why members of Congress who represent areas that feel like they were hurt or even decimated by NAFTA are not open to the arguments?\xc2\xa0 What can he say to them to convince them that this time it will be different?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what he would say to them is that, first of all, those who were affected negatively by NAFTA can support an effort to try to rewrite the NAFTA agreement in a way that raises standards, that would put upward pressure on the labor and environmental standards that are being adopted by Mexico and Canada, but also 10 other countries in the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 That precisely what the President believes is the best and most effective way for us to advocate for the future of our economy and middle-class families.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President I think was also pretty clear about why he believed that trade adjustment assistance legislation was so important, so that if there are individuals or businesses or communities that are perceived to have a negative consequence from an agreement like this, that those workers can get the kind of skills and training that they need to benefit from the upside, from the enormous opportunity that\xe2\x80\x99s created by this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other thing that the President -- the other point that the President made that should not get lost in this debate is that globalization and technology innovation have had a much more profound impact on the changing economy and the changing workplace than these kinds of trade agreements have.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, these kinds of trade agreements are a way for us to try to alleviate the negative impact of those broader trends that in some cases have had a negative impact on local economies or on individual businesses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so if we\xe2\x80\x99re actually thinking about what we want the future of our economy and the future of our workforce to look like, withdrawing from the global economy is not an option -- at least it\xe2\x80\x99s not a constructive one -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be better off if we engage in the international economy.\xc2\xa0 And if we open up opportunities for American businesses to do business overseas, we have to recognize that 95 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s customers live outside our borders.\xc2\xa0 And if we can put American businesses in a more advantageous position to compete for those customers, then American workers are going to win.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President is committed to making sure that our workers have the skills and training that they need to get those good jobs to support those businesses, and to benefit from the economic opportunity that exists out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Take you back some months to a topic we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about in a long time, but the U.S. District Court in D.C. today released the sentencing memorandum for Omar Gonzalez, as he\xe2\x80\x99s known, the White House fence jumper.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you can tell us if the President has been kept up to date on the prosecution or any other aspect of this case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten standalone briefings on this.\xc2\xa0 But this is an issue that has obtained -- or has received a lot of news coverage, and so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the President is aware of the most recent details.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you this before, but it\xe2\x80\x99s some months -- the incident happened in September; it\xe2\x80\x99s now June.\xc2\xa0 There is no permanent fix yet -- at least visibly around the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is that okay?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is supportive of the reforms that Director Clancy has put in place over the last several months, and there are steps that have been taken -- both some security measures have been taken, some of which are visible and some of which aren\xe2\x80\x99t, as you pointed out.\xc2\xa0 But the President continues to have full confidence not just in Director Clancy, but in the professionalism of the men and women in the Secret Service who take very seriously their responsibility to put in place reforms that will bolster the security at the White House complex, but also ensure that the men and women of that agency are living up the very high standards that they\xe2\x80\x99ve established for themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you specifically about the fence because it\xe2\x80\x99s not obvious -- just a physical barrier, but it sends a psychological message, as well, to people that we\'re serious about it.\xc2\xa0 How long is too long to get that fence fixed?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a couple of things, Chris.\xc2\xa0 There is one security measure that is obvious to anybody who walks along Pennsylvania Avenue that there has been essentially a buffer established around some parts of the fence line north of the White House.\xc2\xa0 And that has proved to be helpful in deterring individuals who might be unwisely contemplating scaling the fence at the North Lawn of the White House.\xc2\xa0 So there are some security measures that have been put in place that do seem to have had an impact.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying it absolutely has been helpful?\xc2\xa0 You know that unequivocally that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think that there have been public reports about individuals who have been detained who have tried to go over that fence, but weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get over the other one.\xc2\xa0 And I know those are breeches that receive a lot of attention from all of you, and understandably so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, look, the fact is that there are a whole range of reforms, some of which involve advanced training for security officers; some of which involve security measures that are not readily visible.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to have confidence in the professionalism and effort that our men and women in the Secret Service put in to keeping the White House and the First Family safe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that NPR interview, the President said China has put out feelers about joining either the Trans-Pacific Partnership or maybe the Trans-Pacific Partnership evolving to include China.\xc2\xa0 What did he mean by that?\xc2\xa0 And how should members of Congress and the general public interpret that as consideration draws near on TPA and its successor, which is TPP?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is something that both Secretary Lew and Ambassador Froman have talked about a little bit.\xc2\xa0 China is not involved in the current TPP negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There are 12 other Asia Pacific countries, but China is not one of them.\xc2\xa0 What we have made clear --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not become one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they are not part of the current negotiations and they will not be a part of the current negotiations.\xc2\xa0 What we have made clear, though, is if we can reach a TPP agreement that other countries in the region who are interested in joining, that we would be willing to have those discussions, but those discussions would be predicated on a commitment from those countries to meeting the high standards that everybody else who has entered in the agreement lives up to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that is the critical part of this argument, which is that if China is willing to, at some point down the line, meet the very high labor standards -- frankly, compared to what are currently in place in China -- if they\'re willing to abide by the enforceable environmental standards, if they\'re willing to abide by the human rights protections that are included in the agreement, if they are willing to adopt the pretty strict intellectual property rules that will be written into this agreement and all of the other enforceable provisions of the agreement, then members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership will have conversations with China about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the fact is China is not currently part of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 It is hard to imagine China being able to make all of those changes in the short term.\xc2\xa0 But if reaching this agreement does have the effect of China reorienting their policy in this direction, that would, of course, be good for the U.S. economy and, frankly, is part of a broader reorientation that the President would like to see, which is starting to level the playing field to open up access to overseas markets for American businesses and allowing those American businesses to compete on a more level playing field with businesses in Asia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRight now that level playing field doesn\'t exist.\xc2\xa0 And over the long term if we want to ensure the vibrancy of the U.S. economy, one of the things that we need to do is to make sure that American businesses have the opportunity to compete overseas.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just so I make sure I understand -- you\'re asserting that TPA and TPP would constitute a full-blown renegotiation of NAFTA, as Senator Obama promised in the Ohio primary?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It would constitute addressing -- successfully -- so many of the concerns that Democrats have raised about the impact of NAFTA on the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President was talking about in the context of the campaign, was acknowledging that there were some communities who did not benefit from NAFTA.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they actually suffered some negative consequences as a result of that trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 And to try to address those concerns and to try to address those impact, the President believes that we should raise labor standards, raise environmental standards, and do some of the other things that are included in TPP, as well as offer additional trade adjustment assistance to make sure that those workers who may not benefit right away from the trade agreement can get the skills and training that they need to seize the opportunity that\'s created by this very agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you are probably aware, there was a rather lively exchange at the State Department yesterday over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear stockpile and its presumed eventual violation of the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 And it was the State Department spokesperson\xe2\x80\x99s point of view that this is essentially a nonissue.\xc2\xa0 As you\'re probably aware, that\'s not the way it\xe2\x80\x99s viewed by members of Congress in the Senate or the House.\xc2\xa0 Just to start this conversation, give us the explanation, if you can, why Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear stockpile and where it is now and where it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to be does not violate the Joint Plan of Action and should be of no concern to those who want to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the first thing I would say is that the IAEA, in their report -- nowhere in their report does it say that this is a violation of the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is, we have seen the kind of fluctuation in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s stockpile of low-enriched uranium even in previous agreements.\xc2\xa0 And the reason we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that fluctuation is because Iran does continue to produce low-enriched uranium consistent with the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 The requirements of the interim agreement, however, are that they abide by the cap by the end of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring is to make sure that they abide by this cap that\xe2\x80\x99s established for June 30th.\xc2\xa0 Previous iterations of the agreement they have met.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a similar fluctuation and by the end of the agreement --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On average.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not on average.\xc2\xa0 By the end date --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the end date.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They have to be at the cap.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate their continued compliance with the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe third thing I would point out is that the only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation is because we now have a lot of insight into Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and that is a direct consequence of the Joint Plan of Action, that Iran has submitted to extensive monitoring of their nuclear activities.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are able to assess, with such great precision, exactly what their stockpile looks like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is that if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach a final agreement by June 30th, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that the final agreement would dramatically reduce even further Iran\xe2\x80\x99s stockpile of low-enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 So right now, the cap is at 7,650 kilograms.\xc2\xa0 The final agreement would envision Iran reducing their stockpile to just 300 kilograms.\xc2\xa0 And that is why I think a lot of people were surprised -- pleasantly so -- when the political agreement was announced that Iran would reduce their low-enriched uranium stockpile by 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 And this is exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which raises some practical concerns.\xc2\xa0 Would it reach that level?\xc2\xa0 And does any of this past behavior suggest either unwillingness to, or a technological inability to achieve that in compliance with the agreement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the first part is getting a political agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that is actually what was reached.\xc2\xa0 That is what Iran committed to in the context of those political talks in early April.\xc2\xa0 Now, there are obviously a lot of details associated with meeting this standard and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s being --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, they can agree to anything.\xc2\xa0 And then it\'s up to the IAEA and others to, A, detect whether they have, and even if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, say, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re working on it, and yet the sanctions are lifted, and they\xe2\x80\x99re about their merry way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not get ahead of ourselves.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, we have the foremost nuclear security expert in the world taking active part in those negotiations -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the Secretary of Energy, Ernie Moniz.\xc2\xa0 So he has a lot of technical knowledge about how exactly Iran can meet the commitments that they make.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have neutral international observers at the IAEA who will also be part of the most intrusive inspections measures that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program to verify their compliance with the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd to be clear, we would expect them to meet this 7,650 kilogram level by June 30th for their low-enriched uranium, and then over a period of time, they would have to meet the 300 kilogram cap.\xc2\xa0 And the process by which they start to live up to those commitments, if an agreement is reached, and the way in which sanctions relief is offered is something that is still under negotiation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President has been very clear that the kind of sanctions relief that the Iranians would like to see is not something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to offer until we start seeing a firm and clear commitment from the Iranians that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to live up to their commitments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about U.S. sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Other sanctions could be lifted as they try to move from this 7,650 kilogram to the lower mark, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do know that our P5+1 partners have similarly strong feelings about ensuring that Iran lives up to the commitments that they make in the context of a final agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Major.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about comments made by General David Petraeus in an interview with Charlie Rose. He said --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Imagine that -- on CBS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He asked them if we were winning in Iraq and the General said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, these are fights where if you\xe2\x80\x99re not winning you\xe2\x80\x99re probably losing because time is not on your side.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with the General that we\xe2\x80\x99re probably losing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, the way that we have described the situation is that there are areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress and areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced some significant setbacks.\xc2\xa0 I think General Petraeus knows more about this than either you or I do, that this is a typical characteristic of any sort of military conflict.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that taking a leading ISIL figure off the battlefield in Syria -- as we did a couple of weeks ago -- represents important progress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that over the last several months as Iraqi security forces have prevented -- essentially reduced ISILs footprint by 25 percent, that that represents important progress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that ISIL being able to take over the entire city of Ramadi represents a setback and one that we are working with the Iraqis to try to address.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think that is typical of the kind of military conflict in which the United States and our 62 coalition partners are currently engaged.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about criticism from Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi responding to some of the comments made by the General.\xc2\xa0 She said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there several times and I can remember him and others saying that they trained 175,000 Iraqis to be able to just pick up the fight themselves.\xc2\xa0 You should ask the General about that.\xc2\xa0 Perhaps they didn\xe2\x80\x99t train as many as they suggested.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair criticism?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those specific comments.\xc2\xa0 Obviously part of the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re currently pursuing inside of Iraq, again, alongside our coalition partners, is to bolster the capability and capacity of the Iraqi security forces so that they can take the fight on the ground against ISIL in Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that is a core component of our strategy and one that we are aggressively pursuing.\xc2\xa0 It is a strategy that has borne some fruit, that there are some areas inside of Iraq where coalition-trained Iraqi security forces have succeeded in taking back important strategic objectives from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But there are obviously more fighters that we would like to train, some of whom are part of the Iraqi security forces, some of them are local tribal fighters.\xc2\xa0 We would expect all of them to operate under the command-and-control of the Iraqi central government.\xc2\xa0 And when backed by coalition military airpower, we are optimistic about the kind of success they can have against ISIL fighters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The New York Times in an editorial suggested that transgender soldiers, servicemembers, should be able to serve openly.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You do not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not right now, Chris.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGo ahead, Kevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more -- as it relates to -- medical marijuana is an issue; in particular out West, that is a very hot-button issue.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that medicinal marijuana is a good idea?\xc2\xa0 Legalization -- is that a good idea as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken about this publicly quite a few times and he does not support the legalization of marijuana.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDavid.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, The New York Times (inaudible) the new Snowden documents out that claim you guys expanded the warrantless surveillance program to cover possible hacking, malicious computer hacking.\xc2\xa0 Did you guys do that?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to this story?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 David, I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously not in a position to talk in a lot of detail about any sort of covert government programs that may or may not exist.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the Director of National Intelligence has been clear that the United States is facing a cyber threat that\xe2\x80\x99s increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication, and severity of impact.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of tools that our national security and law enforcement professionals rely on to keep us safe.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of those tools is Section 702 of FISA.\xc2\xa0 And Section 702 does provide authority to target non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States in order to acquire foreign intelligence information under court oversight.<br/>\n\tAnd so that is a tool that our national security professionals have found to be valuable in protecting the country from a variety of threats, particularly cyber threats.\xc2\xa0 And this administration remains committed to being vigilant about the ever-evolving threat that we face in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 And the President spends a lot of time talking to his national security team about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying if there is warrantless surveillance of computer activity, foreign computer activity, that that\xe2\x80\x99s covered?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s legal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you specifically here is Section 702 of the FISA law.\xc2\xa0 And Section 702 provides authority to target non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and it does require court oversight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about some of the most valuable tools that we have in protecting the country from a variety of threats, including cyber threats, 702 is one of them.\xc2\xa0 And 702 is an authority that is targeted against non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be located outside the United States, and done under the supervision of a judge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnita.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we asked you about this yesterday, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was an on-the-record response from the White House and I wanted to ask you about a Senate hearing yesterday regarding inspectors general where -- there are a couple of facts.\xc2\xa0 At the end of June, seven inspector general positions in the administration have been vacant -- or will have been vacant for a year, and also that it takes 613 days to fill a vacancy in this administration.\xc2\xa0 And I know there had been some stories prior about when Secretary Clinton was at the State Department there was actually no top inspector general the entire time she was there.\xc2\xa0 So I just wondered if you could respond to the hearing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of the news accounts of the hearing.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll see if we can get you some more details on this.\xc2\xa0 I know that as it relates to the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office at the State Department, even while there was not a person in the top job there, the office was rather prolific in issuing reports holding accountable officials at the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we asked you all -- not me, but one of my colleagues yesterday and didn\xe2\x80\x99t get anything.\xc2\xa0 So if you could respond, follow up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see if we can collect some more information for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple of questions on Iran.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Leader said today that it\'s impossible to trust the U.S. and other \xe2\x80\x9carrogant powers,\xe2\x80\x9d in his words.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also said that they won\'t allow inspections of military sites, and that sanctions must be lifted all at once.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House interpret his latest comments?\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to halt negotiations?\xc2\xa0 And has the President had any communication, correspondence with the Supreme Leader since the framework agreement was reached in April?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just to take your last question first, we have acknowledged previous correspondence between the President and the Supreme Leader, but we don\'t do that regularly.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have anything new to share on that front.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn your second question, I think it is a fair assessment that the negotiations would not have proceeded as far as they have without at least the willingness on the part of the Supreme Leader to keep an open mind about the possibility of resolving this dispute diplomatically.\xc2\xa0 And so what we will continue to evaluate are the discussions at the negotiating table and the actions that Iran takes when it comes to complying with the Joint Action Plan.\xc2\xa0 And these are actions that we can verify through the IAEA.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, if the Supreme Leader were somehow of the mind that complying or cooperating with the P5+1 in the context of these negotiations or of the agreements that have already been reached that the Iranian bureaucracy would not.\xc2\xa0 Instead what we have seen is we have seen that Iran has lived up to the commitments that they made in the Joint Plan of Action, and we have seen a willingness on the part of Iranian negotiators to engage in serious talks about resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program and eventually preventing them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to his demands about sanctions relief and the inspections of military facilities, we\'ve been very clear that the political agreement that was reached the first week in April was an agreement in which Iran did commit to cooperating with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 I would acknowledge that there are additional details about those inspections that need to be worked out.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very clear -- and this is true both in public and in private, I would point out -- that the United States is not prepared to offer sanctions relief until we see a genuine commitment from the Iranians to living up to the terms of whatever agreement is ultimately reached, if one can be reached by the end of June.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s been our position, and it\'s not going to change.\xc2\xa0 And it is a change -- or it is a position that is central to the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf the Iranians adopt a position that says they will not be part of any agreement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t start with sanctions relief, then that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the United States will not sign on to. The President has made that very clear, that we need to see sustained commitment from the Iranians to living up to the terms of the agreement before sanctions relief is offered.\xc2\xa0 And we will also need to see verification by the international community that Iran is continuing to do that.\xc2\xa0 And all of that will be written into the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe thing that I will say is that there is great interest on the part of Iran in escaping the economic sanctions that have been put in place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s put significant pressure on their domestic economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what has compelled them to the negotiating table, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we are hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to reach an agreement that would, through diplomacy, prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 One of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s negotiators said today that they won\xe2\x80\x99t allow inspections of military sites but they would agree to permit what they\xe2\x80\x99re calling \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled access\xe2\x80\x9d of nuclear facilities.\xc2\xa0 Is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled access\xe2\x80\x9d something the President is open to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these are things -- these are details -- and you\xe2\x80\x99re raising legitimate questions.\xc2\xa0 These are exactly the kinds of details that are being discussed around the negotiating table by the Iranians and the United States and our P5+1 partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to discuss our negotiating position from here other than to say that an agreement will not go forward unless Iran commits to cooperating with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tToluse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one question on trade and then a couple on the OPEC meeting happening tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 On trade, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about how successful or how valuable the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy has been, you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned the Senate 62-37 vote, and it seems like that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really translated over to the House because that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happening in a vacuum.\xc2\xa0 The House members were hearing those same arguments, but it seems like it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really convinced a lot of them.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering how --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I would just say it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to reach that conclusion because the House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t voted yet.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll make our case right up until the minute that the House decides to start casting votes.\xc2\xa0 And like I told Jon, at that point we can have a discussion evaluating the strategy that the White House has put forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out that our goal here is predicated on building a bipartisan majority to pass this trade legislation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that with as many Democrats as we can get. But the definition of enough Democrats is enough to build the bipartisan majority that we seek for this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like there\xe2\x80\x99s no plan to change the strategy at all or to increase what you\'ve done in the Senate given the fact that a number of House Democrats have, as Jon said, maybe 80, 90 percent have said that they\'re not in favor of this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to evaluate those tallies at the end.\xc2\xa0 But the President has made a very aggressive case both in public and in private.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken to a number of reporters.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s traveled across the country.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s hosted private meetings and had private conversations with individual members of Congress, with small groups of members of Congress, even what could be described as rather large groups of members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So the President has put forward a pretty aggressive case.\xc2\xa0 It yielded a favorable outcome in the United States Senate, and we\'re optimistic that it will yield a bipartisan majority in the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on OPEC, the OPEC group is going to meet tomorrow in Vienna.\xc2\xa0 The meeting comes just a couple of weeks before the Iran deadline.\xc2\xa0 Iran is already sort of saying that they can be prepared for about a million additional barrels of oil if the sanctions are removed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that issue is coming into the negotiations, whether or not the issue of oil is something that you all are -- whether or not it has become a sticking point in the negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can\'t give you a whole lot of new insight into the details of the ongoing negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I do think that that public position, public policy position that Iran has taken, is indicative of something that I was trying to convey to Colleen, which is that the Iranian leadership is feeling the economic pressure of the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And having the ability to sell more of their oil on the international market to raise additional revenue is something that they are keenly interested in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that pressure has compelled them to come to the negotiating table and to participate in those talks in a serious way.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful that it will ultimately lead to a diplomatic resolution or a diplomatic agreement that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 The Census Bureau said yesterday that the U.S. exported almost 600,000 barrels of crude in April.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a record.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that increase bears any weight on the decision of whether to change the U.S. position on the crude export ban, and whether or not you have an update on where that stands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the Department of Commerce, though, that may be able to give you a sense of whether any kind of change is in the works.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPatty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several prominent Sunni tribes in Anbar pledged allegiance to ISIL today.\xc2\xa0 First, what is your reaction to that? How big of a setback is that?\xc2\xa0 And is the U.S. government doing anything actively to try and get them to switch allegiance back to the Iraqi government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Patty, what we have indicated is that it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important for the central government in Iraq to govern that country in a multi-sectarian, inclusive fashion.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Abadi has a difficult task.\xc2\xa0 He needs to unite his diverse country to confront the threat from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And there is nothing more that ISIL would like to do than to try to cause that country to start to fracture along sectarian lines.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we have been pleased that Prime Minister Abadi has gone to great lengths to try to keep that diverse country together.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true as he\xe2\x80\x99s governed the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been true as he\xe2\x80\x99s led the Iraqi security forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out one thing that I have observed and discussed here is that there is strong support among the Anbar Provincial Council-- made up almost entirely of Sunnis, I would assume -- for the military strategy that Prime Minister Abadi has put in place to try to drive ISIL out of Anbar.\xc2\xa0 We are having some success in recruiting local tribal fighters to be trained and equipped, and to fight for their communities and their families under the command and control of the Iraqi central government and Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 Those are all positive signs, and they reflect the commitment on the part of Prime Minister Abadi to building and mobilizing a multi-sectarian response to the ISIL threat in his country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut obviously we\'re aware and he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of the effort that ISIL is undertaking to try to recruit Iraqi Sunnis to their side. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also why Prime Minister Abadi has rather conspicuously tried to demonstrate a commitment to a multi-sectarian government and a multi-sectarian security force to protect the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These tribes are saying they just don\'t believe him and that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done enough.\xc2\xa0 So is there more he could do to try and regain their loyalty?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate that he is doing a lot to demonstrate his commitment to this multi-sectarian principle.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and our coalition partners are entirely supportive of his efforts to do exactly that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tShirish.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you expressed confidence -- the administration has confidence that you\xe2\x80\x99ll win in King v. Burwell.\xc2\xa0 In the event that doesn\'t happen, does the White House, does the President, does Congress have an obligation to try to help these states -- many of them with Republican leadership in the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office, in legislatures -- who have actively chosen not to have an exchange?\xc2\xa0 What is the job of Congress and the President were that to happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Shirish, we have a lot of confidence in the strength of the legal arguments that Solicitor General Don Verilli presented to the Supreme Court in the context of the Halbig/King case.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnfortunately, over the last five or six years, we have not seen much willingness on the part of Republicans in Congress to act constructively when it comes to health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Instead what we have seen is that Republicans have voted more than four dozen times to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the other fact is that an adverse ruling in the Supreme Court would have the effect of throwing the health insurance market all across the country into chaos.\xc2\xa0 And there is no indication that Republicans in Congress are willing to do anything constructive to address that.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty forthright about the fact that there is no straightforward, easy, administrative solution to address this problem promptly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s why we take a lot of solace in knowing that there is a lot of power behind the legal argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a legal argument that many lower courts have found persuasive.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re hopeful, maybe even optimistic, that the Supreme Court will, as well.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately it will be up to the nine justices to reach that conclusion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they don\'t, is there anything that the -- I mean, I understand ultimately the states have to choose to want to buy into this, have to choose to either set up an exchange or something.\xc2\xa0 Can the administration make it very, very easy for them to do that, by making it incredibly simple to set up an exchange the way Oregon and I guess Maryland did after theirs didn\'t work?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously this is a policy question you\'re asking that\'s extraordinarily complicated.\xc2\xa0 And in some situations the complicated nature of this policy has been on full public display.\xc2\xa0 So for the technical question you\'re asking, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to HHS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a general matter, what our professionals have said -- those who are steeped in the details of the health law and who are aware of the legal arguments that underpin this policy -- that there is no simple, straightforward administrative fix that would solve a problem resulting from an adverse Supreme Court decision that would have a prompt impact in trying to correct that damage.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, that\'s why we take solace in the knowledge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a persuasive, powerful legal argument to make; one that has convinced -- or persuaded many federal judges at lower levels of the wisdom of our position.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a case that was fortunately made at the Supreme Court by the Solicitor General.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, ultimately it will be up to the nine justices of the Supreme Court to decide.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCharlie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Texas Governor Rick Perry just announced a run for the President.\xc2\xa0 And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo decision has done more harm than the President\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a response to that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Charlie, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve refrained from sort of getting to a back and forth with presidential candidates, particularly on their announcement day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Based on my own experience, that candidates understandably believe that the best way for them to win attention in a crowded primary field is to find a colorful way to criticize and in some cases even insult the incumbent President in the other party.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s them doing their job.\xc2\xa0 But today I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do mine and not respond.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.
