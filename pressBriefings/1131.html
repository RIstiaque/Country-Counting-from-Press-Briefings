EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to begin, if I may, with a readout of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s video teleconference with President Karzai of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0President Obama spoke with President Karzai this morning via video teleconference.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders spoke for approximately one hour and discussed a number of topics, including the impact of the death of Osama bin Laden on the fight against terrorism and on regional dynamics, their shared commitment to Afghan-led reconciliation, progress on forging an enduring U.S.-Afghan strategic partnership, and transition to Afghan leadership for security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President expressed his sorrow over tragic civilian casualties, most recently in Helmand province.\xc2\xa0 Both leaders noted that the Taliban are responsible for the great majority of civilian losses, and agreed that every loss of civilian life is a tragedy and undermines our mission that focuses on protecting the population.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The two leaders agreed to maintain their close consultations going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Julie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on that readout.\xc2\xa0 Did the President share with Karzai any of the discussions he\xe2\x80\x99s been having here about the drawdown that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place in July?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- the two Presidents, rather, discussed the process of transition to an Afghan lead, which is related very much directly to the question that you asked.\xc2\xa0 They agreed to continue those consultations, and President Obama will certainly be in close touch with President Karzai as we finalize the pace and scope of the reduction in U.S. troops that will begin in July.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t giving him any heads up on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There was not a discussion of specific numbers.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and it remains the case, the President has not made a decision yet about the pace and scope.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously going to be having discussions with his team in the coming days and weeks about that matter and will make his decision soon, as he said the other day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just ask you a couple questions on Libya.\xc2\xa0 In the past day or so, there seems to have been a drop in momentum for the Kerry-McCain resolution in the Senate, and now we have this new proposal from Corker and Webb that appears to be similar to the House resolution from last week.\xc2\xa0 Given all of that, can the administration really still say at this point that you are providing all of the answers that Congress is looking for on the Libya campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can say that this President takes very seriously what he sees as his obligation and his administration\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to consult regularly with Congress, broadly and with the appropriate members of the appropriate committees, on matters like his policy towards Libya.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that those consultations on Libya have been extensive and constant.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I went over the list of engagements that this administration has had with members of Congress on Libya, just Libya, since shortly before this operation began, and it numbers 40 -- 40 engagements of different types of briefings and consultations.\xc2\xa0 We will continue those consultations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And with regards to the resolution that the Speaker of the House authored, we will answer the questions in that resolution in the spirit that we have answered questions that members have had in the past, and consistent with that approach towards consulting Congress, we will answer the questions in that resolution within the time frame that he specifies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you do it in the way that the House has asked for, in a written, detailed report?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a format for you, but we will certainly endeavor to answer the questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the Corker and Webb proposal, would you also characterize that as being unhelpful and unnecessary?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if it\xe2\x80\x99s similar or precisely the same, then it would be -- our reaction to it would be the same.\xc2\xa0 We have said from the beginning that we would support and appreciate expressions of support by Congress for the mission.\xc2\xa0 I think the goals that the President shares -- the goals that the President has, rather, with regard to Libya are widely shared by members of Congress of both parties and both houses, and that is to allow the Libyan people to choose their own future, and with regard to the NATO mission, to protect civilians, enforce a no-fly zone, and enforce an arms embargo.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I just switch topics quickly?\xc2\xa0 Tim Kaine has called for Anthony Weiner to resign.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no comment on that story.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes -- hey, welcome.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask what the White House reaction was to the OPEC meeting today, which broke up without a decision to raise production.\xc2\xa0 Had the U.S. been putting pressure on any member for an increase, and does that make it more likely that the U.S. will tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take those questions in order.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is very concerned about high energy prices, in particular the impact that energy prices have on prices at the gas pump because Americans are struggling to make ends meet and when prices go up at the pump it affects everything they do because of their reliance on cars for transportation to and from work and other places.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So as you -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him talk about this a lot and this is an issue that is very much on his mind, and he has taken a number of steps with regard to that, including directing the Attorney General to create a task force to look at potential cases of fraud and manipulation of the markets that could have a negative impact on consumers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He is looking at a lot of options -- sorry, backing up to your middle question -- this administration has been in regular contact with the IEA as well as oil-producing countries during this time of elevated energy prices.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we are in a situation where supply is not meeting demand, and there are a variety of reasons for that, including disruption caused by the situation in Libya, which has removed 1.5 million barrels a day from the market.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve had those conversations within that context.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the President considers that an option, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision about that, but as you know it is designed -- the reserve is designed to deal with disruptions in oil supplies.\xc2\xa0 And the President considers that an option going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one other question on Syria?\xc2\xa0 Looking for the White House reaction to the situation that is -- thousands of people have fled a town near Turkey, fearing a military assault.\xc2\xa0 I wondered how the White House saw that situation maybe compared to the early days in Libya, and what needs to be done about Syria at the U.N. Security Council or otherwise?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, each country of course is different.\xc2\xa0 So I would hesitate before making direct comparisons between Libya and any other country that is experiencing unrest.\xc2\xa0 We strongly condemn, and have condemned, the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s murder and mass arrests of its own people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have imposed additional sanctions on the regime, including on President Assad and his inner circle.\xc2\xa0 We stand by the Syrian people, who have shown tremendous courage in demanding dignity and a transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0President Assad now has a choice.\xc2\xa0 He can lead the transition or he can get out of the way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions for you.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this study by McKinsey &amp; Company noting that the health care requirements that take effect in 2014 will \xe2\x80\x9cincrease medical costs for many companies.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And in their survey of 1,300 employers, they note that a significant percentage will definitely or probably drop coverage or pursue alternatives to employer-based insurance.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the White House response is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We saw that report.\xc2\xa0 And I can simply say that that report is pretty starkly at odds with the experts from the Congressional Budget Office, the RAND Corporation, the Urban Institute.\xc2\xa0 And it is also starkly at odds with history.\xc2\xa0 History has shown that reform motivates more businesses to offer insurance.\xc2\xa0 Health insurance in Massachusetts, for example, uses a similar structure as the Affordable Care Act, with an exchange, a personal responsibility requirement, and an employer responsibility requirement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And a number of individuals with employer-sponsored insurance in Massachusetts has increased.\xc2\xa0 We are confident the Affordable Care Act will strengthen our existing system, employer-based system, going forward.\xc2\xa0 So we simply just disagree with those conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What state was that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Bay State, home of my beloved Boston Red Sox.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Romney says it\xe2\x80\x99s totally different.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you mind if I --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me continue with Jake.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Do you take issue with the report\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the requirements of the law will increase medical costs for many companies?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you take issue with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Affordable Care Act will reduce costs overall.\xc2\xa0 It is one of the reasons why the President pursued insurance reform, because he wanted to address the burden that costs were placing on individuals as well as businesses.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we disagree with the conclusions of the report.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then in light of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President of Gabon, is it appropriate for President Obama to honor Ali Bongo with a White House visit, given the fact that the State Department recently reported that the country is home to widespread government corruption, and in light of an ongoing criminal investigation in France about the source of money to buy President Bongo\xe2\x80\x99s homes in France?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, as you know, Gabon is holding the rotating presidency of the U.N. Security Council; it\xe2\x80\x99s an important position.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, Gabon has voted in ways that we consider very helpful on issues like C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, Libya, and Iran.\xc2\xa0 It has been an important ally in our efforts in those countries through the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we do think it is appropriate for the President to meet with the leader of Gabon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And we are obviously, as we are in a number of countries, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about human rights issues.\xc2\xa0 And President Bongo has made a number of reforms in his country, and that country of Gabon is increasingly playing a more important role as a regional and global leader on such issues as the ones I mentioned -- Libya, C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, and Iran.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously -- we think it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a worthwhile meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There a lot of people in that country who look at President Bongo as seriously corrupt, and he is going to be able to use this visit at the White House, with President Obama, as a way of building up his popular support.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the President of the United States is meeting with the President, as he does with other heads of state, who have less than sterling perhaps records because of the -- first of all, the President of Gabon is making reform efforts, which we support.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, as I said, Gabon has been an important partner in some of the issues that are very important to the American nation security, U.S. security interests regarding C\xc3\xb4te d\xe2\x80\x99Ivoire, Libya, and Iran and other issues.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for the President to have this meeting for that reason.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to this report from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats basically talking about inefficiency in the way aid is being spent in Afghanistan, and also saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s really a threat of a severe economic depression once U.S. troops are out?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we welcome the report even though we do not endorse all of the conclusions of it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that Afghanistan has made significant progress, and the presumption that our assistance has contributed little and that Afghanistan has made no progress is just simply wrong and we disagree with that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As President Obama noted earlier this week, we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s momentum.\xc2\xa0 We are training Afghan forces, and -- with the goal of turning over security lead to the Afghan forces between the drawdown that begins in July 2011 and 2014.\xc2\xa0 Civilian assistance is important but it represents a small proportion of the overall cost of our mission in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But it is an essential component of our critical national security strategy in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And remember, if the goal here is to transition more and more responsibility to the Afghans and the Afghan security forces, it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the civilian assistance part of this be effective so that it builds capacity that allows us to do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And on sustainability, we agree that that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why so many of our efforts are focused on building institutions so that Afghans can sustain the progress that has been made over these last several years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is that -- the President is concerned that there could be major economic repercussions?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying once --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is very clear-eyed about the country, about its -- the challenges it face -- it faces.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the assistance we provide is aimed at improving the chances that Afghanistan can sustain itself as we begin to draw down our forces and transition the lead to Afghan security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is, if the White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see eye to eye with all of the findings of the report, then which findings is there disagreement on -- the inefficiency finding or sort of a threat economically?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- while we obviously agree with aspects of it, some of the challenges that Afghanistan faces, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that its assessment of the overall progress is the same as ours or that its potential for sustainability is the same as ours.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are any of these things factoring in --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we welcome the report and we read it with interest.\xc2\xa0 And we are constantly adjusting our -- at a tactical level, how we engage in Afghanistan in the civilian -- in our civilian assistance programs, obviously as well as with our military programs, to maximize our success.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what do these points mean as the President considers a drawdown of troops?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything -- while we welcome the report, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not news to anyone in this room, anybody in Washington, and certainly not to the President that Afghanistan faces a lot of challenges as a nation -- economically, politically.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re very aware of that.\xc2\xa0 That was something the President focused a great deal on from the beginning of his presidency as he began to review our policy in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Mr. Knoller.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the Karzai conference call, did the President say or tell President Karzai that the United States will continue to engage in Predator strikes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go into any greater detail about the nature of their conversation.\xc2\xa0 It was a good one for an hour that covered a lot of topics.\xc2\xa0 And as I think I mentioned, the President spoke with and expressed his concern, shared concern, to President Karzai about civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 But as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past and certainly others from the Pentagon and elsewhere have said, our mission in the region is to -- our number one goal is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And we are prosecuting that mission.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you able to say if President Karzai asked the President not to stop all the Predator strikes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not able to characterize the conversation further.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Libya, Senator Lugar in an op-ed piece a couple of days ago said consultations with Congress are not enough.\xc2\xa0 He said the President needs to ask Congress to specifically authorize U.S. military engagement in Libya.\xc2\xa0 What does the President say to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President says, through me and would have said yesterday if he were asked this question, that we -- he believes that he is acting -- that his actions are -- have been consistent with the War Powers resolution and, furthermore, that the consultations are very important.\xc2\xa0 And we have been in extensive consultations with Congress about our mission in Libya -- the goals of which we believe are widely shared by Republicans and Democrats and House members and senators.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he will not seek specific congressional authorization?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we support and would welcome expressions of support from Congress, similar to the resolution put forward by Senators McCain and Kerry and other Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more to say on that beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two more polls today by FOX and Gallup show widespread disapproval of the President\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the economy by an almost two-to-one margin.\xc2\xa0 One yesterday by Washington Post and ABC indicated most people don\xe2\x80\x99t even believe the economic recovery has begun.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I explain it by saying that we are still struggling to emerge out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, a jobs hole of 8 million, tremendous loss of jobs.\xc2\xa0 We have over the past 15 months created more than 2.1 [million] private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an enormous amount, but it is not nearly enough.\xc2\xa0 And the President is aware of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And obviously if you\xe2\x80\x99re an American who is still struggling with the reality that was true for the decade prior to this President getting here -- certainly eight years prior -- where middle-class incomes had stagnated and in some ways reversed, even as upper incomes expanded dramatically.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve been experiencing that squeeze for a long time and maybe you have a job, fortunately, but you\xe2\x80\x99re being hit by higher energy prices, you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about your mortgage, you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about sending your child or children to college.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like the economy is strong enough.\xc2\xa0 You may not feel all that great about the economy even if you do have a job, which obviously is the most important thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So we understand and the President understands and focuses on this precisely because he will not rest and will not be satisfied until every American who\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a job can get one.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the number one priority of his presidency and he continues to be focused on it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he was -- held the event that he had today at Northern Virginia Community College, which was all about making sure that the training and education that Americans are getting can match up with the kinds of jobs that manufacturers in the United States are looking to fill.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s his number one priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Barrasso said today that government regulations and debt are like putting on the emergency brake to the economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you disagree?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly think that, as the President does, that we need to get our fiscal house in order, we need to reduce our deficits and our debt, and we need to do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 We certainly think that the $10 trillion debt that he inherited is a drag on the economy as a significant portion of the debt that we have now -- a debt incurred in part by two substantial tax cuts that went disproportionately to wealthy Americans that were unpaid for, two wars that were put on a credit card.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 This President is very concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 You have to remember, however, that when he came to office, we were in an economic freefall and we had to take dramatic action in order to prevent the Great Recession from becoming the second Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We did that, and we have experienced positive economic growth for the last seven quarters.\xc2\xa0 We have experienced significant private sector job growth for the past 15 months.\xc2\xa0 We are headed in the right direction and we need to continue to do things like invest in those areas of the economy that have the greatest potential for growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 We need to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do it in a balanced way, including, for example, deciding that -- going back to the question about gas prices -- that the $4 trillion -- or rather, billion dollars that we spend subsidizing the oil industry could be better spent elsewhere, like investing in clean energy technology.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did Austan Goolsbee leave because of policy differences?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 Austan Goolsbee left because he needed to return to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 He has a young family.\xc2\xa0 He has a tenure job at the university there.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s a very close advisor to the President, a friend of the President, and he will continue to advise the President from the outside and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will assist with the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final question.\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod, Robert Gibbs, Anita Dunn, all here today.\xc2\xa0 Are you focusing on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Auburn football team is here as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, that explains Robert.\xc2\xa0 Does that explain Anita Dunn and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Anita lives in Washington.\xc2\xa0 I think the only -- and her husband works here.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know in particular, beyond Robert\xe2\x80\x99s presence here to celebrate the national championship of his beloved football team.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically what those meetings might be.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there is ample reason --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That means you were not involved in those meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was not involved in -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there are any meetings.\xc2\xa0 I mean, for all I know, Axe is here having lunch with somebody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President says there -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be a double-dip recession.\xc2\xa0 The chairman of the Federal Reserve yesterday discouraged the notion or at least it was interpreted as discouraged the notion of a QE3 or any other further monetary easing, as if there was room to do that.\xc2\xa0 There is a perception today that there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a stand-pat attitude on the economy coming from Washington.\xc2\xa0 You would dispute that perception?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s free trade agreements or making permanent the R&amp;D tax credit, which the President supports, and then taking the serious approach that the President has taken towards deficit reduction in these very important meetings and negotiations being led by the Vice President, which resume again tomorrow -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of activity here driven by the desire to continue to grow the economy and continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President is focused on this as his highest priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 OPEC, their -- again, going back to OPEC -- their inability to come to an agreement on raising output.\xc2\xa0 The President cites among the headwinds of the economy high gas prices.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big of a concern is their lack of agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I answered this question.\xc2\xa0 We are in regular consultation with the IEA as well as with oil-producing states.\xc2\xa0 We believe that supply is not aligned appropriately with demand because of a number of factors, but including obviously unrest in the Middle East and specifically the disruption caused by the removal of 1.5 million barrels a day from the market because of Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So -- and then, having said that, the President has also made very clear that we and all of us in this room through our lives have been through this cycle before where gas prices spike, politicians express great alarm and demand that action be taken, gas prices go back down and nothing happens because this is a long-term problem that requires a long-term solution.\xc2\xa0 And that is the approach the President has taken, which is why he has taken measures to increase domestic oil production, why he has passed the significant car rule, which will ensure that more fuel-efficient cars are rolling off the assembly line and populating the highways and streets of our country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why he has sought to diversify our energy supply from a -- from a broad array of sources so that we do not depend on the importation of foreign oil to the extent that we do now, because it makes us highly reactive in the face of spikes in a global energy market that we can\xe2\x80\x99t control.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a final question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, former Governor Pawlenty unveiled his economic plan -- 5 percent growth he wants annually.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everybody would be happy with that.\xc2\xa0 But he also wants to raise the Social Security retirement age.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on raising the Social Security --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President said in his State of the Union address -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more than that -- that obviously we need to look at ways to strengthen Social Security.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifics for you.\xc2\xa0 The -- without slashing benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does he --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And with regards to 5 percent growth, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more; that would be very beneficial to the economy.\xc2\xa0 We think providing expansive tax cuts to the wealthy -- which we did in the last term and added tremendously to our debt and resulted in this President inheriting a massive deficit and debt in 2009 -- probably not the best approach.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is the President any closer to naming a director?\xc2\xa0 And can you comment on the Bloomberg reports of the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Bloomberg reports?\xc2\xa0 This was of a named candidate.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on any media speculation about who or who may not be under consideration.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking at a broad array of potential candidates.\xc2\xa0 He does hope to fill that post relatively soon.\xc2\xa0 And --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeframe?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- just relatively<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0soon.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more on that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other thing is -- so the third rating agency weighed in on U.S. debt, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what that -- how you -- what your response is to that and how that impacts the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it adds, as it did with the one prior, I think it makes clear the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making, that there is no alternative here to raising the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 This is not about additional spending.\xc2\xa0 This is about honoring the obligations that the United States government has made.\xc2\xa0 And the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling, as some of these rating agencies have suggested, would be severe.\xc2\xa0 And the validators for that opinion are numerous and come from a variety of political and non-political backgrounds.\xc2\xa0 It is simply incontestable that we need to do this, and we think that Congress will do it because they recognize the urgency and significance of this vote.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling about that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there have been some calls for him to get a little bit more involved.\xc2\xa0 Do things like this make him feel like perhaps it is time for him to get closer to the negotiating table, to get a little --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President appointed his Vice President, who, by the way, has some experience with these kinds of things, to oversee negotiations as the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to call people to the table -- participants in those negotiations, appointed by the leaders of Congress, including the Speaker of the House, Senate Minority Leader, Senate Majority Leader, House Minority Leader -- have been making progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So do we think that -- do we share the desire that those talks produce in a relatively short period of time a positive result?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President put the Vice President in charge of them.\xc2\xa0 And he engages on this issue daily.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will engage in it in terms of conversations with leaders and members as time progresses.\xc2\xa0 But it is a demonstration of the seriousness with which he takes this issue that he asks the Vice President to lead these negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then just quickly on Afghanistan, the other day he said he had not received a recommendation from commanders.\xc2\xa0 Has that changed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to discussing with General Petraeus, with Secretary Gates, with his entire national security team his thinking about the variety of options that he will consider in terms of the pace and slope of the drawdown.\xc2\xa0 But there is no formal recommendation or recommendations at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will he do that?\xc2\xa0 Is he planning some formal meeting --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll quote him in saying that he plans to make that decision soon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but in terms of meeting with them, do you have anything on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that you can -- I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, first of all, to step back and remember that as part of the process that he put in place with his strategy announced in December of 2009, he has been engaged in this issue at great depth with regular monthly meetings that he chairs on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the AfPak policy, with weekly meetings with Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates where Afghanistan is a frequent topic of conversation and discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As you know, the national security staff did a comprehensive review in December of our policy.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we consult with ISAF allies on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So this is a process that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to begin tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 It began a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process, because --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, does he plan to bring all of them to the table in the next week or so --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a format for you, but he will be consulting with Secretary Gates, with General Petraeus, with the rest of his national security team -- Secretary Clinton, Vice President Biden, and others -- about this decision and review the options that he has, and make a decision relatively soon as he said the other day -- yesterday, I think.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the economy Jay, what led him to warn against panic and overreacting?\xc2\xa0 To what extent is he concerned that that\xe2\x80\x99s happening --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the way I would answer that is to make a point that Austan Goolsbee made the other day, which is that when we had very strong jobs reports for three straight months, in at least two of those cases much higher than expectations, we did not pop the champagne corks or celebrate here.\xc2\xa0 And we also think while the jobs report that came most recently was under expectations and disappointing, it is important to look at the long-term trend.\xc2\xa0 And the long-term trend remains positive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the outside forecasters for economic growth in this -- the remainder of this year remain positive.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of reason to believe, and ample evidence to suggest, that this economy is growing, will continue to grow, and will continue to create jobs -- never fast enough and not enough job creation, as far as this President is concerned, until every American who\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a job can get one.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point he was making is that we need to look at the long-term trends here and not just one day or one week\xe2\x80\x99s series of economic data.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he sense panic, over-reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I think his point was just the opposite, that we have faced some headwinds.\xc2\xa0 Some of them, hopefully, were temporary, like the impact of the tsunami and earthquake in Japan and the impact that had on supply chains.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the fact is that we have continued to grow, we believe we will continue to grow, and we will continue to create jobs, private sector jobs, which is the -- the private sector is the engine of job creation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s positive.\xc2\xa0 And we need to remember that even as we acknowledge that much more work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the unemployment rate expected to be above 8.5 percent for several months, what other tools is the President considering to boost the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there are a variety of things that we need to remember about what\xe2\x80\x99s already happening in terms of the payroll tax cut, the extension of the middle-class tax cut.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s putting money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets and is helpful in terms of promoting economic growth.\xc2\xa0 There are measures like the President talked about today, in terms of matching -- these private-public ventures that match vocational and educational goals with employers who are looking for specific types of employees to hire them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a positive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And then we need to -- the President talked a lot about the need to extend the R&amp;D tax credit, because this is an area of significant potential economic growth and job creation; free trade agreements, the three free trade agreements that could create or support 70,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important that we continue to work on those and get those done.\xc2\xa0 And the President is focused on this constantly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And the fact is the policies that he has pursued and is pursuing have reversed the catastrophic economic decline we were in when we came in in 2009, and led to seven straight quarters of growth and 15 months of private sector job creation.\xc2\xa0 And we need to keep our nose to the grindstone and keep working hard to continue that growth and continue that job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, because there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a lot of improvement in the past couple months, is there something new on the table?\xc2\xa0 Is there another stimulus that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, first of all, some of those things that I mentioned are new.\xc2\xa0 They have not been acted on and need to be acted on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Secondly, we believe, done properly, an agreement to substantially reduce our deficit in a balanced way that will not harm economic growth will be a net positive for economic growth.\xc2\xa0 It could in fact be a big boost for economic growth and job creation, because of the confidence it can create.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President is so focused on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He is not approaching deficit reduction and long-term debt reduction as an esoteric exercise.\xc2\xa0 It is not a good in its own right.\xc2\xa0 The focus here is on growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also another topic.\xc2\xa0 President Medvedev said Russia would help mediate in Libya and even help with a Qaddafi exit strategy.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration been in touch with the Russians?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the President met with President Medvedev in France.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President met with him, I believe, in Italy.\xc2\xa0 We are in constant consultation with our Russian counterparts and partners, and with other allies and partners who are interested in a positive solution to Libya so that the Libyan people can decide their own future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on different proposals by different countries, except that we support the idea that Muammar Qaddafi needs to step down so that the Libyans can chose their own leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked to Medvedev since the Europe trip?\xc2\xa0 Has there been any communication about this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, without saying or suggesting that this was a focus of their conversation, the President -- the Vice President did meet with him when he met with Prime Minister Berlusconi in Rome.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did it come up in their conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of that conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, is the President going to Russia this year?\xc2\xa0 Any plans?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ari.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the deadline for commanders to get the recommendation to the President on the AfPak --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no deadline.\xc2\xa0 The transition will begin in July of 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presumably --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The drawdown, rather.\xc2\xa0 The transition has already begun.\xc2\xa0 The drawdown will begin in July 2011.\xc2\xa0 You heard it from the best source possible.\xc2\xa0 The President said he would make that decision soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t said, give me at least a week before July to think about it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, July has 31 days in it.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, soon is pretty soon.\xc2\xa0 I mean, soon is spoken by the Commander-in-Chief -- I think you can expect that to be soon.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, he said yesterday that he spoke with Germany about taking an active role in a post-Qaddafi Libya.\xc2\xa0 What other plans is the U.S. making for what happens in Libya after a Qaddafi departure?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s part of wise planning to consider the future that we hope to help bring about with the varied actions that we have taken, both diplomatically, economically, unilaterally, multilaterally, and as well as militarily through the NATO mission.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we are consulting with our allies, with the contact group that has been stood up to look at this issue; consulting with and talking with the transitional council about Libya\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics about how that will unfold once Qaddafi leaves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, if he were to leave in the next 10 minutes, is there a whole list of things that immediately click into place?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of myself or the administration here, but you can be sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously thinking about and planning for that contingency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee report, it\xe2\x80\x99s being read in some quarters as a fairly -- as a very critical assessment of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Being read that way in one newspaper I think, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- counterinsurgency policy.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it\xe2\x80\x99s raising new questions about that policy that was adopted back in 2009.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of times what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now is not new policy.\xc2\xa0 But in the pace of drawdown, that\xe2\x80\x99s a recalibration of that policy.\xc2\xa0 In other words, the faster you get small, the more counterterrorism you get, the less counterinsurgency you get.\xc2\xa0 First, is the White House reading it that way, as an indictment of counterinsurgency policy than the maximalist approach that was favored by General McChrystal and General Petraeus?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think we welcome the report, even though we disagree with some of its conclusions, first.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen back on a shorthand that -- and you and I have had this discussion offline a number of times -- that I just simply don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it represents the consultations and review that the President undertook with his AfPak policy.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent the outcome.\xc2\xa0 This was never a binary choice between counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.\xc2\xa0 It was always about getting the right mix of approaches to ensure that we had the best possible chance of succeeding and achieving our goals -- disrupting, dismantling, and ultimately defeating al Qaeda and stabilizing Afghanistan sufficiently so Afghanistan would not again become a harbor for terrorists -- international terrorists who seek to do America and our allies harm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So -- and those are very -- those goals are very important because of what is included within them and what is not.\xc2\xa0 And the policy the President chose and has been implementing since December of 2009 is not -- you cannot describe it or thumbnail it by calling it counterinsurgency or counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of different elements that are part of it, that were specifically decided on because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief that they would maximize the chances of success.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Without using those terms, do the questions that the report raise help those arguing right now for a faster drawdown --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- let me just stop you there.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- we welcome the report.\xc2\xa0 It has got a lot of information in it; it is certainly worth reading and reviewing.\xc2\xa0 We spend a lot of time here on Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the national security staff, the national security team, and obviously our personnel, both civilian and military over in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are, again, very clear-eyed about the challenges in Afghanistan, about the progress that has been made, but also about the setbacks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced at various times.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that we know everything already and therefore don\xe2\x80\x99t need outside inputs.\xc2\xa0 We obviously do and welcome them.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not learning a great deal of information about the challenges that we face in Afghanistan here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And all of that is part of how the President has been thinking about Afghanistan and Pakistan since he got into office and even before.\xc2\xa0 It was all part of how he viewed the process when he settled on the strategy that he\xe2\x80\x99s implementing now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I would just go back to what I said before.\xc2\xa0 The decision -- implementing the drawdown -- beginning the drawdown is implementing the policy that he decided on in December of 2009.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a change; it is exactly what he said he would do.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of consistency here in terms of how this President operates.\xc2\xa0 He said what he would do and he\xe2\x80\x99s doing what he said, very deliberately, with his eye on a long-term goal here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what this process is about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I come back to Syria?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a U.N. resolution that the British and the French have proposed today condemning the regime for the crackdown.\xc2\xa0 Will America vote for that?\xc2\xa0 Do we agree with the British and the French that Bashar Assad is now losing -- present tense, is what they said -- losing his legitimacy?\xc2\xa0 And I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d still like a feel for what we think is going on there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s reports of troops and tanks heading for the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of all the reports, and sometimes information, depending on the region or the country, can be hard to come by or hard to verify.\xc2\xa0 But I think I put pretty starkly:\xc2\xa0 President Assad can either lead this transition that has to happen, or he has to step aside.\xc2\xa0 And I think our -- how we view this is pretty clearly stated in that sentence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a position to give you on the resolution that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that we have strongly condemned what the Syrian regime has been doing -- the murders and the arrests of its own people -- speaks pretty clearly about our position.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken in terms of sanctions, including targeting President Assad himself, I think are very clear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a pending humanitarian crisis in northern Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Maybe -- I mean, the State Department, you might ask them, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates in Afghanistan has called for a troop composition that would rely on shooters and -- saying that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to withdraw some personnel it should be support people.\xc2\xa0 He called for keeping a maximum combat capability in Afghanistan, called that a no-brainer.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that assessment from his Defense Secretary?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President speaks with and consults with his Defense Secretary all the time, including the weekly meetings that I just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 And the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President shares that opinion that the reductions we need to make need to be -- that he will make, the drawdown that will begin, will ensure that we can get the maximum success out of the mission.\xc2\xa0 And part of the mission and part of the strategy is to begin this drawdown as we transfer responsibility, security lead, over to the Afghan national security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But in terms of the composition of the block of troops that will begin the drawdown, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an opinion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s to convey to you because, as you know, the President is reviewing or will review his options and make a decision in the near future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that part of the decision that the President will make, is the troops -- the folks that will be coming home or reassigned, whether they\xe2\x80\x99ll be combat people or support people?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President will be getting into the decision at that level?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think some of these about how you -- in terms of a force the size of which we have in Afghanistan and what the breakdown is in terms of -- I think anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s in combat -- I mean, who\xe2\x80\x99s in that zone in an American military uniform is combat trained and fully capable of using a weapon.\xc2\xa0 So I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of a misnomer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I mean, there was -- we went through this when we were withdrawing troops from Afghanistan [Iraq], the suggestion that because we were ending our combat mission somehow that meant the troops that remained were not combat troops.\xc2\xa0 Obviously every U.S. soldier and military personnel is highly skilled and trained in combat.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, the -- but, again, I think that the breakdown of how that works, the proportion of either support or logistical or analytical strength versus frontline combat strength, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Pentagon is better suited to answer that question.*</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has faced a bit of criticism from more liberal economists and Democrats on how he\xe2\x80\x99s allowed -- they accuse him or say he\xe2\x80\x99s allowed the debate on the deficit and debt, the economy, to shift too much towards cutting government spending and he\xe2\x80\x99s given up ground on the need to push more stimulus measures.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any -- can you react to that criticism that the President has gone too far in favor of Republicans on this debate, where the debate is on their terms, especially in light of this jobs report?\xc2\xa0 And then second, whether, because of the jobs report, he sees any need to reevaluate his goal of cutting $4 trillion in spending over 12 years, or just that big goal that he set out.\xc2\xa0 In light of that report, is there any need to change?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two points.\xc2\xa0 One, I think going to the point about we need to look at trends here and not just one piece of or several pieces of economic data.\xc2\xa0 And the trend remains very positive -- 2.1 million private sector jobs -- in excess of 2.1 million private sector jobs created over 15 months, and sustained economic growth for seven months -- seven quarters, rather.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So in terms of measures that are helping fuel economic activity and growth, he fought very hard for and achieved, as part of the tax cut compromise in December, extension of uninsurance -- unemployed benefits -- unemployment benefits and obviously the middle-class tax cut, as well as the payroll tax cut -- the payroll tax holiday.\xc2\xa0 That is -- in terms of the discussions that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, that is direct stimulus through tax reduction in a payroll tax cut, which we believe is much more efficient in terms of causing economic growth than giving very wealthy Americans more tax cuts, because that money won\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be pumped back into the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the President also believes -- and this is not like choosing between I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go more Democratic or more Republican -- the President believes that balanced deficit reduction is in the American interest -- in the interest of the economy and in the interest of job creation.\xc2\xa0 He is not apologetic about that.\xc2\xa0 He thinks we need to do it and he thinks we need to do it in a balanced way, in a way that protects important investments, that protects our seniors and disabled children and others.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that if you do it in a balanced way, you can protect our core commitments, you can make the key investments we need to make, and you can bring down our deficit by $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut will expire at the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 Is there a need, as part of this negotiations that are going on, to extend that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President addressed this in broad terms the other day, yesterday, about what discussions might be in the future about that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond what he said yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he referencing -- he seemed to hint at it -- was he referencing an extension of that tax cut?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to expand beyond what he said on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Syria policy before in the context of \xe2\x80\x9cevery country within the Middle East is different,\xe2\x80\x9d but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell us specifically what it is about Syria that leads the President not to call specifically for Assad to step down.\xc2\xa0 What is it about that country, about the geopolitical situation there, that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just repeat what I said.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, we believe, the administration has stated as I just stated, that President Assad needs to lead this transition or get out of the way.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear statement of where we stand.\xc2\xa0 The comparison games aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- these are specific countries with specific circumstances with different things happening in terms of the expressions of dissatisfaction by people on the streets and the reaction that the governments have had.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And each country deserves a specific response -- all geared towards our hope of the best possible outcome, and that can be condemning actions, putting pressure on leadership -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking broadly, depending on the country you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- offering different forms of support to opposition.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about Syria but I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about the different options available to us -- taking actions multilaterally with allies, unilaterally through sanctions and that kind of thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I just -- there is not a one-size-fits-all response here because, as you know, the region is very diverse.\xc2\xa0 The nature of the regimes and the countries is extremely varied.\xc2\xa0 And we have to take that into account as we develop policy with regard to each country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you know, I think -- what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, what is there specifically about Syria that leads to this particular policy?\xc2\xa0 Is there some concern of destability within the region or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing an approach towards Syria which we hope will help lead to a positive outcome, which is either the current regime changing its behavior dramatically and engaging in political dialogue, ceasing the violence and leading the transition, or in that transition taking place under different circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just very lastly, on that.\xc2\xa0 There would be a lot of people who would be skeptical that someone -- I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s just killed more than a thousand of his own people -- can do that kind of transition, can have negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Why does the White House think that he can sort of suddenly change and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more in the -- yes, Victoria.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 You said the President yesterday spoke broadly about payroll taxes and manufacturing incentives.\xc2\xa0 But right after saying that he also said he was interested in exploring with Congress the continuation of some of these policies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I just said is that I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the President\xe2\x80\x99s words stand.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on India?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Oh, wait, Chris.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, in June 2009 the Department of Homeland Security issued a memorandum on deporting certain widows and widowers of U.S. citizens.\xc2\xa0 At the time, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that, \xe2\x80\x9csmart immigration policy balances strong enforcement practices with the common-sense practical solutions to complicated issues.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Yet, in May, asked about requests by advocates for a moratorium on deportation of foreign partners and same-sex binational relationships, similar to the 2009 moratorium, you said the President can\xe2\x80\x99t just wave a wand and change the law.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the difference there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean -- the President can\xe2\x80\x99t just wave a wand and then change the law.\xc2\xa0 I think that was in response to a broader set of issues that some folks are understandably advocating for --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it was specifically about the issue of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the President has called for comprehensive immigration reform for a reason, because he thinks that we need to move in a comprehensive way to get there, and -- because that kind of comprehensive approach has in the past enjoyed bipartisan support, and he believes that if we talk about it in the right way and we push for it, and folks out in the country push for it, that we can return to a situation where there will be bipartisan support for it again in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 2:28 P.M.
