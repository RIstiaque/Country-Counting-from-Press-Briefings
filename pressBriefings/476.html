CDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday to you all.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us aboard Air Force One as we return from Chicago to Joint Base Andrews and then to the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I know you\xe2\x80\x99re aware that the President will be making a personnel announcement later today from the White House, announcing that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to nominate current HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan to be his next OMB Director, and Mayor Julian Castro to replace Shaun as HUD Director.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s excited about both nominations, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from him today about them.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there are some assurances apparently from Russian President Putin that he is going to work with the elected government in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how confident the President is of those and whether he has or is planning to talk with Mr. Putin before the elections.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no new conversations to read out between the President and President Putin, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any plans for President Obama to reach -- to speak with President Putin in the next several days before the May 25th elections in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>We did see the comments by President Putin, and he said a lot of things about Ukraine -- many things that we profoundly disagree with.\xc2\xa0 But we would welcome an indication from Russia that they will accept the results of a free and fair democratic election in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that would be the case.\xc2\xa0 And we further urge Russia to use its influence to persuade separatists in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere to vacate buildings they\xe2\x80\x99ve occupied, to lay down their weapons, to cease the activities that they\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in that have caused violence and instability in those parts of Ukraine, and instead to participate in the democratic process in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see whether, in fact, Russia does recognize and then take steps to engage with the Ukrainian government and the victor of the presidential election.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s ability to carry out that election freely and fairly.\xc2\xa0 And we appreciate the efforts of the OSCE in assisting Ukraine to help that come about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask about Mayor Castro?\xc2\xa0 What would you say to a skeptical member of the public who would be concerned that this is a stepping stone to national office for Mayor Castro rather than someone who will focus their full attention to the needs of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s transportation system?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that Mayor Castro is highly qualified to bring to scale his success over five years as mayor of San Antonio to the federal level.\xc2\xa0 His record in San Antonio speaks for itself, and it has been recognized in many areas, including in terms of urban development and housing, as well as education and successfully attracting business investment.</p>\n<p>The President thinks Julian Castro will make an excellent next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask a similar question about Shaun Donovan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been -- I mean, his entire career he\xe2\x80\x99s been an advocate for affordable housing and working on housing issues.\xc2\xa0 So how does that translate to running OMB and being the Budget Director and taking on that role?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Shaun has been an exceptionally successful director of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\xc2\xa0 Under his leadership, HUD has helped stabilize the housing market and worked to keep responsible families in their homes.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of the crisis, Secretary Donovan reaffirmed HUD\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to building strong, sustainable, inclusive neighborhoods that are connected to education and jobs and provide access and opportunity to all Americans.\xc2\xa0 He made critical investments to speed economic growth while offering new savings proposals and ensuring fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>He also, as you know, took on the significant task of chairing the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, which developed a comprehensive regional plan based on local vision for redevelopment to guide long-term disaster recovery efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Shaun has a track record of using data to make good decisions and drive results, very much like Director Burwell, who will be his predecessor.\xc2\xa0 He has extensive experience managing large federal budgets and financial management systems, and he has a proven track record of implementing evidence-based reforms to deliver impact for working families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think he\xe2\x80\x99s very qualified, based on his long experience, including for the past five-plus years as Secretary of a Cabinet agency, to be the next OMB Director.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the Veterans Affairs investigation, is Rob Nabors back from Phoenix?\xc2\xa0 Is he still in Phoenix?\xc2\xa0 Has he reported back to the President?\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to the President about it?\xc2\xa0 And secondly, what would you say to critics who say the administration isn\xe2\x80\x99t tackling this urgently enough?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to VA for an update on Rob\xe2\x80\x99s travels.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question, whether he is still in Phoenix.\xc2\xa0 I think we read out or previewed some of the meetings he was going to have and the work he was going to do there, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the VA for more details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He has not reported to the President yet because, as the President said a few days ago, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be reporting to the President next week a preliminary report -- or, sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting my reviews confused.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Shinseki will be reporting preliminary results of his review next week.\xc2\xa0 Rob is conducting a longer, broader overview of operations at the VA, including at the VHA.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls or conversations to read out between the President and Rob on this matter.</p>\n<p>On the other one -- I think I would simply note that the President ordered Secretary Shinseki to conduct this review.\xc2\xa0 He supported Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation that the independent IG conduct an investigation.\xc2\xa0 He dispatched one of his most trusted advisors to the VA to assist with Secretary Shinseki\xe2\x80\x99s review of the specific allegations surrounding wait times, and to conduct a broader review of VA and VHA operations.\xc2\xa0 So I think that reflects the seriousness with which the President treats these matters and the seriousness with which he takes the sacred trust that he believes we all have and he, of course, as Commander-In-Chief especially has to ensure that as a nation we\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of our veterans, providing the benefits and services to our veterans that they have earned and deserve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be meeting with some vets as part of the Memorial Day observation?\xc2\xa0 Anything that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t announced yet that you can give us a preview of?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details at this time of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for Memorial Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that the White House has been having meetings with lawmakers about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that you can tell us about that and what the objective is there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific meetings to read out, but senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, including the President himself, regularly engage with leaders and rank-and-file members of both Houses to discuss matters of national security and foreign policy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case now.</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any reaction to the fact that Senator Corker seemed to call the meetings \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was so bizarre about the meetings?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President talk about his foreign policy at his speech at West Point next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair assumption given the setting that national security would be something the President would talk about at West Point.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s a signing of a bill in the Oval Office this afternoon that is stills only.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to wonder why TV cameras are not being allowed in, editorial is not being allowed in.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President right after that is going to be in front of TV cameras and in front of all of you when he makes his personnel announcement.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the -- what are they called -- the Doolittle Raiders, the folks that he\xe2\x80\x99s honoring and signing and bill. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s still photos -- we\xe2\x80\x99re making that available to still photographers.\xc2\xa0 But again, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in front of cameras and speaking in front of all of you shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the very animated conversation the President had with Mayor Emanuel at the landing zone yesterday, is there anything you can say about what they were talking about and why the President was so animated in ways we rarely see him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve known Rahm since 1993.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a conversation with him that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t animated.\xc2\xa0 So I think it rubs off on all of us.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know that it was anything more than a couple of friends and former colleagues catching up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know what the President did last night?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He stayed at his residence.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know -- I don\'t have any information about like what he did there, but I know he -- this morning I was talking to him.\xc2\xa0 He said it was just really nice to be back in Chicago.\xc2\xa0 He enjoyed his OTR this morning and just being back, especially at this time of year when Chicago on a sunny day and a warm day is really -- rivals any city in the world in terms of beauty and overall niceness -- I think.\xc2\xa0 I thought it was great.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even D.C.?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 D.C. is great too, but before it gets all humid and sticky.\xc2\xa0 In the spring, D.C. is wonderful.\xc2\xa0 But I just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- missing all the other cities --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I just said it\xe2\x80\x99s up there at the top at this time of year.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve always found, and the President and I were talking about it, that when the lake is sort of shimmering and the air feels fresh and clean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty much a warm-weather resident now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s bringing the Hawaii to Chicago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about the -- he did talk about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been back to Chicago in other seasons, but I don\'t think you\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised to know that spring and summer are his favorites in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned real quickly that President Putin had said a lot of stuff, not just the stuff about intending to honor the outcome of the elections, and that the U.S. disagreed with a lot of it.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything beyond what we already know you disagree with that you want to highlight?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, his description of what happened when the previous President left office, vacated his office, and suggesting that the United States and other countries supported a coup, well, that just doesn\'t square with the facts.\xc2\xa0 We all know what the facts are.</p>\n<p>There was an agreement that the President was supposed sign.\xc2\xa0 He had 24 hours to sign it, and instead of signing it, he disappeared and left the city, left the office vacated.\xc2\xa0 And then the democratically elected parliament overwhelmingly -- including the members of his own party -- overwhelmingly voted to support the new government.\xc2\xa0 Those facts are hard to reconcile with the view expressed by President Putin of what happened in Kyiv that led to that transition of power.</p>\n<p>And right away, keeping its commitments, the new transitional government called for new presidential elections on May 25, and lo and behold, there will be presidential elections -- free and fair democratic elections on May 25, which is a good thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I got that paper.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it to you when we get to Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:02 A.M.
