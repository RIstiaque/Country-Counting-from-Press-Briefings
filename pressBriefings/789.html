EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to gather in this setting once again after a few weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, we\'re headed to Hatfield, Pennsylvania, where the President will tour the K\'NEX workshop, visit with some workers at that facility, and of course deliver some remarks.\xc2\xa0 In those remarks, he will make clear that any deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff will require higher tax rates for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.\xc2\xa0 He will also call on House Republicans to act expeditiously to vote on something very rare in Washington, D.C. these days:\xc2\xa0 a policy that has strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 He wants House Republicans to do what the Senate has already done -- enact legislation that will prevent an income-tax hike on 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of American small businesses at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Preventing this tax hike isn\xe2\x80\x99t just good for middle-class families, it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for businesses like K\'NEX.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is ready to sign that bill as soon as it passes the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as you point out, the President is asking for those tax rates for the -- and tax cuts for upper-income Americans to go back up, but that alone only generates about $848 billion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 The President apparently is asking for about $1.6 trillion, at least in the offer that the Republicans made public yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Why is the President asking for double the amount that has been kind of the marker for revenue in past discussions with the House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my sense is, is that the marker for revenue that the President has discussed for quite some time now -- it was included in the defense-reduction package that the President rolled out in the Rose Garden in September 2011, the marker that was laid out in the President\'s budget that was presented in February of 2012, and the marker that was presented in the context of the balanced approach to deficit reduction that the President advocated throughout the campaign -- was $1.6 trillion in tax revenue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are specific policies that the President had laid out that would do this that would prevent those who are making less than $250,000 a year from having to pay higher taxes.\xc2\xa0 What this does is this is the way that we can ask the wealthiest Americans to pay a little bit more to deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has campaigned on for quite some time, it\'s what got a strong endorsement of the American people in the election, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is pushing for in the context of these discussions with House Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 $1.6 trillion is negotiable or it can go down?\xc2\xa0 It can be much lower than that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to negotiate it from here, but the President has laid out a clear and specific path for asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more to deal with our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 This is part of a balanced approach that includes some proposals to reform entitlements, to make cuts in government spending.\xc2\xa0 And that balanced approach is what the President is advocating -- not just because it will do something important for our deficit challenges, which it will do; it will reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years -- but most importantly, what it will do is it will actually lay the foundation for a strong and vibrant American economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on -- a strong economy, an economy where middle-class families have the opportunity to succeed, and an economy that will support the kinds of policies that will create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Those are the President\'s priorities, and those are the priorities that the President is pursuing in the context of these negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you release a copy of Secretary Geithner\'s plan? And can you tell us --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It sounds like the Republicans already did that last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we would like to have it from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you guys will release?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll talk about it.\xc2\xa0 But here is the thing:\xc2\xa0 there is nothing that is -- was included in those discussions that is going to come as a surprise to you.\xc2\xa0 I know that there were comments from House Republican staffers and Republican staffers on Capitol Hill who expressed surprise at the President\'s proposal.\xc2\xa0 And I have to admit that this morning I was surprised that they were surprised.</p>\n<p>Again, what Secretary Geithner talked to them about yesterday were exactly the kinds of things that the President has been talking about for well over a year.\xc2\xa0 I would be willing to bet the President actually made a reference to this balanced approach deficit reduction in every single speech that he gave in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Every single one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason for anybody to be surprised here.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at the paper, but what the President has articulated and what Secretary Geithner discussed yesterday is something that we have discussed publicly for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the $400 billion in entitlement savings -- can you give us a little more detail about what changes you\'re proposing there?\xc2\xa0 And will the President talk with Speaker Boehner today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to walk through every single detail of our proposal.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are some things that are included in there that we -- that are -- that, again, have been on the table for quite some time, including in our Fiscal Year 2013 budget proposal that was presented in February of 2012.\xc2\xa0 But this includes things like $100 billion in savings for Medicare prescription drugs.\xc2\xa0 Medicare can purchase -- use their bargaining power to make prescription drug purchases more efficient.\xc2\xa0 We can save $100 billion by doing that.\xc2\xa0 The President has also included in his budget asking wealthy seniors to pay a little bit more Medicare payments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a number of ways that we can -- including placing reforms to Medicare.\xc2\xa0 Now, the key to this is the President wants to ensure that these reforms will actually strengthen the programs and extend the life of these programs over the long term.\xc2\xa0 And these are the kinds of things, again, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about for quite some time, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about -- and have also been the substance of the discussions that Secretary Geithner and Rob Nabors had yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\'ve been talking about it for a long time, the word you used is "surprised."\xc2\xa0 Why go in with that proposal?\xc2\xa0 I mean, were you surprised that the Republicans didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the proposal that was presented to Republicans yesterday has the strong support of the majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0 This is the -- this is what -- this is the approach that the President has talked about for a long time now.\xc2\xa0 This is an approach that garnered the President a lot of support in the election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I know that there are some Republicans who have remarked that they feel like they\xe2\x80\x99re a long way from where the President is on this.\xc2\xa0 That also means those Republicans are a long way from where the American people are on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This also means that you all are a long way from finding a compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This means that in order to get a compromise done, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have people on the other side of the aisle who are willing to set aside their partisan interests and work with the President in bipartisan fashion to act in the best interests of the American economy.</p>\n<p>Now, here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 I know that there have also been House Republicans and Senate Republicans who have expressed some dismay and some concern about meeting the deadline.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not that far apart.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very clear what we need to do to get this done.\xc2\xa0 It is a bipartisan approach.\xc2\xa0 It has the strong support of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to get it done.</p>\n<p>So all we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting on right now is House Republicans to acknowledge one very simple thing, which is that tax rates on the wealthy must go up to get this deal done.\xc2\xa0 That is a critical part of a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a critical part of the balanced approach that has the strong support of the American people, and once that fact is acknowledged, then we can get this done pretty quick.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the U.N. upgrade of the Palestine status, is the United States planning any immediate steps to, say, withdraw funding from U.N. agencies, or other reactions that are substantive?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What we have talked about and what Ambassador Rice articulated yesterday was our opposition to that vote in the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 Our opposition is based on one thing, which is our belief that a solution to this long conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only be resolved by face-to-face negotiations that will result in a Palestinian state and an Israeli state living side by side in peace and security.</p>\n<p>That is the ultimate goal, and it is our view that that goal will be achieved only through face-to-face negotiations not through unilateral actions like we saw yesterday at the U.N.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the fiscal cliff, can you say why a -- you would expect -- you\'re surprised that -- congressional surprise not withstanding -- why you would expect them to accept a unilateral ability to raise the debt ceiling without their approval?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 I think even my Republican friends on Capitol Hill would acknowledge that the roiling, wrenching debt-limit process that this country went through in the summer of 2011 was not in the best interests of our economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interests of taxpayers -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even in the best interest of the global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what was -- what did come out of that process, though, the debt-ceiling negotiations in August 2011, was a workable mechanism that I believe was proposed by Senator McConnell to ensure that politics doesn\'t get injected into the process and that we can have a manageable way of dealing with the debt limit that doesn\'t put at risk the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable that the President would propose to continue using that process moving forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the administration\'s proposal on the debt ceiling was -- mirrored Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s approach from the previous negotiation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, basically, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you would do it in tranches just like you did the last one?\xc2\xa0 It was --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go through the full details here, but as I mentioned, through the wrenching process of August 2011, Senator McConnell proposed a workable process, a manageable process that ensured that we could deal with the debt limit in a way that didn\'t allow either side -- and in the case of August 2011, the House Republicans -- to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That had terrible consequences for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It had bad consequences for the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And the process that\'s been in place for the last year or so has avoided that from happening.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that we would extend it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you comment separately on the adoption of a constitution in Egypt?\xc2\xa0 It\'s resulted in more protests on the street and some concerns that it\xe2\x80\x99s too much of an Islamic document.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t reviewed any of the details of what has apparently been -- is working its way through the process there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we have said all along is that we wanted to support the Egyptian people through the process; that they would have a constitutional document and a government that reflected the will of the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 And that has been our interest from the beginning -- a government that reflects the will of the people; that respects racial, religious and ethnic minorities.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of principles that we\xe2\x80\x99ve espoused not just in Egypt, but in other countries throughout the region.</p>\n<p>But in terms of a reaction to this specific document, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any week ahead for us before we go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to land here so everybody hold on for a second.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stand on perfect landings.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame her.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s opposed to it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through this quick.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will host Prime Minister Borisov of Bulgaria at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President welcomes the opportunity to discuss a broad range of bilateral and regional issues during their Oval Office meeting, including Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s leadership at NATO and its valuable contributions to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President also looks forward to receiving updates on Bulgaria\xe2\x80\x99s investigation into the July 2012 terrorist attack in Burgas, and ongoing rule of law and judicial actions.</p>\n<p>Later that day, the President will deliver remarks to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Symposium being held at the National Defense University.\xc2\xa0 On the 20th anniversary of the CTR program, the President will note the extraordinary progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made in securing nuclear material, thanks to Senators Nunn and Lugar for their -- and thank Senators Nunn and Lugar for their longstanding leadership on these issues.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will meet with governors at the White House, where they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss the actions we need to take to keep our economy growing and find a balanced approach to reduce our deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will deliver remarks to members of the Business Roundtable.\xc2\xa0 Later that day he\xe2\x80\x99ll also deliver remarks to the 2012 Tribal Nations Conference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President and the First Family will attend the National Christmas Tree Lighting on the Ellipse.</p>\n<p>And on Friday, the President will participate in the ever-popular meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the meeting with governors bipartisan governors?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it all of the governors?\xc2\xa0 Do we know which governors, in other words.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe that some of the invites have gone out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have the final list, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that in advance of the meeting we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to give you a list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President talk to Boehner or McConnell today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to read out but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you keep us posted?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I will try.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President will regularly have phone consultations with Congress that we don\xe2\x80\x99t often -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t read out every one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or often.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what was the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the U.N. vote?\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise, obviously, but what\xe2\x80\x99s his level of concern about the impact this could have on the peace process?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal views here are reflective of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position, which is that these kinds of unilateral actions are not helpful.\xc2\xa0 This is only going to get resolved through face-to-face bilateral negotiations between the parties.\xc2\xa0 The goal here is a two-state -- is two states, one Israeli, one Palestinian, living side by side in peace and security.\xc2\xa0 And unilateral actions like this don\xe2\x80\x99t advance that effort, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not just the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal view.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think you said that the administration is not considering cutting off aid --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to the P.A., but are there other consequences maybe under consideration, like perhaps having to do with their mission in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I have to report out at this time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the reason for that is simply that our aid to the Palestinians is an important part of our relationship.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that we can -- the United States can and should play a constructive role in facilitating negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 So we want to make sure that we have an open channel with both sides.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of any specific actions that are being contemplated, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if a bill came to his desk that cut off aid he\xe2\x80\x99d veto it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- veto threats.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s moving through Congress on that front.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is that it is not our view that cutting off aid is the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you shortly, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Geithner or anybody on the Hill today of that high level?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 There is actually one other thing that I forgot, which is just that Senator Casey and Congresswoman Schwartz are both on the plane today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any business leaders on the plane as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:06 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
