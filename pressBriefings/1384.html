CEST</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re just going to take you quickly through the day, answer a few questions.\xc2\xa0 We have not a ton of time because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do a meeting in here with the President in a little more than about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We could just stay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He appreciates the offer to share his conference room.</p>\n<p>Just have Ben walk you guys through what the President has on his schedule, what he\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 I will say this -- I\'ll send around a post that went up on the White House blog overnight from Brian McKeon, who is with the Office of the Vice President, but also works for the NSC.\xc2\xa0 Brian was formerly the chief counsel for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and will be heading up our efforts to see the treaty ratified through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a blog posted that discusses a little bit about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the treaty, what the use of terms like unilateral language means, and some particulars around that.</p>\n<p>The treaty will be made publicly available later today.\xc2\xa0 We will post that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something you send around, or how does that get posted?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s rather large, so we\'ll put it up</p>\n<p>-- I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to put it up on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 And then starting later today members of our negotiating team will begin briefing on the specifics of the treaty to the Senate.</p>\n<p>I\'ve said this a few times in my briefings and I\'ll get you these exact years and votes, but if you look back at previous nuclear reduction treaties in the late \xe2\x80\x9880s, the early \xe2\x80\x9890s, and even as late at 2003, these are documents that enjoy vast bipartisan majorities -- votes in the \xe2\x80\x9890s.\xc2\xa0 We are hopeful that reducing the threat of nuclear weapons remains a priority for both parties.</p>\n<p>So with that, let me have Ben walk you guys through a little bit of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see today.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And just to add to what Robert said, we\'ll have fact sheets on different parts of the treaty, different key areas of the treaty that we should be able to share with you.\xc2\xa0 And then I\'d just also add, too, that the consultations with the Senate have been ongoing, so we\'ve been in consultation obviously throughout this process.\xc2\xa0 And today we\'ll have a chance to brief on the full text of the treaty and the protocol.</p>\n<p>So just to walk through the day, when we arrive we\'ll go to the Prague Castle, where there will be a welcome ceremony with President Klaus.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re being hosted by our very close friend and ally, the Czech Republic, and President Klaus will greet President Obama in a signing ceremony there.</p>\n<p>Then the President will head right into his bilateral meeting with President Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 This will be an opportunity of course to mark the conclusion of the START treaty, to discuss some issues related to that, but also to cover a broad agenda of issues between the United States and Russia on which we\'re cooperating.</p>\n<p>The President will have a smaller bilateral meeting with President Medvedev and then an expanded bilateral meeting with --</p>\n<p>(the President comes in.)</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, he\xe2\x80\x99s doing a really good job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I was impressed.\xc2\xa0 It sounded like he knew what he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want to take over, Mr. President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral -- I think we\'ll have a spray at the top of that, but they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously going to be making their statements later.</p>\n<p>Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll proceed to the signing ceremony, which is also at the Castle there.\xc2\xa0 President Medvedev and President Obama will sign the treaty.\xc2\xa0 Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll both make statements and have a press conference.\xc2\xa0 After the signing ceremony there\xe2\x80\x99s a ceremonial lunch, and that is the United States, Russia and the Czech Republic will be at that lunch to mark the occasion.</p>\n<p>Around this time, again --after the treaty is signed, I think that is when it will be released.\xc2\xa0 And again, I expect it will be posted on the web, and we\'ll see about having paper copies available.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is the treaty and the protocol.\xc2\xa0 So this will be the first time that that text has been made fully available.</p>\n<p>Then there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a break and at that time we\xe2\x80\x99ll I think have the opportunity to brief you more fully on the treaty with some of our negotiating team who will be there with us, as well as the bilateral meeting that the President had with President Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re going to head back to the hotel and do the briefing there.</p>\n<p>Then the final event of the day for the President is we are hosting a dinner for Central and Eastern European heads of state and heads of government.\xc2\xa0 There will be 11 leaders there:\xc2\xa0 Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovenia, Poland, the Slovak Republic, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, and then of course, the Czech Republic, and both the Prime Minister and the President will be there from the Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>The President wanted to take this opportunity since he was in Prague to have a dinner and multilateral discussion with these 11 close allies of the United States, to, again, discuss a range of issues on which we cooperate closely with them from the global economy to European security, to how we\'re cooperating around the world, in Afghanistan and other places.\xc2\xa0 These are all, of course, NATO allies.</p>\n<p>And that\'s it.\xc2\xa0 At that dinner I think we\'ll have a pooled arrival and then the dinner itself will be a closed working dinner where they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss a range of issues.\xc2\xa0 I imagine we\'ll have some kind of a readout to the dinner as well for you guys.</p>\n<p>So that\'s the day.\xc2\xa0 And then the next morning, before we leave the President will have a bilateral meeting with the Czechs, with both the President and Prime Minister together, before we take off on Friday morning.</p>\n<p>So that the schedule, and I\'ll take a couple of questions if anybody has any.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- expects the bilateral meeting with Medvedev to focus heavily on Iran.\xc2\xa0 How much progress do you expect the President to be able to make on that issue with the Russians?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Russians have been a close partner with us throughout the process of the P5-plus-1 negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen President Medvedev be in line with President Obama in both his statements and his approach in terms of providing Iranians with an opportunity to change course but also saying that there will have to be consequences if they don\'t.</p>\n<p>The Russians are currently negotiating with us for a multilateral sanctions regime in New York, so currently we\'re in multilateral negotiations where we believe we\'ll have a sanctions resolution this spring.\xc2\xa0 This will be an opportunity for them to discuss those negotiations and discuss recent developments as it relates to Iran, but again, those negotiations are now in a multilateral basis in New York.\xc2\xa0 So while -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an important opportunity for them to consult and I think to continue to discuss the progress of those negotiations.</p>\n<p>And again, what we\'ve said and what I think we\xe2\x80\x99d underscore again today is that when the President took office relations with Russia were at a -- really at a post-Cold War low, and that in the pursuit of the START treaty I think says something about an important landmark in terms of arms control nuclear policy, but it also demonstrates that we believe we can work together with the Russians on issues of common interest.\xc2\xa0 And that would of course include Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked constructively with them on Iran.\xc2\xa0 That would include Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 It would also include economic and trade issues that we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be discussing as well.</p>\n<p>So there will be a range of issues discussed, to include Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that, again, the Russians have been good partners throughout this process at the P5-plus-1.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is issue number one?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s issue number one?\xc2\xa0 Is it Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think really issue number one is coming here to sign this treaty.\xc2\xa0 I mean, President Medvedev and President Obama really worked personally together on this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of you travel with us.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they -- I think they met seven times bilaterally, both in Moscow but then on the margins of multiple summits.\xc2\xa0 They spoke on the phone an additional seven times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is this eight?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 This would be eight, yes.\xc2\xa0 This should be their eighth meeting.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the two of them personally invested a lot of time and effort in.\xc2\xa0 So I think it was important for them to mark that achievement.</p>\n<p>The President, of course -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion of the kind of completion of that treaty and look to the future cooperation on these issues.</p>\n<p>President Medvedev is obviously coming to the nuclear security summit, and obviously President Obama just released an important document in the Nuclear Posture Review, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve consulted with the Russians in.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of nuclear non-proliferation and security issues I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss.</p>\n<p>Iran is obviously one of those, because as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say many times, for the non-proliferation regime to work effectively those who break the rules and fail to live up to their obligations have to be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 So I think Iran will be discussed in that context of a shared commitment that they have to non-proliferation and nuclear security.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be also a broader range of issues discussed.\xc2\xa0 Russia is cooperating in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The recent terrorist attacks in Russia, President Obama was able to express his condolences personally to President Medvedev by the phone.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to do that again in person today.\xc2\xa0 And then some issues related to economic growth and the G20 as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Iran, what\xe2\x80\x99s your best-case scenario coming out of this meeting, going into the meeting next week with Hu Jintao?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think these are important opportunities to discuss Iran bilaterally; to discuss Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued failure to live up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 But again, what I would underscore is that we\xe2\x80\x99re into a period of intense negotiations in New York. The Chinese are a part of those negotiations, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recently reported.\xc2\xa0 So a lot of those -- the details of that sanctions regime are being worked through in New York.</p>\n<p>So this is an opportunity for the President to consult on a leader-to-leader basis with his Russian counterpart.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have that opportunity with President Hu, and he also recently met with President Sarkozy.\xc2\xa0 He talked to Prime Minister Brown on the phone.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll also have an opportunity to talk to Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 So I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with each of the leaders to discuss the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made, but also the focal point of the negotiations right now is in New York, given the fact that all the P5-plus-1 is now at the table on this.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just underscore that -- because this goes to both the relationship that we have bilaterally with Russia but also the engagement that the President has undertaken over the course of 15 months, has brought us to the point where, as Ben just said, the P5-plus-1 is all actively at the table negotiating this, something that -- again, 15 months ago, the problem of Iran existed; what didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist was an international framework in the P5-plus-1 to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Through the President\xe2\x80\x99s both engagement with these countries bilaterally, multilaterally, and by the offers that have been made to Iran that have been turned down, the world has been brought together at a point that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at only a short time ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s the exact reason to ask these kinds of questions, is because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got these intense negotiations, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the parties at the table, so here the President is meeting with the two most important players in those negotiations in the span of, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, four days or five days, if I\'m doing the math right.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s got to want something out of that.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t just be, hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s stuff happening in New York.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- look, I think -- well, no, but the point of New York is that that\xe2\x80\x99s where the details -- I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re in a period of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is how you get to the end, is leaders come together and they figure out ways you can break through those talks, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess are you guys hoping that when the bilat ends today that President Medvedev says something specific to push --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at that point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re no longer coming out of these meetings where people are looking for whether the Russians or whether the Chinese are at a point where --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand, but -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 -- negotiate the specifics of a sanctions resolution.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to come out of here today and say, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement on -- because --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bilateral meeting, and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can they make any progress on Iran today?\xc2\xa0 Are they hoping to?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss it, but again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0 -- again, they\xe2\x80\x99re at a point where what wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible many months ago now is.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect any pronouncements today coming out of this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I do think the meeting upcoming with the Chinese leader is important and demonstrates, again, the approach that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to bring all our partners, including the Chinese, into these negotiations, and to have his important participation in the nuclear security summit, which, in many ways, builds off both the Nuclear Posture Review and the START treaty that we signed today, moving the agenda on reducing the threat of nuclear weapons forward.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just add to that, I mean, echoing what Robert said, President Medvedev has been clear for a time -- we would come out of these meetings, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been supportive of the need to move to sanctions if the Iranians continue to fail to live up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 So we believe the Russians are onboard with the sanctions effort.</p>\n<p>I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President express the importance of getting this done.\xc2\xa0 Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for them to discuss the importance of holding Iran accountable.\xc2\xa0 But what I would also say, though, is that, just echoing what Robert said, these consultations further isolate the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 I think the Nuclear Posture Review we released, which focused upon the Non-Proliferation Treaty as the central dividing line between those states that will have a negative security assurance and those states that don\xe2\x80\x99t, further isolates the Iranians and sends a message to them that they will not find greater security through the pursuit of a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a range of actions we\xe2\x80\x99re taking, of course, ongoing unilateral sanctions that we have on the Iranians, whose enforcement we\xe2\x80\x99ve tightened, and then of course these multilateral efforts at the United Nations, which, again, we believe should and will conclude this spring.</p>\n<p>So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole range of ways in which the international community is working to isolate Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I think that they\xe2\x80\x99ll cover that broad range in their discussions.\xc2\xa0 But of course the sanctions regime that is being negotiated will be a topic.\xc2\xa0 But again, as Robert said, the Russians are already committed to the notion of holding Iran accountable through the multilateral sanctions regime, and that\xe2\x80\x99s being worked hard in New York too.</p>\n<p>So I\'m not trying to downplay.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just -- we believe that they have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve got everybody onboard with maybe -- with talking about sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the really hard process of what do they look like; what can everybody agree on they\xe2\x80\x99ll say and they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the really difficult part that you\xe2\x80\x99re in right now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, and quite frankly it will play out in many places.\xc2\xa0 You know, Bill Burns and others actively engaged with their counterparts in the P5-plus-1; Ambassador Rice at the United Nations; as well as the President and his counterparts.</p>\n<p>So these are discussions that are happening I would say simultaneous, but it will be 3:00 a.m. on the East Coast, so maybe that would be too cute by half.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve got about one or two more minutes and then we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed on the situation in Kyrgyzstan and will that be playing any part in the discussions with various leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President has been kept informed about the situation in Kyrgyzstan throughout the day -- the day and a half.\xc2\xa0 And I do expect that that would come up, given the fact that both the United States and Russia have relations with Kyrgyzstan so I expect it will be a topic of discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of a fight are you guys expecting in the Senate for the START treaty?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think when the agreement was announced -- and again, I said this, I don\'t want to pre-judge votes here, but obviously the very strong statement that Senator Lugar issued about moving this process through the Senate quickly, which I know is important to many, including President Obama -- as I said, this is an issue that President Obama got involved in as a senator through a partnership with Senator Lugar.\xc2\xa0 Brian McKeon as I said, on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s staff and working with the NSC, will head up our efforts to get this through the Senate.</p>\n<p>And I would say again, this is an issue that, from Reagan to Clinton to Bush, has enjoyed bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why leaders like Secretary of State Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, Bill Perry put out supportive statements upon our conclusion a few weeks ago of this treaty.</p>\n<p>So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\'s hope and expectation, one, that the Senate will ratify this treaty this year, and secondly, that what has always been a strong bipartisan issue will continue to be so.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll send around the votes.\xc2\xa0 Again, the last three prominent nuclear reduction treaties that have gone through the Senate have passed with no less than 93 votes.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get an opportunity to see.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just add one thing to that.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates said this when the treaty rolled out, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve consulted with the Senate throughout this.\xc2\xa0 A couple of issues were of interest to a number of senators, included the missile defense and the stockpile management.\xc2\xa0 The treaty places no constraints on the development of our missile defense in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And similarly we\xe2\x80\x99ve made significant investments in the stockpile that we\xe2\x80\x99re very confident that we can actually strengthen the infrastructure of the stockpile and have a reliable nuclear deterrent with these reductions in deployed weapons and launchers.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that based upon our consultations with the Senate throughout this process that the final product of this treaty is very much in line with some of the issues that were expressed just by senators.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think before the August recess --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that I would set a timetable of before August.</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n9:03 A.M. CEST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
