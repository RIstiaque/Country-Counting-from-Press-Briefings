EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 The day that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for for so long is finally here.\xc2\xa0 The administration has released the budget.\xc2\xa0 You all have heard us talk about this quite a bit already.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what I am going to do is have my colleagues each make very short opening remarks to sort of talk about some of the highlights that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on in terms of putting the budget together, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reserve the bulk of the time here to taking your detailed questions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting off for weeks, but now we can finally go through them.</p>\n<p>So, Shaun, since you are the principal author here, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go first?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And I want to thank my colleagues -- Jason, Cecilia and Jeff -- for joining us as well today.\xc2\xa0 And let me begin with where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come from.\xc2\xa0 This budget comes on the heels of a breakthrough year for America.\xc2\xa0 In 58 months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve created over 11 million jobs, and our unemployment rate fell 1.2 percentage points from the previous year -- the largest annual decline in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 The number of uninsured Americans has dropped by an estimated 10 million, and we brought our deficits below 3 percent of GDP, less than the 40-year average.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This budget supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious vision for accelerating growth and expanding opportunity, and does so while meeting key fiscal tests of sustainability; reducing deficits to below 3 percent of GDP; and stabilizing debt as a share of the economy, and putting it on a declining path.\xc2\xa0 It achieves these goals by paying for all new investments, replacing mindless sequestration cuts with smart reforms, and achieves $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction, primarily from health tax and comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk primarily about the latter two prongs of our approach, and my colleagues will speak to some of the specific investments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In 2014, we began to move away from manufactured crises in austerity, helping to lay the groundwork for stronger growth and job market gains.\xc2\xa0 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, or Murray-Ryan, as it\xe2\x80\x99s widely known, reversed a portion of sequestration and allowed for higher investment levels in 2014 and 2015.\xc2\xa0 Not only has the Murray-Ryan agreement contributed to improving job market and accelerating growth, but it allowed for important investments in critical priorities, ranging from early education and manufacturing, to providing appropriate funding for national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that agreement expires at the end of this fiscal year, causing a return to sequestration in 2016 that would bring discretionary funding to its lowest level adjusted for inflation since 2006.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s despite the fact that since 2006 the U.S. population has grown by 7 percent, and costs in some key areas, such as Veterans Administration medical care, have grown much faster than inflation.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s despite important needs in national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Joint Chiefs have been very clear that a return to sequestration levels would significantly reduce the military\xe2\x80\x99s ability to fully implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s defense strategy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the budget proposes to end sequestration, fully reversing it for domestic priorities in 2016, matched by equal dollar increases for defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These investments are more than paid for with smart spending cuts, program integrity measures, and common-sense loophole closers.\xc2\xa0 The proposed increases in the discretionary budget caps will make room for a range of domestic and security investments that will help move the nation forward, including a number of investments my colleagues, Jeff and Cecilia, will discuss in a moment.</p>\n<p>And I want to emphasize again that every investment in the budget, both the discretionary investments made possible by reversing sequestration, and also the new and expanded tax credits for middle-class and working families, and mandatory investments that will expand access to community college and preschool -- all of them are fully paid for through spending or tax reforms.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the budget also achieves an additional $1.8 trillion in deficit reduction in the budget, primarily by focusing on the key drivers of our budget challenges -- health care cost growth and inadequate revenue levels in the face of an aging population.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, the budget includes about $400 billion in health savings that build on the Affordable Care Act, including measures that complement the administration\xe2\x80\x99s other efforts on delivery system reform that Secretary Burwell announced last week, and will help maintain the historic slowdown in health care cost growth while improving health care quality.</p>\n<p>The budget also raises about $640 billion in net revenue for deficit reduction from curbing high-income tax expenditures.\xc2\xa0 And this year\xe2\x80\x99s budget again reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform along the lines of the bipartisan Senate-passed bill.\xc2\xa0 In part because it helps balance out an aging population, immigration reform is good for the economy, for the Social Security Trust Fund, and our budget more broadly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Overall, the budget brings deficits down below 3 percent of the economy, while putting debt on a declining path.\xc2\xa0 It shows how we can build on the economic progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made over the last five years, and make investments to ensure that our country remains both strong and prosperous, while at the same time continuing our fiscal progress.</p>\n<p>With that, let me turn it over to Jason Furman, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to discuss the economic outlook and the budget assumptions.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 As Shaun noted, the U.S. economy strengthened considerably in 2014, with the strongest job growth in any calendar year since 1999.\xc2\xa0 Looking ahead, the administration expects that the economy will continue to grow at an above-trend rate of 3 percent per year in both 2015 and 2016.\xc2\xa0 This assumption is in line with the forecast from the Congressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip consensus, and is somewhat more conservative than the latest international monetary fund forecast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>While the economy has come a long way since the recession, the expectation of additional above-trend growth reflects the widely held view that the economy is still returning to the full utilization of its resources.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Several factors are supporting this growth.\xc2\xa0 Fiscal policy has shifted to a generally neutral stance, aided by the Ryan-Murray agreement reached at the end of 2013.\xc2\xa0 If Congress continues to act without brinksmanship or harmful austerity, fiscal policy will continue to be conducive to strong growth.\xc2\xa0 Consumer spending has picked up, reflecting the savings from the recent drop in energy prices.\xc2\xa0 The ongoing improvement in household finances and increased economic optimism.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s continued room for growth in both business and residential investment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The slowdown in growth for many of our key trading partners is, however, a headwind for the U.S. economy, and a downside risk to the near-term forecast.\xc2\xa0 In the later years of the forecast window, we assume that the growth rate converges to our projected 2.3 percent rate of potential GDP growth.\xc2\xa0 This matches the latest long-run forecast by the Blue Chip panel, and is generally in line with CBO\xe2\x80\x99s recent estimate of 2.2 percent per year for potential.\xc2\xa0 We also project that inflation will remain low, the unemployment rate will continue to edge down, and interest rates will rise as the economy continues its expansion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to note that the forecast was finalized in November in order to give agencies time to prepare their budget estimates.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, we learned that the economy grew 2.4 percent in 2014, above the 2.2 percent rate that was assumed in November and appears in the budget.</p>\n<p>Moreover, both inflation and interest rates are also somewhat lower than we had forecast in November.\xc2\xa0 We will, of course, have updated economic and budget projections in the mid-session review that would incorporate all of this information.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And with that, let me turn it over to Cecilia.</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much, Jason.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us, in talking about the budget in the weeks leading up to today, that the budget is an expression of the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for what he wants -- what he wants us to be, what he wants our economy to look like in the 21st century, and how we will continue to lead the world economically.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The supports for working families that you see in this budget, in particular, are an expression of the vision of both what helps us economically, as well as what supports the middle class and, in particular, supports and creates a good start for our youngest Americans.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m going to focus in a little bit in particular on the series of proposals around children and child care, because this budget presents the most comprehensive to date approach for early childhood education for children in this country, from birth until they enter kindergarten.\xc2\xa0 And the hope here is that one of the many results of the policies that the President has put forward is more children entering kindergarten ready to learn.</p>\n<p>So this budget sets a historic goal of helping every family with children under five find a place for their child to learn and grow while parents work.\xc2\xa0 So the biggest elements of this plan include tripling the child care tax credit for middle-class families to up to $3,000 for families with young children, offering child care subsidies to low-income working families to serve an additional one million children a month by 2025, while also working to strengthen the quality of child care programs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the President is repeating his Preschool For All program.\xc2\xa0 This is the proposal to provide pre-K -- high-quality pre-K to every four-year-old in this country.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s also an expansion of the Head Start proposed in this budget, in particular to make sure that Head Start can be offered for a full day throughout a full year, which is not currently the case for many Head Start programs.</p>\n<p>So the combination of these proposals is essentially a comprehensive approach to early childhood development in a way which supports children and also supports working families.</p>\n<p>There are other important investments in this budget in the K-12 system, as well as in higher education.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve obviously heard about the proposal to make community college free.\xc2\xa0 We continue our commitment to Pell grants and other supports for families in higher ed.\xc2\xa0 And there are important investments here in the Title I program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, an important $3 billion investment towards the goal of making sure teachers are full prepared and fully supported throughout their careers.\xc2\xa0 And then a $1.2 billion investment towards creating better schools through re-designing high schools, through school improvement grants and investments in charter schools.</p>\n<p>So altogether, what we see is an approach that\'s really focused on, again, making sure that working families have the supports they need, particularly families with youngest children, but also making sure that we are investing in the full spectrum of the educational system from birth really through what we think of now as grade 14, by making community college as accessible in the future as high school has become for Americans today.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d just spend one minute on what is really a core component of middle-class economics, and that\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan on infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Infrastructure is critical to creating good middle-class jobs, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also critical to our long-term competitiveness in a global economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have an over-$1-trillion deficit in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 All of us feel it every day.\xc2\xa0 Workers trying to get to work stuck in traffic.\xc2\xa0 Businesses trying to get products overseas in an efficient manner to export and support good-paying jobs.\xc2\xa0 Infrastructure is critical to all of this, and we\'re not where we need to be.</p>\n<p>The President goes very big on infrastructure in the budget to repair roads, bridges, freight, and our rail systems.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a long-term plan, so it\xe2\x80\x99s six years -- up from four years last year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been solving infrastructure in few-month patches.\xc2\xa0 That is no way to plan infrastructure projects.\xc2\xa0 So this is a six-year proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s $480 billion, which allows us to fund at about 40 percent above the current level of spend.\xc2\xa0 And there are many high-return investments for that $480 billion.\xc2\xa0 Importantly, it\xe2\x80\x99s fully paid for through business tax reform -- specifically the one-time money that\'s overseas, bringing that money back and raising taxes on that money to pay for the plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the bottom line is infrastructure is traditionally a bipartisan issue.\xc2\xa0 Everyone agrees our infrastructure is outdated; it needs to be modernized.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a twofer in that it supports good-paying jobs -- good-paying, middle-class jobs -- right away.\xc2\xa0 And at the same time, it sets us up for long-term competitiveness in this global marketplace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hand it back to Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the top lines, guys.\xc2\xa0 So with that, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to questions.\xc2\xa0 Who wants to be first?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mr. Kuhnhenn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I wanted to follow up on the infrastructure and corporate tax reform component.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that without a full corporate tax reform, you can still do a one-off on the 14 percent on accumulated foreign earnings?\xc2\xa0 Or does that -- can only that occur in the context of a broader corporate tax overhaul?\xc2\xa0 And also, yesterday, Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan said that corporate tax reform has to occur in the context of small business tax reform as well, which would mean somehow dealing with individual income tax reform.\xc2\xa0 So do you see those as inevitably --</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We do believe in comprehensive business tax reform, which involves lowering the domestic rate, the statutory rate, which is at 35 percent -- which is the highest in the world -- to 28 percent, 25 percent for manufacturing; setting up an international system that is a hybrid system where you have a minimum tax of 19 percent, and then bringing back the money that\xe2\x80\x99s overseas at this 14 percent that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 That is very different than a repatriation holiday, which we believe is bad policy.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99re right that many businesses are small businesses, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan does a lot for small businesses.\xc2\xa0 It simplifies how small businesses file their taxes so they can use cash accounting, which is basically their bank statement rather than very complex accrual accounting.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s available for all businesses up to $25 million.\xc2\xa0 It also enables businesses to write off investments in their first year of up to a million dollars.\xc2\xa0 That will really help simplify small business filings and lower rates for many small businesses.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we believe in doing business tax reform across the board, while at the same time making sure that we do things that are good for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned in my opening, investing in infrastructure is good for the middle class, so that\xe2\x80\x99s an important component of any tax reform that we do -- making sure that we are benefitting the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 14 cannot occur absent broader --</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 It is not a one-off proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of a more comprehensive approach to fix what is clearly a broken business tax system.\xc2\xa0 And at the same time, we want to make sure that as we\xe2\x80\x99re addressing business tax reform, that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing things that are good for the middle class.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know that, Josh, you described this as kind of the open -- I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve described this as kind of the opening of a negotiation, and I was interested in something that the President said while he was unveiling it today.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to accept a budget that locks in sequestration going forward,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to \xe2\x80\x9caccept a budget that severs the vital link between [our] national security and [our] economic security.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, as you guys are entering a negotiation with Republicans in Congress, whether those are both kind of bright lines that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to insist on in any budget document that might actually pass.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re asking if there are additional ones beyond the ones that the President mentioned today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you veto, I guess, legislation that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include those two aspects?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we just put out our budget proposal today and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything from Republicans yet, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be -- I mean, Republicans have found it a virtue for some reason to declare a budget dead on arrival before having seen it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I want to put myself in the same position.\xc2\xa0 The President has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to consider good ideas from either side of the aisle wherever they -- from wherever they originate, particularly if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President identify at least those two areas as essentially deal-breakers for him, because continuing to leave the sequester in place does have a negative impact on our ability to support middle-class families, and it certainly has a negative impact on the ability of our men and women in the military to keep our country safe.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take my word for it; we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously seen just about every uniformed military leader who\xe2\x80\x99s spoken on this issue has raised the same concern.</p>\n<p>So the kind of concerns -- the good news in all of this, I think, is that the concerns that the President has raised along these lines are consistent with concerns that at least some Republicans on Capitol Hill have raised as well.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are Republicans who are concerned about the sequester, both in terms of the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s having on the economy and the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s having on national security, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So despite the President being pretty declarative about those two elements, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that necessarily is going to rule out or make it that much more difficult for us to be able to try to find common ground on some common-sense budgeting proposals that are in the best interest of our national security and the best interest of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Josh, just from a fiscal perspective, I also think that there is growing bipartisan recognition that discretionary spending is not the important issue from a fiscal perspective.\xc2\xa0 In fact, our discretionary spending is at near its lowest level as a share of our economy as it\'s ever been.\xc2\xa0 And I also think it\'s important to remember that national security is dependent on more than just the Department of Defense budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In fact, in the non-defense category is all of the commitments we\'ve made to our veterans.\xc2\xa0 It includes the Homeland Security budget, which obviously is a critical part of protecting our country.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why it\'s critical that we get a bill done, a full year bill for 2015 right now.</p>\n<p>So I think we have to see this, in addition to the investments that Jeff and Cecilia have talked about, as this connection between the defense and the non-defense part of the budget.\xc2\xa0 You really can\'t -- that\'s what the President said today -- you cannot break that link.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to this side.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Donovan, you said the budget would be good for Social Security.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a chance to read the budget this morning.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us exactly how this budget would strengthen the Social Security system?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, broadly speaking, the long-term deficit is significantly helped by this budget.\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear -- and CBO put out these numbers last week -- under current law, we would see both deficits grow above 4 percent of GDP and the debt grow over 80 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 What this budget does is to reverse that course.\xc2\xa0 It keeps deficits under 3 percent of GDP every year of the budget window.\xc2\xa0 And, critically, it starts to bend that curve on debt, so it stabilizes and then begins to reduce debt as a share of GDP.</p>\n<p>Specifically, on Social Security Trust Fund, one of the fundamental problems we\'re facing is that the number of workers that we have relative to the number of retirees that are supported by Social Security has been shrinking.\xc2\xa0 And so comprehensive immigration reform is actually one of the most critical things that we can do to shore up the long-term solvency of Social Security, and as a result, to improve our deficit challenges in the long run.</p>\n<p>And in fact, you might have seen last week that just from the executive actions that the President took late last year, there is a positive impact on the Social Security Trust Fund because of additional payments that come into that.\xc2\xa0 And so comprehensive immigration reform on a much larger scale would improve that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>CBO\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are that comprehensive immigration reform -- and that\'s what we reflect in our budget -- in the first decade is about $160 billion of deficit reduction; in the second decade, it\'s almost $700 billion of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 So it grows over time as more workers come into the country, pay taxes, and pay into the Social Security Trust Fund.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in this budget that specifically discourages tax inversions, first?\xc2\xa0 Secondly, if you are serious about finding common ground with Republicans, why not include a plan in this budget for entitlement reform?\xc2\xa0 I know that that was a big part of the 2011 budget discussions.\xc2\xa0 And then I just want to get your thoughts on the sequester.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about the fact all day that the deficit has been reduced by two-thirds, you said.\xc2\xa0 So did the sequester ultimately work?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jason, do you want to do inversions first?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m also happy to start on the entitlement part, too.</p>\n<p>In terms of inversions, the budget repeats a proposal the President had made last year and actively called on Congress to pass that would set the threshold that you have -- as long as you\'re majority-owned by your historical U.S. shareholders, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be treated for tax purposes as a U.S. company.\xc2\xa0 So it would take away the ability to find a smaller foreign company, acquire them, and shift over to them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The entire business tax reform agenda, though, is also about making it more attractive to invest in America and to close a number of the other loopholes that companies use that complement what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done on inversions.\xc2\xa0 So all of this, as the Secretary said when he announced what he was doing administratively on inversions, that helped, but it couldn\'t do as much as what you could do legislatively.\xc2\xa0 So that proposal repeats itself here.</p>\n<p>Just to take the first crack at entitlements, and then others could build on it.\xc2\xa0 This is a budget that does include $400 billion of savings from reforming our health system.\xc2\xa0 Those reforms to our health system are very much in the spirit of what we\'ve done to date, which is about how to make the health system more effective and efficient.\xc2\xa0 When you do that, it brings down costs, it saves money for the budget, it saves money for seniors, and it slows the cost growth in health care.</p>\n<p>That\'s part of an overall fiscal approach, though, that includes reforming the tax system and reforming the immigration system.\xc2\xa0 So it follows in the same path that the President has in previous budgets of balanced deficit reduction coming from the spending side, coming from the revenue side, and sufficient to get the debt on a declining share of the economy, which is what economists would think is important.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Shaun, do you want to add to that?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Just two quick points I would make.\xc2\xa0 One, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of focus, rightly so, on our short-run deficits and how much they\xe2\x80\x99ve come down.\xc2\xa0 This has been the fastest period of sustained deficit reduction since after World War II.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve also seen substantial improvements in our long-run deficits.\xc2\xa0 And the single biggest driver of that has been the slower growth in health care costs.</p>\n<p>Just to take one example, if you look at CBO\xe2\x80\x99s numbers, our spending on Medicare and Medicaid in the year 2020 is now expected to be almost $200 billion lower, just in that one year, than it was when the President came into office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what Jason is talking about on entitlement reform is incredibly important, but building on that as well, we have a new proposal in the budget this year which would adopt bipartisan legislation on what\xe2\x80\x99s called the doc fix, or SGR.\xc2\xa0 We would adopt that, paid for, because everything in the budget is fully paid for, and we would add some additional reforms to that legislation that build on what Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of HHS, has done on delivery system reform.\xc2\xa0 So if we can keep driving those costs lower, even more important than Social Security or other entitlement issues, this issue of health care cost is the single most important place where we can really bend the cost curve in the long run on entitlement savings.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of the sequester and whether or not it worked.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say, first of all, if you just look at the deficit reduction to date, more of it this past year was because of the tax deal that restored the Clinton-era rates on high-income households and the Affordable Care Act, the combination of those, than from the sequester.</p>\n<p>Second of all, the most important test of your fiscal policy, as Shaun says, is where you are over the medium or long run.\xc2\xa0 And there, those steps dwarf the impact of the sequester in terms of changing our medium- and long-run debt and deficit trajectory.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Off-mic.)</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 We have detailed charts in the budget that we could provide to you that show precisely what role it\xe2\x80\x99s played.\xc2\xa0 But, again, to Jason\xe2\x80\x99s point, it\xe2\x80\x99s dwarfed in the long run by these other \xe2\x80\x93- and also, the fundamental point that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to where our challenges are in the long term on the fiscal side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Discretionary spending, once again, it\xe2\x80\x99s at a very low level relative to GDP.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, over our budget window, it continues to grow smaller as a share of GDP because it is not growing as fast as GDP.\xc2\xa0 So it is not the fiscal challenge that we focus on.\xc2\xa0 If anything, the reverse; if we want to grow our economy, we need to make the investments that Jeff and Cecilia have talked about.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you choose the 14 percent level for the tax on bringing back overseas profits?\xc2\xa0 And would there be any limits on what companies could do with those repatriated funds?\xc2\xa0 And do you have forecasts for the impact on the economy if a considerable amount of company brought back those funds?</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 That rate of 14 percent is about 40 percent of the 35 percent.\xc2\xa0 Importantly, it will be on all dollars overseas.\xc2\xa0 So this is not voluntary; it\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory.\xc2\xa0 And the dollars would come back to the U.S. hopefully to be invested in good U.S. jobs and manufacturing facilities, but there would not be a specific requirement on those dollars.\xc2\xa0 The requirement is that they all pay 14 percent.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This side of the room.\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a couple questions.\xc2\xa0 First, the debt.\xc2\xa0 For all the high-fiving and balloon-releasing about the deficit, which is impressive, the debt is a ticking time bomb.\xc2\xa0 How aggressive is your policy toward reducing the debt?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So as I said earlier, on our current course, debt would grow as a share of the economy from about 75 percent now to about 81 percent by 2025.\xc2\xa0 What we do in our budget is bring that down substantially so that debt as a share of the economy shrinks from about 75 percent of GDP down to 73 percent of GDP by the end of the window, so by 2025.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think perhaps even more importantly, the key things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, unlike sequestration, the key things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing for our long-term fiscal future grow in importance as you get beyond 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So the tax changes that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, for example, on capital gains, they\xe2\x80\x99re structured so that the scale of revenues they bring in grows over time.\xc2\xa0 Immigration reform is something where the impact would grow substantially over time.\xc2\xa0 And many of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about before on health care costs, delivery system reform and others, the benefits would compound over time as you bring the growth in health care costs down below the growth of GDP.\xc2\xa0 So all of those are the most important things that you can do in the long run to bring down our debt.</p>\n<p>At the same time, what we should recognize is that we owe a debt to our seniors who have paid into Social Security and other benefits.\xc2\xa0 What we can\xe2\x80\x99t do is make reforms that break that promise to them, and recognize that we have a demographic bubble that we are dealing with through roughly the mid-2030s.\xc2\xa0 And if we can get through that period with debt stabilized and on a declining path as our budget does, we put the nation in a much better position as the number of workers grows, particularly if we can pass immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a very quick follow.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask about military spending in general.\xc2\xa0 Fighting the wars on terror and everything that is still happening -- it is very real.\xc2\xa0 Does this budget address, in your estimation, everything that needs to be addressed, or is there more that you can do to make sure that the American people are safe?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we have to recognize that the country has made real progress.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about in the State of the Union address that when he came into office, that we had 180,000 troops overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re down now to 15,000 and on a downward trajectory there.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve had real benefits in terms of the lives of our brave service people who are serving overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are real fiscal benefits from that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re spending $130 billion less this year just on emergency military costs than we were when the President came into office.\xc2\xa0 And because of his stewardship of our national security, those costs continue to decline by another more than $10 billion in our budget proposal.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the budget recognizes that in our base investments, in the DOD budget, not our emergency costs but our base budget, there are places where we need to invest.\xc2\xa0 And that means investing in our service people.\xc2\xa0 It means investing in making sure our technology stays ahead of other countries, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in space or other research and development.</p>\n<p>So there are a number of places where we recognize it, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see a $37 billion increase in 2016 for the defense budget that really focuses on where those needs are and keeping Americans safe.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And, Cecilia, I wanted to ask you, if I could, about the $1 billion being sent to Central American countries to address the issue that happened last summer with the immigrants coming across the border.\xc2\xa0 When there, the biggest problem that people who are not in the government talk about is government corruption.\xc2\xa0 What is the United States going to do to protect that billion dollars to make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear and land up in Swiss bank accounts, and instead actually helps the people there?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll tackle this a little bit, but with the reminder that I\xe2\x80\x99m the Domestic Policy Advisor so I will also turn to my colleagues.</p>\n<p>The focus of the resources going to Central America is really both to improve safety as well as development.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Vice President talk about it, he talks in very strong terms and makes a comparison to what we did in Colombia, which required enormous investment of resources as well as political capital by the Colombians in partnership with the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re talking about building the same kind of partnership with the Central American countries to make sure that they\'re advancing economically, but that they\'re also making the advances that are needed with respect to safety and security.</p>\n<p>You\'ll recall that the reason for -- one of the stated reasons for the crisis in the arrival of unaccompanied minors that we saw last summer had to do with folks\xe2\x80\x99 fear, in particular fear of violence affecting young people.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re dedicating resources to a panoply of things with a goal being that the United States be a good partner to these societies and help strengthen them so that they\'re able to deal with these problems in country rather than confront the kind of crisis that we had here.</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a broader illustration of the notion that we have to approach these issues as a hemisphere, and that the United States has to be thinking about this and thinking about situations like the situation we experienced last summer.\xc2\xa0 From a much broader perspective, that was not just a migration situation; it was a migration situation which resulted from a much larger phenomenon that we have a role to play in making sure that we mitigate.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So just to add a little bit on Cecilia\xe2\x80\x99s point, Plan Colombia has been remarkably successful in going at exactly the same issues that you talked about.\xc2\xa0 And so as a piece, as a Cecilia talked about this comprehensive approach, a specific piece of the funding that we would dedicate is on governance reforms and would be directly targeted at making sure that you build the government institutions and also attack the kind of graft and corruption that you\'re talking about.</p>\n<p>The other thing I would just mention on this:\xc2\xa0 This is something that the President and the Vice President really have been focusing on for some time.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken a number of steps where the three countries in particular that we\'re focused on have already agreed to a number of things to strengthen, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the rule of law or to stop corruption within their systems.\xc2\xa0 And we can get you more specifics on those, but there are steps that have already been committed in advance of us making this commitment.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also important to recognize that this is one of many opportunities that the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts on Cuba have begun to open up in the hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 We have a moment of opportunity to move forward together with countries across the hemisphere so that we\'re much more likely now, as Cecilia said, to get other countries investing -- the source, the three countries themselves -- but other countries, as well, that would support our efforts.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On this side.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see.\xc2\xa0 Lalit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some more details about your Asia Pacific rebalance?\xc2\xa0 And is the increased budget allocation for cybersecurity, is it driven by the threats being posed by China and Russia?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, just to make sure, you said on the Asia Pacific rebalance?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 I think what probably would be best, given that we don\'t have a national security staff here, is if maybe if we could follow up with you specifically.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of places where we are increasing investments to focus on the Asia Pacific rebalance.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we have the expertise, the right expertise here to get into detail on those.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, Lalit, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody follow up with you, okay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cybersecurity?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 Shaun, can you take that?\xc2\xa0 Or, Jeff?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 We do have a range of investments around cybersecurity, well over $10 billion of investment that is going toward cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 That includes both research and development, investments that are part of a broader significant expansion of R&amp;D, as well as specific investments at the Department of Homeland Security; at OMB actually, which is responsible for setting policy in many of these areas; and also in our national security agencies, more broadly.\xc2\xa0 So it is a specific area, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see called out in the budget presentation today, many more details on exactly where those are focused.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind folks that the President has sent to the Hill legislation on data breach and on information sharing, and encourages those pieces of legislation to move forward as fast as possible in bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 The President also will be hosting a summit on cybersecurity on the West Coast at Stanford University on the 13th of this month, so in 10 days or so.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was actually referring to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, a number of these proposals have been in this budget for quite some time -- closing the carried interest loophole, the Buffett Rule.\xc2\xa0 They were not passed by a Congress that had Democratic control in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 What can you do in the coming year to bring Republicans to the table?\xc2\xa0 And what makes you think that these plans actually have life this year with the new Republican Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the first crack at this, and Shaun may have some other ideas on this too.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the first thing that comes to mind, Jonathan, is just that the fact that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass the first time doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re not good ideas.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that they\xe2\x80\x99re included in the budget once again is because they are good ideas, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to advocate to members of Congress in both parties that they should consider them and actually include them in legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing is, we also would acknowledge that this is going to be a compromise; that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Republicans who are in charge of the Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Democrat who\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in the White House.\xc2\xa0 So anything that emerges from these proposals and discussions about the budget will require an effort to try to find some common ground.\xc2\xa0 And maybe there will be an opportunity to include some things in this budget that Republicans haven\xe2\x80\x99t previously supported, in exchange for some things -- some new ideas that they may have.</p>\n<p>The third thing is -- and this is, I think, a good segue to Shaun -- is that there are a pretty substantial number of things that are included in this budget that have been previously supported by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is a good indication that by focusing on what we think the core goals should be, in terms of protecting the country and investing in middle-class families, that there should be some reasonable common ground that we can find.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President so strongly advocates ensuring that we not allow a disagreement over one issue, like immigration, to become a deal-breaker over all the others.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of important things that we can do where there does appear to be some common ground.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not suggesting that this is easy, or that anybody here thinks it\'s going to be easy, but there certainly is an opportunity that\xe2\x80\x99s worth pursuing.\xc2\xa0 Shaun, do you want to just do two or three of sort of some of the best ideas that are included in this budget that have previously been supported by Republicans?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Sure, and Jeff may have some thoughts on this as well, given his focus on tax policy.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of things -- the financial fee is a good example, but also the linkage between international tax reform and infrastructure, which were included in the Camp plan.\xc2\xa0 And many of the proposals -- whether it\'s around child care or a number of the other things that Cecilia focused on, free community college -- have been ideas that not only have had Republican support in the past, but actually legislative proposals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there\xe2\x80\x99s been support for every one of the ideas -- I think Josh is exactly right.\xc2\xa0 But we will see I think a significant opportunity to get some of these -- to advance some of these ideas going forward.</p>\n<p>The other thing I would just point out, which I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got lots of good examples from the budget last year, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on minimum wage or others -- it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about what the federal government does, it\xe2\x80\x99s also about what mayors and governors and other local officials do.\xc2\xa0 And I think there is a real opportunity in many of these ideas to build momentum and support in a way that Congress may not lead on them but they may end up following because of work that happens in other parts of the country.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I would just add that, yes, I think there is, at a strategic level, real alignment.\xc2\xa0 I used the example that we talked about some of infrastructure and tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Everybody agrees that we have to fix our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Everybody agrees that the current tax system doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, that our statutory rate at 35 percent is the highest in the world, that our international system is dysfunctional.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then everybody agrees a top line -- not everyone, but both Republican leaders and some Democratic leaders, including the President, most importantly, agree on the basic framework for the approach.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in the detail, but the strategic alignment is real and significant.\xc2\xa0 And then you can be more granular and look at something like expanding the EITC, the childless EITC, which both the President proposes in his budget and Paul Ryan proposes.</p>\n<p>So I think you have strategic alignment in some very important areas, and then you have specific alignment around proposals that both Republican leadership and the President agree upon.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we can get some of this stuff done.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Over here.\xc2\xa0 Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Cecilia, on the 529 plan, tuition plan, how safe is that?\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that could be rolled back and we would lose our investment?</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already said -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve already essentially backed away from the original 529 proposal.\xc2\xa0 It was also a very, very small part of the restructuring of the various offerings with respect to savings for a college education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the point here is that this administration continues to be committed to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re making resources available to make college more affordable.\xc2\xa0 So the budget includes things like making sure that Pell grants are permanently protected from inflation.\xc2\xa0 We have the community college proposal.\xc2\xa0 But we also have a consolidation of the various tax credits and other sort of structures that exist now.\xc2\xa0 And the idea being that we learned that a significant number of folks who participate in one program ended up not participating in the one that would have benefitted them more because there are so many different options and it can be confusing.</p>\n<p>So the goal here is to consolidate in such a way that more middle-class families, and families working to get to the middle class, get the support that they need to pay for college and to repay student loans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Off-mic.)</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The administration has no plans or proposals in the 529 space.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Just to put a -- as the budget wonk here, to put a number on this -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re proposing in the budget is a nearly $50 billion-dollar increase in tax benefits toward paying for college.\xc2\xa0 And so, on a net basis, what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal dramatically improves college affordability through the tax system compared to what we currently have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 John.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One for Josh, one I think for Jason.\xc2\xa0 Josh, what do you think the effect of this budget will be for Democrats heading into the 2016 election, both at the presidential level and at the congressional level?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in here they\'re not going to like?\xc2\xa0 And then for Jason, on carried interest, which Jonathan mentioned a moment ago, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that that loophole could be closed without congressional action with the reinterpretation at the Treasury or IRS level.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why not just close it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As it relates to the 2016 question, I will confess this is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of thought about the budget in that context.\xc2\xa0 My suspicion is that everybody who looks at this will think that there is at least one element in the hundreds of pages that they\xe2\x80\x99re presented with, or they\xe2\x80\x99ll think to themselves, gee, I might have done it a little bit differently.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that\xe2\x80\x99s true of the vast majority of Democrats, both those who are in office and those who are contemplating running for a different one.</p>\n<p>But, at the same time, I also think that what is codified in the series of volumes that were presented today is a pretty cogent vision for how to move the country forward and how to grow our economy from the middle out; that by focusing on middle-class economics, we can build the kind of country that is in the best interest of middle-class families but also is in the best interest of the longer-term stability of our country.\xc2\xa0 That there is an opportunity for us to use this new foundation that we have laid, after recovering from the crisis over the last six years, to really build this country in the direction of making it more fair and more free, and creating more opportunity for everybody who lives here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that really is the core of the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision and I think that reflects a vision that I think the vast majority of Democrats out there can agree with.</p>\n<p>The truth is, I think that there are a lot of reasons that Republicans can find to agree with that as well.\xc2\xa0 The question is, will they put politics aside and actually try to work to try to find common ground with this administration to do that, or will they not -- which has been consistent with their pattern in the last six years.\xc2\xa0 But hope does spring eternal around here.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 In answer to your second question, Treasury and the IRS are responsible for administering the tax system, so you should ask them that question in terms of specific regulations.\xc2\xa0 In terms of our budget proposal, we\xe2\x80\x99re asking Congress to change the law so that income that is essentially like any other form of income, but earned in certain activities, gets taxed as such.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a common-sense idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President wants carried interest to be taxed as ordinary income, which is in this budget and has been in past budgets, and his Treasury Department and IRS are able to make policy to do that.\xc2\xa0 I guess the question is, why not just do it?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think you should ask Treasury and IRS what their authorities and plans are in this area, because this is \xe2\x80\x93- they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for implementing the tax laws that Congress passes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, this gentleman right here in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Steve Stromberg with the Washington Post Editorial Board.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hi, Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Instead of relying on corporate repatriation to fund infrastructure, why not just raise the gas tax?</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The President has not proposed and has no plans to propose an increase in the gas tax.\xc2\xa0 The plan that we\xe2\x80\x99ve described here -- using dollars from overseas, bringing them back to the U.S., and raising money in order to fund a long-term, six-year reauthorization at a level that\xe2\x80\x99s close to 40 percent higher than current spend -- we think is the right plan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of traction.\xc2\xa0 That said, the President is open to other proposals and would consider other proposals that Congress contemplates.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick two-part.\xc2\xa0 Cecilia, I was interested in what the pay-for is for the two free years of community college, if you might.\xc2\xa0 And also, Jeff, just kind of following up on that question, how real is this infrastructure plan?\xc2\xa0 And aren\xe2\x80\x99t you, in effect, raising taxes on American businesses, which seems to be a non-starter with this Republican Congress?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, expecting them to believe that once you raise taxes once, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a one-year only and it won\xe2\x80\x99t become a permanent thing.</p>\n<p>MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll start.\xc2\xa0 The revenue raisers that we\xe2\x80\x99ve described in the course of the tax reforms that we laid out a couple weeks ago are more than enough to cover the community college program as well as the other elements of the budget that I described.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, repeat the first part of your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the first part is, so you\xe2\x80\x99re (inaudible) this infrastructure -- bringing the money back from American corporations.\xc2\xa0 How real is it to expect this Congress to basically raise taxes on American businesses or ask them to pay a tax they\xe2\x80\x99re not paying now?\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, to believe that this is a one-time only tax?</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of, as I mentioned earlier, a comprehensive approach to business tax reform.\xc2\xa0 And a very important component of that is to make sure that this is also good for middle-class families, infrastructure investment being central to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The long-term plan here is revenue neutrality, so no additional money from corporate or business taxes.\xc2\xa0 That said, there is this one-time opportunity, because of the $2 trillion that are overseas, that would be taxed here at a much lower rate -- 14 percent -- and that raises the money to do the six-year reauthorization at a much higher level than our current spend.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s long-term revenue neutral, but this one-time opportunity to tax the $2 trillion, which has not been taxed, which is overseas, at 14 percent.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Could I just add one thing to that?\xc2\xa0 Because I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some confusion about the relationship between this proposal and something that would be completely different and, in many ways, the opposite of this proposal, which is a repatriation holiday.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the course of explaining that difference, it also helps answer your question.</p>\n<p>The proposal the President is making would be mandatory on all overseas earnings as opposed to an election that could be made.\xc2\xa0 As a result, it raises money -- $270 billion over 10 years -- as opposed to a repatriation holiday would lose money.\xc2\xa0 And then the third that I think gets at your question, this is part of a plan to reform the tax system.\xc2\xa0 So on a going-forward basis, you would have a 19 percent minimum tax on all the earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations.\xc2\xa0 And because it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a plan that deals with the earnings that have been incurred in the past and the earnings in the future, it becomes a stable system as opposed to a one-time measure that then raises a question about how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with it again in the future.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And just on the politics of this, the other thing that occurs to me is that when the President was running for this office in 2007 and 2008, he was strongly advocating raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans -\xe2\x80\x93 something that Republicans said was dead on arrival, that they would never approve of.\xc2\xa0 But in 2012, shortly after he was reelected, and which he campaigned on this issue again, he did actually succeed in getting a Republican majority in the House of Representatives to eventually vote for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 So the point is, just because they\xe2\x80\x99re against it now doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99ll be against it in the end.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, and to that end, the framework, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned a couple times, that the President has, of lowering the statutory rate, creating this minimum tax that Jason just described and bringing the money back from overseas with the one-time toll charge, using that money for infrastructure -- all four components are the same as Chairman Camp\xe2\x80\x99s plan from last year, the Republican House Ways and Means plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three quick items.\xc2\xa0 How do you achieve your mandatory savings that you\xe2\x80\x99re projecting over 10 years?\xc2\xa0 What is the baseline VA number for this year, and how do you project VA spending to have to increase going forward?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s your disposition of overseas contingency operations funding?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So on the mandatory side, we discussed a little bit earlier there\xe2\x80\x99s about $400 billion in savings on Medicare and Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 In addition to that -- so those are not the only mandatory savings in the budget, so I want to be clear.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s program integrity savings that we would achieve, for example, at IRS.\xc2\xa0 Because we\'re under-investing in IRS capacity, we\'re actually losing out on tax collections to the tune of tens of billions of dollars.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s about $60 billion of mandatory savings we\xe2\x80\x99d get if we invested more in collection and enforcement at IRS.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one example.</p>\n<p>Crop insurance is another area where we think we can improve the system, encourage farmers to actually be planting more, lower the excess profits of insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s are a range of other -- my point is there are a range of other mandatory savers in this, not just on the health side.</p>\n<p>But on the health side, there are a range of them.\xc2\xa0 Jason has I think pretty great expertise here that include reforms on the provider side that accelerate the kind of savings measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in areas where we think there are not current incentives to save.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s things like home health care aids and a range of other ways that we -- the payment arrangements we have with providers.\xc2\xa0 There are also some -- about 20 percent of the savings, which focus on ensuring that particularly the highest income beneficiaries are paying their fair share.</p>\n<p>And there are also then things like controlling drug costs; other things that right now are leading to -- even though health care costs are growing much more slowly than they have historically, we still have areas where costs are growing quickly, like particularly some of these designer, new prescription drugs that we think could be brought under the umbrella of cost-saving proposals that have worked in other areas of Medicare and Medicaid.</p>\n<p>How did I do, Jason?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I thought that was fine.\xc2\xa0 If you have your budget, pages 105 to 119 have 15 pages with dozens and dozens and dozens of mandatory proposals that, on net, save money -- of which Shaun hit the highlights.\xc2\xa0 I thought you had two others.\xc2\xa0 But they seem like numbers we could get you afterwards.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 VA and OCO.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So OCO, I mentioned earlier, is down about $130 billion since the President came into office.\xc2\xa0 It declines another $11 billion under our proposal.\xc2\xa0 And on VA, I don\'t have the precise number in front of me, but it is a substantial increase for veterans health care, I think in the range of 7 percent.\xc2\xa0 But let me get you a specific number.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major, we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Lesley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned that you said that you had -- first time you had thought about the budget in a 2016 context.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a little bit about that, because isn\xe2\x80\x99t this something that you\'re hoping that Democrats will seize this sort of mission of helping the middle class?\xc2\xa0 And also if I could ask Mr. Donovan to expand a little bit on the idea why you targeted crop insurance and the savings from that -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s not playing well in Kansas.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 To allude to a famous book.\xc2\xa0 In terms of 2016, one reason is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a fiscal year 2017 budget that will be out in early 2016 too.\xc2\xa0 So I guess that would be one reason.\xc2\xa0 The second reason is, we certainly do hope that Democrats and Republicans will seize on the ideas that are included in this budget, but not for political end, but to actually get something done in Congress that would benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what our aim is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why maybe I should have thought about it more in a 2016 context, but hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, because our principal goals here are around bipartisanship and around actually trying to get action on Capitol Hill on this and not just a talking point.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So maybe to go back to Josh\xe2\x80\x99s earlier point, if you look at the broad scope of proposals that we have in the budget and recognize the fact that we have roughly 100 different cuts, consolidations, reforms, two significant programs, I\'m sure that there will be places in the country and, as Josh said, things that Democrats and Republicans alike will find that they may not totally agree with.\xc2\xa0 But we have in past years proposed reforms to crop insurance, as well.</p>\n<p>Specifically here what you find is there are places where, for example, by the way that we structure these insurance programs, we actually encourage farmers not to plant on their land, for example.\xc2\xa0 We also have other places where we encourage or we subsidize farmers in farming techniques that actually are less sustainable for the land that they\xe2\x80\x99re working.\xc2\xa0 And so we think that these are smart reforms that both maintain the basic protection of farmers for real emergencies that happen, but don\xe2\x80\x99t actually encourage them not to plant when they could, or encourage them to follow practices that are actually not good for the very land that they depend on.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the debt again.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that there are some mandatory savings in this that would help with the sustainability of Social Security and Medicare in the long run.\xc2\xa0 But you started out by saying that now with economic growth, and things starting to move again, this budget was an opportunity for the President to really say what he thought should happen.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder why a lot of people are saying this is a missed opportunity.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose to -- rather than shave a little bit off a very fast growth -- projected growth of entitlements over the next decade, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose to really tackle them.\xc2\xa0 Is it just too politically difficult to do that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Let me just, I guess, disagree with the fundamental premise.\xc2\xa0 When the President came into office, he recognized what I think a broad group on a bipartisan basis recognize is the single most important contributor to the long-run growth in the cost of our entitlements, which was the spiraling cost of health care.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved since he came into office, in part because of the recession we inherited, but also because of structural reforms in our system, have now substantially lowered the long-term cost of entitlements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to the point I made.\xc2\xa0 Just in the year 2020, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about almost $200 billion of savings in Medicare and Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the projections in the budget this year long run, you see substantially lower costs far out into the future for these programs than we had when the President came into office.</p>\n<p>And the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re adopting not just the $400 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings that we discussed in the budget, we\xe2\x80\x99re also adopting a bipartisan proposal on the doc fix, on SGR reform, which incorporates additional delivery system reforms that will lower the cost of health care in the future, and a range of other things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing beyond just the Medicare and Medicaid investments, on precision medicine, and a whole range of other areas.\xc2\xa0 I think we have a very strong argument that the President has been focused on since the beginning, on the key drivers of our long-term entitlements.\xc2\xa0 And he continues to be focused with some real momentum behind us in lower health care costs.</p>\n<p>I also think -- and this has been I think lost a little bit in the sort of political back and forth around immigration -- in addition to health care costs, the single most important thing that we can pay attention to is that we have a demographic imbalance in our country.\xc2\xa0 We have a growing number of retirees for the number of workers that we have in the country.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, immigration reform is fundamentally something that alters the balance on our entitlements in a way that very few other things do, because it grows the number of workers that we have per retiree.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the contributions to the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, on Medicare and Medicaid -- all of those are enormous out-year benefits that should not be ignored in this debate.</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add just a tiny bit economically.\xc2\xa0 In 2008, in the transition with Larry Summers, Tim Geithner, Christy Romer, Peter Orszag, the whole original economic team was trying to figure out what the right fiscal goal was going to be.\xc2\xa0 And economically, the decision was the right fiscal goal was to make sure the debt was falling as a share of the economy, which would require the deficit being below about 3 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a goal we achieved in 2014.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a goal we need to take additional steps on taxes, on health care and on immigration in order to make sure we continue to meet that goal over the next decade and beyond.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\'s very consistent with what economics would tell you you need to do to be in a sustainable and strong position to grow economically.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add to that, that the 3 percent target was also the one advocated by the minor deities that served on the Simpson-Bowles Commission.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out that while that certainly included the wisdom of the Obama economic team -- (laughter) -- it also included the stamp of approval from that bipartisan commission.</p>\n<p>Two other points I think that are also relevant to this.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the President has also been clear about the fact that his approach to dealing with our debt and deficit is that we\'re not going to ask the elderly and working families to bear the brunt of balancing our deficits and improving our fiscal situation; that there are a variety of steps that we can take that reflects a balanced approach, and that\'s one that the President is committed to.</p>\n<p>The last thing is that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sort of speak like an economist, so correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, that one of the most important things we can do to deal with our debts and deficits is to ensure we have a strong, dynamic, growing economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re not going to have a strong, dynamic growing economy if we\'re going to chip away at the kinds of investments that we know are critical to the success of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>So making the kinds of investments that we know are going to be good for a dynamic, growing economy are also going to be good for debt and deficit reduction down the line.</p>\n<p>Did I get that right?\xc2\xa0 Would I at least get a pass in the Furman economic coursework?</p>\n<p>MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 A-plus.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, good.\xc2\xa0 Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And forgive me if this was already asked and answered, but the budget proposes to cut the Veterans Choice Card program and take some of that money and move it elsewhere in the VA system.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that?\xc2\xa0 Is the Choice Card program not as needed as it was just last year?</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 So there is not a proposal to cut it.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a mischaracterization.\xc2\xa0 As we were looking at the projections for the VA going forward, recognize that this Choice program is a brand new program.\xc2\xa0 And for those not involved in the details, the Choice program was set up by legislation that gave certain veterans who either had been waiting a certain period of time or lived a geographic distance farther away from VA facilities the ability to get a Veterans Choice Card and seek medical care outside the VA system.\xc2\xa0 As we were putting together projections for the budget, you can imagine that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite uncertain how many veterans will ultimately exercise that choice and use that program.</p>\n<p>And so what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the budget is propose flexibility that would allow the VA to draw from some of the $10 billion that was set aside for that program if needed, if it is not fully utilized, and in case, for example, more veterans than we expect seek health care within the VA system.</p>\n<p>And so what we were trying to deal with is to give some flexibility in those resources to deal with some of the uncertainty that we have, given that this is a new program and we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure how many veterans would choose either to remain within the VA system or to seek health care using their Choice Cards.\xc2\xa0 And that was the idea.\xc2\xa0 It was not a cut in that sense.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This gentleman over here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the original point of this being a document from which negotiations can take place, on the matter of financing of infrastructure, is the mandatory requirement one of those potential negotiating points?\xc2\xa0 As you may know, there\'s a bipartisan bill that\xe2\x80\x99s coming together in Congress that may not include that aspect of it.</p>\n<p>MR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 As Jason said earlier, and he should feel free to add here, we are not supportive of a voluntary repatriation holiday.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy.\xc2\xa0 It costs a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 What the President is proposing is to reform what is a broken system and to fund infrastructure with the one-time revenue.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 Just to be specific about that, what the voluntary repatriation does is actually encourage profits to be held overseas going forward, and therefore it ends up being scored as costing a lot of money, as Jeff said, rather than actually saving money.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.\xc2\xa0 The President is getting ready to do his event over in the East Room.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 One for you, Josh, and one for Shaun.\xc2\xa0 Josh, since we have you here today, can you describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about arming Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 And, Shaun, for you, Republicans are very interested in an old idea, dynamic scoring.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you what kind of challenges that presents to the administration going forward as Republicans create their budget proposals and try to calculate the dynamic elements of features of their budget.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alexis, I think I read the same story that you did, which may be prompting your question.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of people who apparently, through one way or another, are making their views known on this policy area.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s view continues to be that this administration needs to be continually assessing what our strategy is to further isolate the Putin regime in Russia to convince them to reevaluate their strategy in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the strategy that we have implemented so far has succeeded in uniting the international community around this principle of respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries.\xc2\xa0 It has also succeeded in enforcing a sanctions regime against the Russian economy that has succeeded in devaluing their currency, causing many independent debt evaluators to downgrade the credit worthiness of Russian securities.\xc2\xa0 It has caused longer-term projections about their economy to be revised downward and into negative territory.\xc2\xa0 And so just about any measure that you consider, the Russian economy has taken a big hit because of the strategic decisions that President Putin has made as it relates to Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So that pressure is only continuing to intensify, and it has served to isolate them.\xc2\xa0 But it has not, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged, caused him at this point to live up to the kinds of diplomatic commitments that he\xe2\x80\x99s previously made to deescalate the situation in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So, for that reason, we\xe2\x80\x99re continually assessing what sort of options are available, but I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0 And there are, of course, a wide variety of opinions about this, but when we have anything to announce on this we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>DIRECTOR DONOVAN:\xc2\xa0 And just on dynamic scoring, to be clear, the current CBO practice, which we support, is to do a range of what we would call supplementary analyses.\xc2\xa0 And that includes using some of these dynamic models to look at what the potential range of effects could be on macroeconomic factors so that policymakers can understand and think about those.</p>\n<p>The fundamental problem of taking what are right now kind of speculative and broad-ranging analyses that are not used for budget scoring is that the range of uncertainty in doing these is vast, from the point of -- certain kinds of tax changes might actually grow the economy, they might actually shrink them.\xc2\xa0 And so the problem is -- and this has been the longtime practice of CBO directors for decades -- is highly speculative and uncertain kinds of effects like that, to take them in as score-able savings or costs on any significant bill really degrades the ability of policymakers to understand and to do accurate budgeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is not something that in the past has been partisan.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been agreement that looking at this information is helpful, but to actually use it for scoring is highly problematic in terms of being able to really get to precise understanding of what budgeting looks like going forward.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, for sitting through all of this.\xc2\xa0 If you have additional questions certainly folks in lower press and in the OMB press office will be available to answer your detailed questions.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:06 P.M EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
