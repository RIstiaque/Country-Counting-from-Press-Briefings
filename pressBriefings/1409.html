GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot left to say so I\xe2\x80\x99ll do a few of these and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get going.</p>\n<p>Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, let me follow up on that issue of bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 The President said more than once that it can\xe2\x80\x99t just be Democrats abandoning their ideas and accepting Republican ones; it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be give and take.\xc2\xa0 What about the give that the White House offers, can you offer any specific ideas or places where the White House is willing to give ground on health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, understand, you\'ve heard the President discuss in the interviews that he\xe2\x80\x99s done the notion of talking more fully about medical malpractice, something that you could put on the table and that we could discuss.\xc2\xa0 Understand this, Republican ideas that are already in the legislation that the Senate considered -- high-risk pools for uninsured with preexisting conditions; interstate compacts to allow coverage to be sold across state lines; low-cost catastrophic plans for the young; dependent coverage to age 26; grants for prevention and wellness programs with incentive for participation in employer wellness programs; and the SHOP Act, small business insurance pools that offer affordable coverage choices.</p>\n<p>So there are Republican ideas -- I think the latest figure I have from Nancy-Ann were 160 amendments that were offered in the committee process by Republicans that have been put into this bill.\xc2\xa0 But, Ben, that\'s the point of this -- as you saw the President discuss in Baltimore -- that we should listen to these ideas and we should have that discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like you could be taking the position of we, the White House, has listened and now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Republicans to give ground.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I didn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 The notion that Republican ideas aren\'t contained in the bill is just -- I think you know that\'s just simply not true.\xc2\xa0 If you think about the number of meetings that Senator Baucus had with Senator Grassley and Senator Enzi, the number of times that they spoke with the President on this issue; the notion that the President hasn\'t talked to Republicans is nothing more than a Republican -- a GOP party talking point.</p>\n<p>The point of this, Ben, is let\xe2\x80\x99s have a reasonable discussion.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s sit down and discuss these issues in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do this in a way where we can have this discussion.\xc2\xa0 We can have this discussion in front of the American people and we can decide what ideas we can all agree on.</p>\n<p>Understand this, Ben, I think what the President -- the last example the President was using, which was bipartisanship isn\'t going to be a hundred percent of your ideas or a hundred percent of my ideas, right?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 But there has to be give and take in that process and we have to understand that you may not get everything you want, but you may get some of what you want; and the other side may get some of that as well.\xc2\xa0 When Senator McConnell and Congressman Boehner both said today, as you heard the President discuss, that the status quo -- what we have currently is unacceptable, that we have to work together now to figure out that certainty and provide it to the American people to improve the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My point there is, is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s stand that it is still willing to give in that give-and-take?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We have been willing to give in that give-and-take this entire time, Ben.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last point on this -- sort of the underlying issue of bipartisanship here.\xc2\xa0 Does the President genuinely think that the Republican Leaders in the House and Senate want to work with him on jobs and on health care?\xc2\xa0 Is that his take?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got to have a sense of it by now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We take them at their word.\xc2\xa0 We take them at their word that they do, indeed, want to have -- they want to play a constructive role and they want to work with Democrats on making this happen.\xc2\xa0 Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer are working on the jobs tax credit on a bipartisan basis that could come up this week for a vote in the Senate.</p>\n<p>The President discussed -- there was a pretty lengthy discussion on ensuring credit to small businesses as something that both the White House and members of Congress in both parties believed was important for small business.\xc2\xa0 There was a discussion on the deficit and on ensuring that the fiscal commission be an outlet for that, understanding that Congressman Boehner and Senator McConnell both spoke in support of their respective -- the House and the Senate, their respective piece of legislation on that.</p>\n<p>So I think there is -- if we will understand what the President says in agreeing that we can have this give-and-take, I do think we can make progress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow up, Robert.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is saying no, though, to Boehner and McConnell calls for him to scrap the House and Senate health care bills and start from scratch.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s a non-starter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just like I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring their ideas to the table, right?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring the ideas that -- and there are some in their party that want to do away with, as you saw during the presidential campaign, the entire -- I wrote a few things down -- (laughter) -- I wrote, \xe2\x80\x9ceggs, milk, bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I crossed out \xe2\x80\x9cbread,\xe2\x80\x9d just so I could make pancakes for Ethan if it snows.\xc2\xa0 Then I wrote down \xe2\x80\x9chope\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cchange\xe2\x80\x9d just in case I forgot them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Came in handy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you sit with him all day?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, no, look, again, there are different ways of tax treatment for the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Again, like I say, there are some that want to do away with the tax deferral on health insurance provided it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s some that don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 There are those that want to -- that believe that there should be a broader restructuring of the Medicare Advantage Program that provides incentives for insurers to run a program that\'s already being run.\xc2\xa0 And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreement on that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the Republicans are not going to bring the ideas that they had last week to the table; and the President isn\'t going to scrap what has been a year-long process to get us to this point.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Missile defense.\xc2\xa0 Despite the President having scaled back and revised the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s missile defense strategy --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, your characterization of \xe2\x80\x9cscaled back\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crevised\xe2\x80\x9d --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Changed, let\xe2\x80\x99s just go changed.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- provided broader protection for Europe and the homeland to do it in a way that it is not just simply more cost effective but actually will have a better result in the event that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to argue with the semantics of it, but he\xe2\x80\x99s changed the plan.\xc2\xa0 Despite that, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s top general said today that the Russians still view the system as being directed against them and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this is what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up an agreement on a new START treaty.\xc2\xa0 Now, how is the administration going to overcome that obstacle and convince the Russians of the U.S. intentions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, when President Obama talked to President Medvedev a couple of weeks ago, President Medvedev didn\'t bring this up as an obstacle.\xc2\xa0 Our change in architecture for a missile plan that protected Europe and protected this homeland in a better way was announced last September, yet we have had substantive negotiations going on for many months.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that somehow this is in any way an impediment to what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with START is simply not true.\xc2\xa0 It certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what President Medvedev told President Obama.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, okay, Russian Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Nikolai Makarov, said, \xe2\x80\x9cdespite the declaration of those statesmen who say that on the contrary it provides for our security, that\'s far from the case.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would -- again, I hate to contradict the President of Russia in speaking to the President of the United States about getting a START deal done and not mentioning -- not mentioning in a phone call that\'s happening in the Oval Office something like this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 These negotiations are ongoing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s holding up the negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a series of things that -- look, whenever you get down to this point in the treaty you\'re taking conceptual agreements and putting them into words, and there are going to be some fights over different words and that\'s what they\xe2\x80\x99re working through.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you it\xe2\x80\x99s not our different approach to missiles.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans on the Hill have been critical of this administration for not getting them involved in the debate -- whether it be health care, reform or other issues as well.\xc2\xa0 The White House has now invited them to the White House today --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What other issues?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, financial reforms, you know, stimulus -- but they weren\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby up until Friday were working together on a bipartisan package for financial reform --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, critical, but they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been brought in through the process.\xc2\xa0 And now they\xe2\x80\x99re bring brought in now, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be brought in on the 25th again.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the White House in hindsight is saying, we should have involved Republicans all of last year; we should have done this long before now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re paving the road again to bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 But, Dan, you\'ve got to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This seems to be a more aggressive effort now to involved Republicans, certainly in health care reform --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\'s true.\xc2\xa0 Again, I will go back and try to figure out the number of times that the President talked to Republican senators in trying to get the finance committee to come to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 It was many, many times.\xc2\xa0 We hosted meetings down here.</p>\n<p>The notion -- it\xe2\x80\x99s quite revisionist to think that somehow -- remember in the summer there were all these questions about, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen are you just going to get through this whole finance committee thing and get to the floor\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Well, we spent hours and hours and hours, many conversations trying to bring Republicans and the finance committee along.\xc2\xa0 Senator Snowe did join in that finance committee vote and she did work constructively.\xc2\xa0 And we worked constructively with her.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m not just talking about that, but also health care reform as well.\xc2\xa0 They feel --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the entire reforms that have been going on -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s financial reform -- they feel that the Republicans have not been brought into this process early enough; the White House seems to be more aggressive in doing that now.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We have a fundamental disagreement about the premise of your question.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on that, just curious if you hadn\'t spent all that time talking to Republicans you might have passed health care reform before Christmas.\xc2\xa0 Big mistake?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought about a Lottery ticket yesterday -- maybe I would have won the Lottery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but, seriously.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was a mistake at all.\xc2\xa0 If we thought it was a mistake we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be doing what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 Again, remember this, the President -- remember the President went to Capitol Hill to talk to House Republicans about supporting the recovery plan, right?\xc2\xa0 Before we could load the pool up and get in the motorcade, they put out a statement opposing the recovery plan.</p>\n<p>Look, you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- this is exactly what the President said, Chip.\xc2\xa0 If bipartisanship means I\'m going to give up everything I believe and adopt everything that you believe, that\'s not bipartisanship, it\xe2\x80\x99s never been bipartisanship in this town.\xc2\xa0 If bipartisanship means we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take into account some of your ideas, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take into account some of our ideas, nobody is likely to get a hundred percent of what they want, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet somewhere in the middle to make progress on an issue for the American people.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the definition of bipartisanship has been for several hundred years and that\'s what we hope each party is interested in doing now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President gave the impression that there was -- when he was -- on the deficit, that there was a tone of bipartisanship in the room, and he was talking about pushing aside the idea of a bipartisan commission.\xc2\xa0 But immediately afterward both Boehner and McConnell came out and, Boehner in particular, said that the Democrats and the President have been on a spending binge.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they immediately went into full partisan mode and said the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need a bipartisan commission, all he needs is to make the tough decisions himself.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll get your congressional reporter to ask why, after a bipartisan meeting in discussing solutions -- Chip, nobody in their right mind could blame everything that\'s happened on one party in spending.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Nobody could.</p>\n<p>So whether they want to come out of the White House and a bipartisan meeting and somehow decide that history is far different than the way any normal human being would read it, that\'s up for them to defend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 The point is this -- the point is this, that Leader Boehner cosponsored a bill by Frank Wolf and Jim Cooper to set up a commission that didn\'t even have -- did not have an equal number of House Democrats and Republicans on the commission.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell, in a number of different venues, including in November on CNN, spoke quite passionately for the Conrad-Gregg Commission.</p>\n<p>The President weighed in and supported the Conrad-Gregg Commission, right?\xc2\xa0 Which is set up very similarly to the Wolf-Cooper proposal that Leader Boehner supported in the House.\xc2\xa0 We put that up for a vote.</p>\n<p>Now, if each party is serious in dealing with the deficit we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t normally think that you\'d need 60 votes in the Senate -- where you can pass something based on a majority -- you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\'d need 60 votes if each was serious about working on the deficit.\xc2\xa0 But, alas, that\'s what was asked for, 60 votes.\xc2\xa0 Right?</p>\n<p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s rewind and talk about what happened in that vote.\xc2\xa0 They got 53 votes -- not all Republicans supported it, not all Democrats supported it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s fine.\xc2\xa0 But we got 53 votes, seven short of the necessary 60.\xc2\xa0 Those seven votes could have been gotten by the six co-sponsors of that bill in December that decided not to vote for it, and a seventh -- an active co-sponsor that also decided not to vote for it.\xc2\xa0 There are the seven votes.</p>\n<p>But, look, Chip, the President has laid out -- laid out last year $17 billion worth of spending cuts and we got 60 percent of those.\xc2\xa0 The President has laid out $20 billion in spending cuts this year; we hope to get those.\xc2\xa0 If Congress wants to do better than that, the President is happy to look at it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President talked about, with Paul Ryan, a line-item veto.\xc2\xa0 They talked about recisions in there and the President will certainly look at those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the point is, hasn\'t it been made very clear to the President from the Republican Leaders that there is no compromise on both the bipartisan commission and health care reform, they want him to scrap the bill.\xc2\xa0 So for the President to keep pushing these things, isn\'t he engaging in this political theater by saying, come to table and talk to us --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear they\'re not going to.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Fifty-three senators supported a debt commission.\xc2\xa0 The senator who was at the meeting representing the Senate Republicans just two months ago said he supported it.\xc2\xa0 The Leader of the House Republicans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 So isn\'t it just political theater to keep harping on it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s political theater to, when something comes to a vote -- and the President is very clear about this, he said to both John and Mitch, he said, guys, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really work in this town if I say, yes, I\'m for that, and then you decide that you had been for that and now you\'re not.</p>\n<p>Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the definition of that is, Chip, and I presume you\'ll have a congressional correspondent ask Mitch McConnell and John Boehner why on earth each would support something and then when it came to a vote they would not support it.\xc2\xa0 The President -- look, they have concerns about -- what would be on the table.\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a budget process that will go on on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 If you have an idea about how to structure a budget, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got no problem voting on that.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that if the House Republicans or the Senate Republicans want to put forward a budget, that should be voted on, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine anybody would stand in the way of having that budget voted on.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, the President just mentioned his proposal to make TARP funds available for small banks to make small business lending.\xc2\xa0 How important is it that that be part of the package the Senate considers immediately?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I need to talk with legislative affairs and see where that is in the process of what\xe2\x80\x99s being considered by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But understand that to a person in this meeting everyone mentioned, prior to the discussion on how it would be structured, to a person every one of the Leaders, including the President, mentioned that getting capital to small businesses, allowing them to borrow money to meet payrolls or expand is one of the most important things that we can do.\xc2\xa0 Some other differences were discussed in terms of how that is structured --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether you can --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- but each of the -- the Leaders talked about how are you going to pay for this.\xc2\xa0 We have authority to use money to help banks get the capital they need to lend.\xc2\xa0 So this is, as both the Treasury Secretary, Dr. Summers, and Dr. Romer, all three of them said unless we do something like this, lending is going to contract.\xc2\xa0 We have this authority and that authority is -- the permissible authority under TARP is to get our financial system going through lending, that this was an easy, commonsense way to get that done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President highlighted, as did Senator McConnell out at the stakeout, the fact that the Republicans like some of his energy ideas -- clean coal, nuclear power.\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion in the meeting of moving forward with a comprehensive energy bill that would include those elements as well as some of the Democratic proposals?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell brought up some ideas that the President had proposed in the State of the Union that he thought many Republicans would support.\xc2\xa0 He mentioned, as you mentioned, clean coal technology, which the President has supported since running for office in Illinois in 2003 and 2004; mentioned increasing nuclear loans, which is in our budget; and talked about offshore oil drilling, something that the President supported at the end of the last campaign.</p>\n<p>I think, as you heard the President say, he certainly prepared to walk away from some in his party that think we can\'t do those things.\xc2\xa0 Now, in order to get some of this done, we need that give and take with the Republicans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did you have any of that?\xc2\xa0 Was there any serious --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That wasn\'t part of the -- that wasn\'t a long topic that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 I think the President said to Senator McConnell that if that\'s what he supports then he\'ll be pleasantly surprised at what the administration supports.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the State of the Union, the President made a mention of the three trade deals, but he didn\'t say they should be ratified, and there\'s been a lot of speculation on that.\xc2\xa0 Does he want them ratified this year, and if so is there political damage there because it\'s 2010 and labor certainly would not be happy with that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 George, again, this is a good example of what has to be give and take.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President mentioned those three.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t lay out a specific deadline, but the President believes that in order to create jobs here we have to increase the amount of exports that are leaving this country.\xc2\xa0 He has a very robust agenda on exports and they include those free trade agreements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you -- should they be ratified this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President didn\'t lay out timelines in the State of the Union and didn\'t do so in this meeting.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President just said that the American public has soured on the process in response to health care reform.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain how a health care summit two weeks from now will change that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what are you hoping to get in terms of conveying to the public something else is going on now?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President hopes an offshoot of this meeting with Democrats and Republicans is to take everybody at their word, including Senators McConnell and Leader Boehner today, that the status quo is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 You heard the President outline what\'s happening in California with the individual insurance market.\xc2\xa0 We understand that what we\'re doing now isn\'t sustainable.\xc2\xa0 It isn\'t sustainable when we deal with our deficit.\xc2\xa0 It isn\'t sustainable in what we do with our small businesses.</p>\n<p>Having this discussion, having everyone be able to see this discussion and being able to discuss openly the ideas that each party wants to bring to the table, the President believes can help move this process forward.\xc2\xa0 It started in what the President did in Baltimore and the President hopes it will continue on February 25th at the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Representative Cantor is already saying it\'s a dog and pony show and we have no interest in discussing the failed bills of the Democrats that have already been rejected by the American people.\xc2\xa0 He said that this morning.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I can\'t imagine --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So where\xe2\x80\x99s the avenue for discussion then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t imagine that a group that wanted to sit down and talk in a bipartisan way with the President about health care would now walk away from the process of sitting down in a bipartisan way and talking to the President on health care.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, David, that -- I mean, I hear crazy stuff in this town all the time, but to literally move one day from your talking points of "we need a transparent process where the President sits down and looks at and takes seriously our ideas on health care", and then the next day says, "my gosh, what you want us to do is in a transparent way sit down and talk about our ideas on health care?\xc2\xa0 Well, we can\'t possibly do that."</p>\n<p>So, look, Representative Cantor can decide whether he agrees with himself in yesterday\'s letter or whether he agrees with himself just a few weeks ago when he was making these arguments.</p>\n<p>Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the conditions that Republican leadership was asking for prior to the meeting is that reconciliation be taken off the table.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House willing to go there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sam, I think that Republicans should come to the White House to discuss their ideas without any preconditions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an answer really.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said there won\'t be any -- the President is not going to eliminate anything based on preconditions.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s one of their preconditions, the President doesn\'t agree to limiting the way we\'re going to discuss this.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, based on some of the reaching out that you just discussed with Chip on health care with the Republicans, does the President see this February 25th summit then as kind of a last chance for the Republicans to come to the table and agree on something or else he\'s just going to do it with Democratic votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t -- I think the President believes this is the next best chance to do it and the President is going to take Republicans seriously that they want to come discuss these issues.\xc2\xa0 You\'re laughing and I haven\'t even finished my answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All I want to know is how many more chances is he going to extend before he just says, they\'re not going to play so we\'re just going to go with Democratic votes?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill -- well, I think if there was a way to have solved this prior to today, we wouldn\'t be -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your notes-on-the-hand gag.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does the White House -- how closely did the White House monitor the tea party convention this weekend?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to what was said there --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Careful.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t watch it.\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t watch it at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, do you see the tea party movement as a real political force this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, it seems to be a very successful private enterprise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ohhh! ((Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say that there appear to be fewer speechmakers that are unemployed in this economy than what might have been previously reported.</p>\n<p>Look, I think whether you\'re part of an organized party, whether you\'re part of a movement that has a convention, I think what we saw in 2008, what we saw in Massachusetts, what we see across the country is a great deal of anxiety about what we\'ve been through.</p>\n<p>We discussed this a little on Friday when we talked about the jobs report.\xc2\xa0 The reformulation of how many jobs have been lost in this recession -- 8.4 million -- exceeds what had been lost in the recession of 1981, the recession of 1991, and the recession of 2001 combined.</p>\n<p>So for a long period of time this anxiety has built.\xc2\xa0 Whether you\'re, again, a Democrat or a Republican, an independent, a member of the tea party movement, you want to see this town be able to sit down and talk about their differences, but also not just focus on their differences.\xc2\xa0 I notice that a lot of questions in here focus on what we disagree on, not what we agree on.</p>\n<p>I think the President wants to sit down, whether it\'s in a bipartisan meeting to talk about the economy and jobs, whether it\'s in a bipartisan meeting to talk about health care, to find some agreement on what we\'re for.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of outlets for people to discuss what they\'re against.</p>\n<p>What the American people want us to do is come together and make some progress and move forward in what we agree on to help their lives, to help them pay for a college education, to help get this economy get restarted again, to help them get the credit they need to start or expand a small business.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the American people want to see this town work on, and I think that\'s what the President wants to work on, too.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:29 P.M.
