Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:34 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good to have you here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make at the top, so we will go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 I know that there\'s an event that Alabama fans probably are eager to cover, so we\'ll try to get you out before that starts.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I had a couple questions about the broader issue raised by the Secret Service controversy.\xc2\xa0 Lawmakers are raising questions that go to not just the morality of what happened but the security.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that those questions being raised on the Hill are legitimate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say two things.\xc2\xa0 First, as I think I said the other day, the Secret Service has made clear that with regard to this incident in Colombia, the President\'s security was never compromised.\xc2\xa0 The President has said, and I have reiterated, that he has high regard for and great appreciation for the extraordinary work that the Secret Service does to protect him, his family, those who travel with him.\xc2\xa0 And that regard remains high to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe incident in Colombia is under investigation by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 It continues to be under investigation.\xc2\xa0 And questions about broader concerns that aren\xe2\x80\x99t related specifically to this incident I think might be asked and dealt with after conclusions are reached in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 Right now I hesitate to take questions on sort of broader thematic issues while this investigation is underway.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously awaiting the conclusions of that investigation, and for now I think we\'ll keep focused on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but while that Secret Service investigation is happening -- and there\'s a military one as well -- about what happened in Colombia, lawmakers, in their oversight capacity, are asking those broader questions and they\'re not waiting for the Secret Service investigation.\xc2\xa0 They\'re scheduling their own hearings.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just wondering, from the White House perspective, the kind of questions that are being raised on the Hill are legitimate policy questions, or do you think that this is getting political?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Secret Service is an apolitical organization that provides security and protection to Presidents of both parties, of any party, first of all.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, without\xc2\xa0 -- I don\'t know specifically what questions are being asked, but it is certainly legitimate for congressional members -- members of Congress who have oversight responsibility to ask questions in the areas for which they\'re responsible.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t see any problem with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut right now, the Service is very focused on its investigation into this incident.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken clearly about his views on this when he had a press conference on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll await the results of that investigation before we can talk about broader issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other quick one on this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding that the President has not spoken to Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 If that is accurate, can you explain why he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t?\xc2\xa0 It might seem to the public that, in the course of trying to find out what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, that the President would make that phone call.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been kept very much up to speed on the situation with regards to this incident and the actions the Service has taken, the very swift actions the Service has taken to investigate this matter.\xc2\xa0 Senior officials within the White House have been in contact with Director Sullivan and others over at the Secret Service as part of that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has not spoken with Director Sullivan in recent days, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into that.\xc2\xa0 I think I said yesterday that the President has faith in the director, confidence in his leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I noted that Director Sullivan acted very quickly and swiftly in response to the incident that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic, quickly.\xc2\xa0 When the President, at an official event yesterday, said that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born with a silver spoon in his mouth and neither was the First Lady, was that in any way a reference to Governor Romney?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those of you who have covered President Obama know that he has used that phrase to describe his background many times in the past.\xc2\xa0 And I suppose anybody who thinks it was a reference to them might be a little oversensitive, because -- unless they think that when President Obama said it three years ago it was in reference to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is there any thought being given in the White House to asking Chairman Jaczko at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to step down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the reappointment of the Republican commissioner, the story about sexist comments from the chairman are coming back up to light.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is concerned at all about, going into the campaign where women are obviously a very important constituency group that the President is doing well with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly obvious statement of fact that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is not a political body.\xc2\xa0 It is responsible for overseeing nuclear facilities in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that we need to have an NRC that\'s functioning effectively.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, as I think has now been made clear in the media, the President will renominate\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ms. Sviniki, because he doesn\'t want to have a break in service in June when her current term expires.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons there\'s been controversy on the Hill about her nomination is because she and some other commissioners have accused the chairman of behaving badly towards women.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that may be the case and whatever review of that may take place.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the need to ensure that the NRC functions effectively and fulfills its responsibilities on behalf of the American people because of the high priority he puts on nuclear safety.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he speak to the chairman very often?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The only time I can remember was during the Fukushima disaster, and I believe he did, at that time, meet with him because of the earthquake and tsunami that led to the situation at the reactor in Japan.\xc2\xa0 And I think the chairman was here for briefings on a couple of occasions during that time period.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the White House let Senator Majority Leader Reid know about this report ahead of time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we communicate with the Senate Majority Leader all the time, so I would assume that the answer to that is yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just ask one question on a separate issue.\xc2\xa0 There appears to be the potential or beginnings of a war between Sudan and South Sudan.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is watching, and what is your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are, of course, watching that matter, and I\'ve discussed it in the past from this podium.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very concerned about stability in that region.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve very concerned about the need for actions to be taken to reduce potential conflict there.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything specific to discuss with you in reaction to recent developments in the last few days, but absolutely, we\'re very focused on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me go to Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two different topics.\xc2\xa0 First of all, Secretary Clinton just told ministers in Paris that if the Kofi Annan peace place isn\'t successful, the U.N. should pass a resolution saying it would intervene using all means necessary -- Section 7.\xc2\xa0 Why does the administration think that this is necessary and appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That what is necessary and appropriate?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That this is what the U.N. should do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think, again, the Secretary, as you report to me, has just said this.\xc2\xa0 But we are very concerned about the failure thus far of the Assad regime to fulfill its obligations under the Kofi Annan plan that it promised it would.\xc2\xa0 It is an incomplete cease-fire at best.\xc2\xa0 We are working with our allies and partners within the "Friends of Syria" framework as well as broadly within the United Nations to consider next steps should the Annan plan not succeed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately, our focus is on the need for a cease-fire, the need for a withdrawal of government forces from regions of the country, the need to provide humanitarian and other non-lethal assistance to the Syrian people and the opposition, and the need for a peaceful process to begin that would allow the Syrian people to determine their own political future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the U.S. would now be prepared to potentially provide arms to some of the --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position has not changed, which is that we do not believe that is the right course of action, because further militarization of Syria could lead to even more devastating consequences.\xc2\xa0 We believe there is still the possibility of the preferred outcomes here, which is a withdrawal by Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces, a cease-fire withdrawal, and a political process that is peaceful that allows the Syrian people to have a better future and one that is more democratic.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re fully aware of the fact that the Syrian regime is not -- and not for the first time -- is not living up to its obligations fully.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring that very carefully.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On the Secret Service -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve announced, or they -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that they\xe2\x80\x99re forming an external board to study the culture of the service.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House or the President plan to name some of the members of the board?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you on that kind of review or further steps that might be taken.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on awaiting the results of the completed investigation of the incident in Colombia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that whenever Director Sullivan decides to retire years from now -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s years from now or if it\xe2\x80\x99s in the near future -- that at some point in the future the Secret Service should be run by somebody outside the culture of the Secret Service, the way the FBI is run by somebody from outside the culture?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we are about four days or five days into this incident -- six days into this incident.\xc2\xa0 To then speculate about what might happen in the future with regard to this agency is I don\xe2\x80\x99t think particularly illuminating.\xc2\xa0 So right now we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on this investigation, this incident, finding out what happened, holding people accountable and responsible for transgressions, if they occurred, and then making other assessments as necessary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that, as I stated in response to an earlier question, that the Secret Service is filled with men and women who put their lives on the line to protect the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the implications of that are not about the personal security of one individual or one individual\'s family, but the -- sort of the essence of our democracy, the ability for our democracy to function, which requires the protection of the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you already know that two GS-14 level supervisors have left as a result of this, and that you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, I understand that you and everyone else here has a reporting interest in getting facts as quickly as you can with regards to this investigation, and I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been there, and I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 But we are not going to pre-judge outcomes and discuss the future of this agency in a press briefing while this investigation is going on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is this is an incident that requires investigation.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service has acted with speed in addressing the matter, investigating the matter, holding people accountable, and continuing to push forward with the investigation.\xc2\xa0 When there are results of the investigation and we can assess those, we may have more to say about it.\xc2\xa0 But it is not helpful to the process for us to speculate about what we might, or an administration might do in response to an investigation whose results are not yet concluded.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the second serious security breach to take place under Director Sullivan\'s watch.\xc2\xa0 The first one, of course, has to do with the White House crashers for the state dinner.\xc2\xa0 How many incidents like this do there have to be before the President loses confidence in his Secret Service director?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will restate what I\'ve said, Jake.\xc2\xa0 The President has confidence in Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 He has great appreciation and regard for the men and women of the Secret Service who perform their duties admirably and at risk to their own lives.\xc2\xa0 That is not to excuse any behavior or activity that was in appropriate.\xc2\xa0 The incident is under investigation, but, again, I think it is unhelpful --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What more do you need to know?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What more?\xc2\xa0 Quite a bit more, Jake.\xc2\xa0 This thing is under investigation.\xc2\xa0 This incident became -- happened last week, became public very quickly after it happened.\xc2\xa0 The investigation was launched immediately, and we\'re several days into an investigation.\xc2\xa0 I think it is very much in the interests of everyone, and most importantly, of the United States and its security service here -- the Secret Service, with regards to the mission it is charged with -- to allow this investigation to be completed before we make judgments based on conclusions we don\'t yet have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President talks a lot about accountability, people in the government being held accountable.\xc2\xa0 It seems as though incidents happen in this administration, and have happened in this administration, and people are not held accountable.\xc2\xa0 Maybe lower-level people --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me just -- I know you were covering this yesterday, but based on the reports I read that I think you and others filed, people have already been held accountable or have held themselves accountable in this very incident that has been under investigation for a few days.\xc2\xa0 So I think the swift --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Harry Truman did not have a plaque on his desk that said "the buck stops there" -- okay?\xc2\xa0 The point is that accountability rises -- people are in charge of agencies and they are held accountable for the behavior of the people that they are in charge of.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And perhaps, Jake, perhaps, it would be in the interest of a complete and thorough and fair investigation not to make determinations about the conclusions of an investigation before they\'ve even been reached.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a position that is -- fits naturally into a general sense of appropriateness and justice and the pursuit of the truth.\xc2\xa0 And that is the position we\'re going to take.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one other question.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about this before in this room, about the President\'s trips to battleground states in which he has an event and then he has a fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 And I know you\'ve talked more recently when Ann asked you about how the language in these different official versus campaign events are often quite similar.\xc2\xa0 What is your message to taxpayers when they see the President flying on Air Force One, doing one official event, one campaign event, flying back, knowing that in a lot of ways, taxpayers are paying for the President to campaign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re not, first of all, because as in other administrations, including our immediate predecessors, as you know, we follow all the rules and regulations to ensure that the DNC or other relevant political committee pays what is required for the President or First Lady to travel to political events.\xc2\xa0 And this -- we go absolutely by the book with regard to the payments according to -- depending on which events are campaign or political and which are official.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe suggestion that there is something wrong with the fact that the President says the same thing about what his vision is and what his policies are and what his beliefs are in front of official audiences, non-political audiences as he does in front of audiences who are his supporters I think is kind of ridiculous.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think it is a testament to his absolute constancy and consistency that he -- this goes back to Ann\xe2\x80\x99s question -- that, yes, when he stands before supporters who are donating to his campaign, who may be wealthy, and says, it is only appropriate that the wealthiest among us do our fair share so that everybody gets a fair shot -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the same message he has when he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the need to pass the Buffett Rule in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Totally -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the way it should be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, with regards to the way every President who\'s been running for reelection in our lifetimes deals with these matters, it is by the book, very carefully done and appropriately done.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, Jake, the President is the President 24 hours a day and seven days a week, and he has to fly on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 He has to have security and communication.\xc2\xa0 There are elements of his job that are always with him, regardless of whether he\xe2\x80\x99s in a campaign event or an official event.\xc2\xa0 And costs are apportioned accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the issue is that President Obama is fundraising more than any President before.\xc2\xa0 Each President -- you could say this about each President -- that he has broken records for fundraisers than the one before; that President Obama has attended dozens more fundraisers than President Bush had done at this point in his presidency, and is going to visit battleground states more than any President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a fact that I\'d like to contest, because when that was first raised based on a Wall Street Journal article that included Virginia as evidence -- the President\'s trips to Virginia as evidence of traveling to battleground states, but when it was noted that they didn\'t include that when assessing President George W. Bush\'s travel in 2004 -- they didn\'t include Virginia because nobody thought Virginia was contested, and if you did include Virginia, Bush actually traveled to more battleground states at an earlier period of time.\xc2\xa0 So the President should not be penalized for the fact that the voters of Virginia decided to vote for him in 2008.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know the states he\'s visited the most this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And 2012, we hope.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I don\'t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The two states he\'s visited the most this year are Ohio and Florida.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just a coincidence?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two very populous states; very important states. And I\'m sure he\'ll be back to those states as well as others.\xc2\xa0 We were recently in Oklahoma.\xc2\xa0 I\'m an eternal optimist, but I\'m prepared to suggest that it\'s unlikely that anyone would call that a battleground state.\xc2\xa0 He gave a major speech in Nebraska Kansas -- again, prepared to suggest that that\'s not a battleground state, although a portion of it was in 2008.*</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at everyone in the news organizations and all their maps about what states are up for grabs and that kind of stuff, and say the President can\'t go to those states, you\'re basically saying he can\'t go to half the country -- he can\'t go to -- and probably far greater than half in terms of population. He can\'t go to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody is saying he can\'t go to those states, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The question is should they be declared campaign trips?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying he cannot make official event -- make official trips to a significant portion of the country because you guys have declared them battleground states.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 Some of the states you\'ve declared battleground states had never been won by a Democrat before until -- for years and years before 2008, or President Obama won by double digits in 2008.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not -- that\'s a battleground state now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, it is impossible for him to appropriately do his job and travel around the country and talk with the American people if he is guided by that kind of narrow view of what is a battleground state or a safe state for a Democrat or a safe state for a Republican.\xc2\xa0 He\'s President of all the people, all of the United States, and will travel accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President said on Sunday that he would withhold his anger on the Secret Service until the allegations were investigated.\xc2\xa0 Three people are now gone, so misconduct is really not a --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The investigation is continuing, Roger, and I think as I\'ve said a few times now, we will await the results of the full investigation, the complete results of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 As I noted to Jake, obviously some action has been taken, but as has also been made clear, the investigation is still underway.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll await the results of that investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have no update on that.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, we\'ll wait until the investigation is completed.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn and then Donovan and then April.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has anybody from the West Wing Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office talked to any of the West Wing staffers or the Executive Office of the President staffers who were in Cartagena on what they know preceded that week?\xc2\xa0 Was there any involvement at all by members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s staff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are conversations that have happened at senior White House staff levels with the Secret Service and with Director Sullivan, but not with regards -- as I understand it -- with regards to the incident itself, which did not -- has to do with members of the Secret Service and members of the military.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re positive there were no White House Executive Office of the President employees involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard otherwise, Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to change the tone to dogs.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Has the President -- does he know about the recent back-and-forth about Republicans picking out this section of his book where he eats dog and making a big issue out of it?\xc2\xa0 And is there any opinion on whether that\xe2\x80\x99s -- does he know about it?\xc2\xa0 What does he think about it?\xc2\xa0 What do you think of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, he keeps up with the news.\xc2\xa0 He may know about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know more than that.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a reference in his book to a period when he was six or seven years old.\xc2\xa0 Making a big deal out of it sounds like somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s trying to get out of the doghouse on something.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But -- it just occurred to me to say that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril, you\xe2\x80\x99re next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 The President was talking about standards for those in the delegation that travels with him.\xc2\xa0 But when you talk about standards with the Secret Service, can you get into their conduct clause in their contracts that they have to sign?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no knowledge of any employment contracts that the Secret Service has.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not my field.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When they\xe2\x80\x99re hired there is a certain --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I have --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, now back on Sudan with what Jeff had asked.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had a chance to talk to China as of yet?\xc2\xa0 George Clooney, when he was here, he said that the President did acknowledge he wanted to talk to China about the issues to help fix the problem there over oil.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, in reference to that comment -- I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at sequencing here -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember when that was in relation to the President\xe2\x80\x99s bilateral meeting with President Hu fairly recently.\xc2\xa0 And while I would have to get back to you on specifics, when the President has a bilateral meeting with his Chinese counterpart, they cover a whole range of issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But George Clooney specifically said in a stakeout that the President would --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I can\'t remember if that was before or after the bilateral, and I will have to get back to you on whether or not Sudan was discussed at the bilateral.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\'ve expressed that the President wants to wait until the full investigation has been completed in the Secret Service scandal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are you guys doing pieces on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Am I picking up something here?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the director of the Secret Service has already revealed to members of Congress that at least 20 women were signed in as guests to this hotel where the President\'s staff and the presidential press corps stayed.\xc2\xa0 What was the President\'s reaction when he learned that three members of the Secret Service are now gone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to report to you.\xc2\xa0 Again, the matter is still under investigation.\xc2\xa0 The President made clear just a few days ago when he was asked about this that, A, if the allegations that had surfaced in the media and been reported turned out to be true he would indeed by very angry; B, that he believes that whether it\'s the Secret Service or the State Department or the White House or any other agency of government, that those of us who travel abroad representing the United States of America need to conduct ourselves appropriately because we are representing not just him but the entire country, and every American across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think his views on this are quite clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I\'m not prepared to do is to offer you sort of day-by-day commentary on new revelations or even new actions taken with regards to this investigation while it\'s still underway.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to the process.\xc2\xa0 The President has made his views clear as they are now while the matter is under investigation.\xc2\xa0 When that investigation is concluded I\'m sure there will be an opportunity for you all to ask him questions at some point about this if you want to, or he may express his opinions more fully about it.\xc2\xa0 But for now, it\'s just not -- it\'s not helpful to, again, offer day-by-day, play-by-play commentary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s helpful to the process or helpful to the reputation of the Secret Service to have daily details leak out about what kind of behavior occurred in Colombia?\xc2\xa0 Or should there be some quick and decisive action taken?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll leave it to -- I mean, you cited some of the ways that details have been revealed -- or alleged details have been revealed.\xc2\xa0 There is a responsibility of Congress to have oversight, as we discussed earlier, and I\'m sure the Secret Service is in conversation with relevant members of Congress for that reason.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are focused on allowing this process to continue and to conclude before we comment further.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President convinced this is an isolated incident?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that would be a conclusion that you would have to reach after you actually investigated this incident.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then a final question.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you to respond to Senator Sessions, who up on the Hill today suggested that the President is in part to blame, and that the President needs to assert discipline and direction throughout the executive branch, and Presidents are to be held responsible.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sense that this President has shown managerial leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That sounds very much like a lawmaker attempting to politicize something that is not at all political.</p>\n<p>\n\tWendell.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Budget Director Zients has sent the House Appropriations Committee a letter asking for a commitment to abide by spending limits before the President will sign appropriations bills.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that for us, please?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we actually think that members of Congress ought to keep their word.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And then Alexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How likely do you think -- I mean, this has a long way to go before he would be even be in a position of vetoing it.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the Senate would actually go along with this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mara, call us na\xc3\xafve but we did not -- we actually did not think -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even take a handshake on it, we insisted on legislation that was voted on and passed and signed into law by significant percentages of Republicans in both houses.\xc2\xa0 But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when they did this that they were crossing their fingers behind their backs.\xc2\xa0 They either keep their word or they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is an agreement in place that set spending levels at historic lows -- non-defense, discretionary spending levels -- at lows we have not seen since the Eisenhower administration.\xc2\xa0 They represent $2 trillion in deficit reduction commitments.\xc2\xa0 That is significant.\xc2\xa0 Now, you have to ask yourself, why are they going back on their word?\xc2\xa0 Why are they insisting on deeper cuts in programs we need to sustain and grow our economy -- investments in education and innovation and research and development -- why? Well, because they have a plan in place that requires more tax cuts for the wealthy, and they need to pay for it somehow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what do they do?\xc2\xa0 They ask the middle class and they ask seniors to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 And how do they do that?\xc2\xa0 By busting their own -- violating their own agreement, by failing to live up to and keep their word.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re opposed to that -- pretty simple.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the proposed new trajectory for the pipeline improve the President\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in moving the permit forward and agreeing to that anytime soon?\xc2\xa0 And on the contrast, is the congressional action related to Keystone also moving it forward or slowing it down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Two questions and on the first one, I think it was -- there was some confusion initially about what happened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear.\xc2\xa0 TransCanada -- Canadian corporation -- in accordance with legislation passed by the Nebraska legislature, submitted -- made a submission to Nebraska.\xc2\xa0 No submission for any permit has yet been made to the State Department, in accordance with the necessary procedures that exist here and have existed for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President has said, if and when an alternate route proposal is submitted to the State Department for consideration, it will be duly considered without bias and in accordance with the procedures that are longstanding and required when we\'re talking about the approval of a pipeline that crosses U.S. borders with a foreign country and is built by a foreign company.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, there is an effort -- going to your second question -- and not for the first time, an effort by Congress -- members of Congress who seem to think it is a wise decision to preemptively approve something that will be done -- in violation of many, many years of precedent, approve a pipeline that would be built by a foreign company, that emanates from a foreign country without knowing where that pipeline would go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need -- the process is built -- is designed in a way that\'s very sensible.\xc2\xa0 And the only reason why we\'re in this position now is because Republicans in Congress decided to hijack that process for political reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me be clear.\xc2\xa0 Back in November, when the permit initial submission was denied, it was denied in large part because the Governor of Nebraska, a Republican, had requested that it be denied.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, there was an occasion, an opportunity, and that remains the case today, for the company in question here to submit a new proposal for an alternate route.\xc2\xa0 They seem to have taken a step in Nebraska to meet requirements set by the Nebraskan legislature.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said when he was in Oklahoma, we anticipate a submission by TransCanada in the future and we\'ll judge it accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Chuck Grassley yesterday said that, "If heads don\'t roll, we\'re not going to get any change in the culture of the organization," meaning the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will answer you as I have answered others -- that the President will be angry if it turns out that the allegations that have surfaced in the press about this incident turn out to be true.\xc2\xa0 He is awaiting the conclusions of an investigation that is ongoing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn response specifically to the comments by the Senator you quoted, I think that, based on the reports I saw in the media, there has been some accountability already.\xc2\xa0 But this matter remains under investigation.\xc2\xa0 Other individuals at Secret Service remain part of this review, and of course there\'s the -- those individuals in the military.\xc2\xa0 So the process continues.\xc2\xa0 We will not offer day-by-day commentary on it, even as others might.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he satisfied that the investigation is moving quickly enough?\xc2\xa0 And does he have a date by which he would like to see this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not have a date for you.\xc2\xa0 I think it is an observable fact that the investigation has moved -- was started quickly, is moving with some speed.\xc2\xa0 Having said that, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important also that any investigation of this nature be done thoroughly and fairly.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe to put on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the Secret Service supervisors who was fired yesterday is reportedly planning to sue.\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the President that this is going to drag out into an election year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I make two points.\xc2\xa0 One, I have no comment to make on that specific thing.\xc2\xa0 And just to -- again, contrary to the efforts of some apparently in Congress, this has nothing to do with politics or the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier and then Carol.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in your answer to Jessica it sounded like you haven\xe2\x80\x99t given up hope on the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, in a word, why?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going on, on the ground in Syria that would give you any optimism at all that this is going to work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 We support the Annan plan, as has every member of the United Nations Security Council, as have numerous nations around the region and the world.\xc2\xa0 But we are horrified by reports of significant violations of the cease-fire by the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 Our Ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, is consulting with the Security Council today on next steps as the cease-fire continues to unravel.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m simply not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of those consultations or what may emanate from them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is still our hope, obviously, that Assad ceases to attack his own people, that he enforces a cease-fire and withdraws his soldiers and heavy equipment from those regions of the country that have been identified under the Annan plan.\xc2\xa0 He does not seem to be abiding by that, and that is of great concern to us.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re having these consultations.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- I did say Carol next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said a couple times that senior White House officials have been in touch with Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 Who are those officials?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every individual that has been in touch with the agency with regards to this.\xc2\xa0 But senior officials within the -- on the White House staff and Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office have been consulting with Director Sullivan and others, and ensuring that the President is kept informed of this matter. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond that for you.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I said the Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any names for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And secondarily, on the fundraiser tonight at the W Hotel, why is that closed press?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to look at it.\xc2\xa0 If there are no remarks -- I mean, we open fundraising remarks on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s not making remarks and he\xe2\x80\x99s just visiting with folks, then they tend to be closed press.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs someone who spent many, many hours on the driveway outside homes during the Bush administration, the fundraisers when the President then was making remarks, I can tell you that I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that we\xe2\x80\x99re ensuring that you\xe2\x80\x99re there when he gives remarks at fundraisers.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, in red.\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes, hi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the renationalization of the YPF with Argentina the other day -- I know you were asked this two days ago -- but do you have anything further for us on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish I did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would have to refer you to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 I can take the question again.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In green.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to mix it up a little bit here.\xc2\xa0 Sorry --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jessica, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any response to the launch of the missile at India towards China, particularly the criticism by the Chinese press that Western powers were not condemnatory enough?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we understand that India did test-launch a ballistic missile earlier today.\xc2\xa0 We urge all nuclear-capable states to exercise restraint regarding nuclear and missile capabilities, and continue to discourage actions that might destabilize the South Asia region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply point out, because comparisons have been made to the DPRK and its actions, that India\xe2\x80\x99s record stands in stark contrast to that of North Korea, which has been subject to numerous sanctions, as you know, by the United Nations Security Council.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, Goyal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as this missile tested by India is concerned, upcoming U.S.-India strategy dialogue is coming at the highest level.\xc2\xa0 Is there any discussion going to be about this missile test?\xc2\xa0 And also, China\xe2\x80\x99s threat in the region is imminent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe the State Department does.\xc2\xa0 I think my reaction -- our reaction to this missile test is what I just provided to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on World Bank?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The World Bank just opened its meetings, and they are concerned about three things -- one, poverty around the globe, high rise of oil prices, and corruption.\xc2\xa0 And now, World Bank has a new president, of course, selected by the President.\xc2\xa0 This is great news for the World Bank officials.\xc2\xa0 So anything the President wants to say about these issues?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think those issues all merit concern.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:18 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
