GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- let me do a quick readout from the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan meeting -- Pakistan meeting this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama met for nearly two hours with his national security team on Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 At the beginning of the meeting, President Obama and Secretary Clinton reaffirmed the great debt that the administration and the American people owe to Richard Holbrooke and noted the extraordinary expressions of respect from Ambassador Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s life, demonstrated -- demonstrate the legacy that he\xe2\x80\x99s built over 50 years of service to his country.</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth General Petraeus and Ambassador Eikenberry noted that many Afghans had expressed their condolences to Ambassador Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s family to them over the course of the past day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President then reviewed the findings of the draft national security staff-led report on the progress that has been made in implementing our strategy, focusing on the three different components of the review:\xc2\xa0 al Qaeda senior leadership, Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn each area, the President and his team discussed both the progress that has been made as well as areas for additional focus moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President directed his team to finalize the report, while also continuing to address the range of issues discussed in the report as we head into 2011.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will provide an update on our strategy to the American people on Thursday as he presents the findings of the review, along with members of his senior national security team.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is he going to do that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Somewhere on the grounds.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be off-site.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afternoon or morning or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time with me on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s in addition to the Wednesday Gates and Clinton --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I have not seen tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 This is the standalone AfPak review meeting that we talked about yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Thursday, I meant Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the -- you said that the President, I believe you said, directed the staff to finalize the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he want changes?\xc2\xa0 Was he content with the review as it stands?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, there were some changes that -- as they went -- the President has obviously over the course of the past several days been reviewing different sections of the review itself, and asked, after some discussion, that some parts be augmented, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were in the meeting the whole time, is that correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was in there for most of the time, but not the entire time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the tenor of the conversation?\xc2\xa0 Was there dissent among the principals about the level of progress or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- I mean, I think that when you see the review on Thursday, I doubt there will be, in all honesty, a lot of surprise at what the review lays out.\xc2\xa0 I think you will see, as many of you have written and reported, that there has been some important progress in halting the momentum of the Taliban in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We have seen, through counterterrorism, success at degrading senior al Qaeda leaders.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen greater cooperation over the course of the past 18 months with the Pakistani government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou will also see in the review an enumeration of the continued challenges that we have in that region.\xc2\xa0 They will focus on a few different areas, but clearly we have to strengthen -- continue to strengthen capacity inside of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And we still have the ongoing challenge and threat of safe havens in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So -- plus I think you have overlaid with that the progress that an agreement that we saw in Lisbon with NATO and ISAF in agreeing on a strategy of beginning the transition in 2011 through 2014, where Afghans will take full responsibility for their nation and for their security.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a tenor of what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Again, a lot of that has been -- a decent amount of that you guys have covered and reported over the past several months.\xc2\xa0 And I think this was an opportunity for the national security team to evaluate the progress and identify further challenges a little -- slightly more than a year after the President laid down a different strategy late last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said see tomorrow -- you mean Thursday, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thursday, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Mara got me all confused.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My fault.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that when you talk -- when you just recap the areas of progress -- and the President has also talked about those -- that the review will enshrine the President sees enough progress to stick with pulling troops home starting in July and the 2014 timeline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the review, as I said yesterday, will say that we are -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress and we still have many challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say -- but that the view is that our transition can and should begin, a conditions-based transition, of our added forces in July 2011, just as NATO came -- NATO also came to the conclusion of beginning to transfer some security in different regions and parts of the country at the beginning of next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last quick question.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration begin to fill the void of Ambassador Holbrooke, particularly given his history, but also where you are in this war review?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a few things about Richard, because I think that -- I think our focus over the past almost 24 hours I think has been on what he would want us to focus on, and that is continuing to get this policy right.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been focusing on that, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on the tremendous impact that his career has had over many decades and on many issues that have been at the forefront of our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 I think he was a public servant in the truest sense of those words.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our focus has been on celebrating the diplomatic life and the life that he had with his family and friends -- and focus, quite frankly, less so on what might be next for that position.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously Richard had a very talented team that continues even today to do the work that Secretary Clinton and President Obama asked him to do many months ago.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people, as you heard the President and the First Lady say last night in their statement, are indebted to his service.\xc2\xa0 And their thoughts and prayers and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he attend a service for him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think scheduling is checking on when that might be.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s been announced since the last time I heard this this morning.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the answer to that yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying with Ambassador Holbrooke for a moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that his final words were, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to stop this war in Afghanistan.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What do you make of that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alister, I would point you to -- and I think you should all check what P.J. Crowley said at the top of his briefing today.\xc2\xa0 P.J. has talked to a number of people that were in the room or familiar with the situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s emblematic of the fact that Richard was always focused on the task at hand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think if you look at that transcript, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see there\xe2\x80\x99s a little back and forth as the medical staff is trying to get him to calm down and relax at some point, and he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s worried about Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the doctor says, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us focus on this.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOkay, great, you end the war in Afghanistan.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to P.J. on this because he\xe2\x80\x99s done some checking around on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just change tracks.\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- to talk about the tax package -- is the President willing to discuss any change in the estate tax with the House to secure the backing of House Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Alister, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to -- I think we answered something similar to this yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the test vote in the Senate last night, the procedural vote, demonstrates the broad bipartisan support that the agreement enjoys not just in the Senate but with the American people and that we believe that what the Senate will pass, we hope today, will be the framework for what is taken up and agreed quickly by the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The region of Afghanistan and Pakistan is obviously so complicated yet so important to this administration that appointing somebody of the nature of Richard Holbrooke to a lot of foreign policy experts made sense because he was well known, he\xe2\x80\x99d been doing it for decades.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk at all about who you think could replace him or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to be a career foreign service person?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if those discussions have begun at State.\xc2\xa0 There were no discussions of that in the meeting this morning and I have not heard discussions amongst the team here at the White House on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur focus, obviously, as I said a moment ago, is on completing the review that Richard had been a big part of and to celebrate the life that he lived.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think in many ways, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would disagree, that -- the clich\xc3\xa9 would be \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got big shoes to fill.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably a safe -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a safer thing to say that Ambassador Holbrooke is, as the President said, a giant in foreign policy and is not -- is irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is not to say that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be somebody that the President picks.\xc2\xa0 I think Richard possessed some very unique qualities.\xc2\xa0 His experience went back to the conflict in Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 All of you are -- know of the role that he played in bringing peace to the war-torn regions of Bosnia.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in many ways he was a unique figure in American foreign policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One senior administration official said that one of the reasons so many people thought of him sometimes as a pain is because he would find a friction point in a meeting and he would charge right for it, bringing up whatever conflict there was, and that that might have been lacking at today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting since he was not there.\xc2\xa0 Was there anybody to serve that role?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the process that concluded today on the review is a process -- is a two-month process.\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion that vast arguments would break out at that point in the process, the interagency process, is probably not what the administration official had in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say, and I think -- look, it\xe2\x80\x99s why you want somebody of that experienced level and that stature, and you want somebody who will bore down on the problems and the challenges that you face.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that was certainly one of the things that Richard did.\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt that his presence will be sorely missed.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he created and had a very talented team at the State Department that will continue the work that he did as somebody who was -- who played a big role in the formulation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and who was enormously supportive of the series of decisions that the President made at the end of last year and was -- that he was helping to carry out on the civilian side in both countries this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the war is going better now than it was a year ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any doubt.\xc2\xa0 We have -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see this from the review, and again, I preface it by saying it is not without its challenges.\xc2\xa0 It is not without --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re losing more troops than we were a year ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think that is the sad impact of having more forces to stem the momentum that the Taliban had been making.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we would not be seeing either security or civilian progress were it not for the stemming of that momentum.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, the President argued for years that we needed more forces, even as more forces were diverted to other conflicts, away from what the President believes was the central front.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in the review when it\xe2\x80\x99s made -- when a summary is made public, that because of the increased troop level, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to push back on the Taliban in important areas of the country, something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happening until more forces were added.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMany challenges remain.\xc2\xa0 As I said, as we have seen success, we understand that that success without following up in the capacity building of either Afghanistan as a whole, or those regions specifically, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard either from a security or a governmental perspective to hold those areas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to recruit, retain -- recruit, train and retain a security force of police and army to be able to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou also have to create the civilian capacity that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to deliver both the basic functions of either a regional or a national government and continue to make progress in doing so in order to hold those regions.\xc2\xa0 All of that is what continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the report needing to be finalized and that there will be some changes, are these changes for clarity, or are things being added that the President thought should be in there that were not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think a little of -- I would say, I\xe2\x80\x99d use both your examples, both for clarity and for the addition of things he thought should be in there.\xc2\xa0 I would say this, this is -- the President did not make major changes today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will there be anything in the review about Pakistan and that country needing to step up more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, without a doubt.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, the -- and I may have cut you off.\xc2\xa0 Let me let you finish your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s three aspects of the review:\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan, al Qaeda and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is sort of along the lines of what I was telling Jake, and that is, we have seen over the course of many months an increased willingness to cooperate from the Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 But as you saw in both -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in this review and in reports that have been sent up I think early fall, late last summer, that there are things that we still need Pakistan to continue to cooperate with us more on and continue to do in order to prevent further safe havens from impacting the progress that ultimately can be made in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will that be laid out in blunt ways or blunt language being used about what Pakistan needs to do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re clear -- we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly clear with our partners in Pakistan on this.\xc2\xa0 And I think it will be clear, again, in the document that as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen greater cooperation, our challenges there remain.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the tax cuts, the President yesterday when he came out here to the briefing room talked about I believe making phone calls to some of these House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Has he been able to sway any minds there, those who have not been supportive of this, change their minds?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that I think the President has had some good conversations.\xc2\xa0 And I think we are on a path toward getting this agreement through the House and ultimately to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, to ensure that middle-class families don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on the 1st of January.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he continue making more calls today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect anything in the report that is made public or that he enunciates on Thursday to point to any change in the beginning of a troop withdrawal schedule next July?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think we are on course for the July 2011 date, based on the conditions, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve always heard the President say.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he indicate how large or small that withdrawal is likely to be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he will, with the Secretary of Defense and with commanders on the ground, work through as we approach that day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So basically what you\xe2\x80\x99re telegraphing and what has been suggested for weeks is that there\xe2\x80\x99s progress being made, so don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about everything.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s all moving ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I -- maybe you misunderstood the word \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge\xe2\x80\x9d that I used a couple of half-dozen times.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 If I can, I think you have seen in areas dealing with each of the three aspects of the report -- the momentum with the -- stopping and stemming some of the momentum of the Taliban, increased cooperation with the Pakistanis, and the degradation of al Qaeda leadership -- progress on all three of those fronts, with challenges small and great that continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t -- nobody expected that we would come out at a year into this and say, \xe2\x80\x9cGood news, all is well, and we can pack up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not was --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anybody say that there\xe2\x80\x99s been major progress on perhaps the biggest issue -- the one that was apparently on Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s last words -- and that is dealing with the sanctuary which al Qaeda has in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, that was one of, I think, one of the things that I outlined earlier that will be -- that remains one of our central challenges.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- without a doubt, safe haven in Pakistan by a whole series of people makes security and progress in Afghanistan more challenging.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that in the review when the review is released, just as I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that, again, reported I think many places before the review.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple issues on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the House is introducing a standalone bill today.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that perhaps a standalone bill is the best way to get this policy repealed legislatively?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I think the President is -- believes that the best way to change this policy is through a legislative vehicle.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Secretary Gates as recently as his -- coming back from his trip to Afghanistan, that his strong belief is that the policy will change one of two ways:\xc2\xa0 either through the court system or through Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis preferred and our preferred method is to do this legislatively through Congress.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope -- you saw a vote late last week, 57 senators support repeal.\xc2\xa0 There were some absences and things like that.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe -- you can without a doubt say that a number far exceeding a majority is supportive of the repeal of that policy as you\xe2\x80\x99d seen previously in the House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we have a strong chance to change that policy before Congress leaves the end of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the calendar goes by, is the President becoming worried that time may be running out on this issue for this Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s time enough to get several things done.\xc2\xa0 The tax agreement I think obviously passed an important procedural hurdle yesterday and hopefully will be agreed on by the Senate today.\xc2\xa0 I think the House will take it up over the course of the next several days.\xc2\xa0 I think the Senate is likely to move to consideration of the ratification of the New START treaty, which is also a strong and important priority of the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a strong opinion about omnibus versus a continuing resolution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard back and forth on a bunch of different things, but obviously one of the things that has to be done before Congress leaves is how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay for the operation of government going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The omnibus I\xe2\x80\x99m told is 1,924 pages.\xc2\xa0 Do you worry that that could gum up things a bit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I just think it means a lot of people will be up late reading between now and, say, the 22nd or 23rd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who is going to read that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Burton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say -- I noticed during the health care debate that was a big thing.\xc2\xa0 And I assume many members up on Capitol Hill, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you really?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I take them at their word.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I take them at the word.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just so we understand the frame for the AfPak review, it was just a review of what\xe2\x80\x99s working or not working in the execution of the strategy?\xc2\xa0 You did not examine the strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, we -- absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we -- there was a comprehensive two-month review of where we are and what -- look, the President set out a series of goals in his West Point speech.\xc2\xa0 Are we making progress with this strategy on meeting those goals?\xc2\xa0 What is working?\xc2\xa0 What has to be refined?\xc2\xa0 What progress have we made?\xc2\xa0 What challenges persist?\xc2\xa0 And how do we address those challenges?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the question at the beginning of this review was, is this the right strategy after all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because it felt like administration officials were downplaying whether or not this was a review on the order of what we saw last year when they were looking at should we do counterinsurgency or should we do counterterrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, this was not a -- this was a two-month review process that worked through the interagency.\xc2\xa0 You saw the list of people at the meeting today representing a healthy side of both the military and the civilian component of our government.\xc2\xa0 And everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s got an equity in or a project in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and in dealing with al Qaeda and counterterrorism was represented.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere weren\xe2\x80\x99t 13 three-hour meetings with the President because -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the President had these meetings last year, ending -- or culminating in the announcement of the strategy in the speech at West Point.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt would be -- it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be accurate to presume that somehow two months ago somebody said, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see where we are.\xc2\xa0 The President receives on a weekly basis extensive memos from military and civilian -- military leaders in Afghanistan and civilian counterparts in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn a monthly basis, as happened today, the policy is evaluated in a room that has about -- probably close to two dozen agency and departmental heads that have the equity in that policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a policy that is examined on a weekly basis and then in a group with a monthly basis.\xc2\xa0 So the notion somehow that not two months ago, Tom Donilon and a group of others said, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s see how that December thing is going, would be I think an inaccurate viewpoint of how we got to this stage in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at the same time --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think it would be somewhat irresponsible for laying out how things are done in a conflict the size of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wonder -- I mean, at the same time, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it would be kind of absurd to continually re-litigate, do we have the right strategy, do we have the right strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- but, again, those types of questions are asked on a weekly basis and evaluated on a weekly basis in those memos and certainly on a monthly basis in these meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tLord knows if somebody had said in February of last year, this thing is way off the rails, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have continued until the process started in October to evaluate -- I just -- that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve dedicated the hard work and the effort and in some -- in all too many tragic ways, the full devotion of men and women in our armed forces not to take an honest and clear-eyed look at this approach every single day that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That seems to contradict, though, what a senior administration official told us just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is diagnostic, not prescriptive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Sam, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that this is a process that happens every week and every month.\xc2\xa0 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the notion somehow again -- as I was telling Savannah, the notion somehow that the President had a series of 12 or 13, I forget the exact number of three- or two-and-an-half hour meetings, and we just now have, over the course of two months, evaluated where we are, would be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think this is -- we did not set down two months ago and say, okay, is this working?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that every day since the President enumerated his policy.\xc2\xa0 We wanted an evaluation as to where we were on the goals that the President had laid out, where were we on the implementation and time of achieving those goals laid on top of Lisbon, which just set forth NATO\xe2\x80\x99s policy that in 2011 we\xe2\x80\x99re going to begin to -- beginning of 2011 begin to transition security for regions and areas in Afghanistan to Afghan control, concluding with their control at the end of 2014, and evaluating the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and what needs to be looked at and where we are.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, again, the notion, again, that -- and maybe we were wrong in saying this last December, the December review was not to start in October or November to see whether we had been -- we were on the right path 10 months ago.\xc2\xa0 That would be -- I think that would be to ignore the efforts of, as I said, people that give their last and full devotion to keeping all of us safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think where I\xe2\x80\x99m confused is -- I mean, is it -- you seem to be telling Savannah that what\xe2\x80\x99s still being litigated is whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s the right strategy, not whether or not the strategy is working.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, this is -- throughout the course of the year, in every meeting that the President has with David Petraeus and Karl Eikenberry, and it was Anne Patterson, our new ambassador in Pakistan, this is -- the notion somehow that we have gotten this far in, and somebody said, hey, this thing is way off track -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why there are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why a weekly report, a monthly meeting is put in.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we go through whether -- for instance, are we meeting the recruitment, training and retention goals of a security force that comprises an army and a police, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a graph that\xe2\x80\x99s given out each time that shows on the present course, are we going to meet the goals that we set forth at the beginning of this process for having in place an army and a police representing a security force that allows us to meet the goals and transfer security.\xc2\xa0 Are we doing that?\xc2\xa0 How many did we recruit last month?\xc2\xa0 How many stayed?\xc2\xa0 How many got trained?\xc2\xa0 What are they doing?\xc2\xa0 Where are they?\xc2\xa0 Are we on, again, a course to meet that?\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s done in a constant thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tJonathan.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, the START treaty is probably going to be coming up actually -- might actually be coming up tonight, but the debate will really begin tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 What is the President doing to make sure that that comes -- gets 67 votes?\xc2\xa0 And some Republicans are talking about moving to strike the non-binding missile defense language out of the preamble of the treaty.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you see the treaty text as inviolable or would you entertain changes to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with NSC on the language.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that when people like James Baker and others say that this is a treaty that will not affect our ability to conduct missile defense, probably there\xe2\x80\x99s no better example than at a meeting in Lisbon by NATO, where many encouraged the ratification -- the Senate to ratify this treaty.\xc2\xa0 We also finally got -- we finally went from the theoretical to the reality of a missile defense shield for Europe that also protects America.\xc2\xa0 So I think the notion that somehow those were in contradiction of each other were in many ways addressed them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has tasked the Vice President specifically with -- and the Vice President has, over the course of many weeks, been making calls and visits to the Senate.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that if you look at the number of Democrats and Republicans that have said they\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of this treaty, that number is at or exceeds 67.<br/>\n\tAnd certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s crucial and important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the number we need and that\xe2\x80\x99s the number that we expect to exceed when this is passed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid said today that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take care of whatever they can towards the beginning of next week, then go home and then come back for more votes between Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 Would the President cut short his holiday for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that statement.\xc2\xa0 So let me check with folks on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, on the CEO summit tomorrow, of the names that we --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can I just say -- I want to say -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll say this for like the 83rd time.\xc2\xa0 Whenever three or more people get into a room -- summits generally happen in Iceland, and involve trench coats and nice hats.\xc2\xa0 But this is a working group --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beer.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, I know.\xc2\xa0 Three people have a beer in the Rose Garden and all of a sudden there\xe2\x80\x99s like a cable Chyron of all this stuff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CEO working group --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, Roger.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excellent.\xc2\xa0 You go to the head of the class.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, yes, yes.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s probably somebody at Bloomberg right now scurrying to find different letters to plug in in lieu of \xe2\x80\x9csummit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of repeat CEOs:\xc2\xa0 GE, for example; Dow Chemical; PepsiCo.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see new faces there tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that -- I mean, look, this obviously is part of an ongoing discussion and working arrangement that the President has had with CEOs over the course of many months, whether we\xe2\x80\x99ve had them in for Roosevelt Room discussions, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s had them in for lunch or dinner.\xc2\xa0 I think some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest employers, many of them haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed their CEOs.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s some continuity to people that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll also see people that have also not spent a lot of time here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President wants to hear from them about what they see in the road ahead for the economy, and ideas that they have on continuing our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will he make any appeal -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cash sitting aside.\xc2\xa0 The President has mentioned it; you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned it.\xc2\xa0 Will he make an appeal to them to spend some of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will want to have a discussion about what steps -- I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s something like the business expensing or the research and experimentation tax credit continuity -- that are important certainty for business.\xc2\xa0 And the President will want to know, just as they\xe2\x80\x99ll want to know what steps we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to ensure that those tax credits are there, that what steps are they going to take as they see an economy get stronger and as demand picks up, how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to structure and invest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it morning or afternoon tomorrow or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he goes over in the morning, but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s over there for a bit of time tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and a related question.\xc2\xa0 He met with Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates today.\xc2\xa0 Part of the meeting was their program to get wealthy to give some of their wealth toward programs and such.\xc2\xa0 Did the three of them, by any chance, ask the President to do any pledging on his own?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the President -- well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that the President is not quite in --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not in their league, that\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- quite in the billionaires\xe2\x80\x99 league of what do you do with your money.\xc2\xa0 But obviously the President has -- I think the President would believe strongly and I think you can see from the donations that he\xe2\x80\x99s made on an annual basis that -- certainly for those that have been blessed, that ensuring the opportunity of those -- ensuring the opportunity of others is important to him.\xc2\xa0 And clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s what brought the Gateses and Warren Buffett here today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he be willing to consider such a pledge at some point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s, like I said, quite at the income club that -- of those other two.\xc2\xa0 But I know that his charitable donations are something that are tremendously important to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss the tax debate at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not had an opportunity to talk with the President after the meeting.\xc2\xa0 He went pretty quickly into the Afghan review, and I have not had a chance to talk to him about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just another question about the CEO working group meeting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s working.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s working.\xc2\xa0 See, you got us --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good thing is the Chyron makers at NPR will not have to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re invisible at NPR, which is so great.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you talked about trade as something that you thought was an area of agreement.\xc2\xa0 But there must be a whole list of things that you see coming up in the year, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s tax reform, deficit reduction, infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, could you talk about other areas where you think that the relationship will be different than the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of -- and, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to -- and the President will have more to say on this before he goes tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I think, as you mention, there are a whole host of important economic ideas and important things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President talk about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would point you to the speech that he did a little more than a week ago in North Carolina, as an important marker for what he sees this country has to be involved in in order to create opportunities for people here at home and how obviously that is directly related to businesses and employers.\xc2\xa0 We are not going to see a sustained economic recovery until we see that it is sparked and led by the private sector.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think whether that is -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, again, some of this over the past couple of weeks, whether it is agreement on a free trade agreement that will open up important developing -- either developing markets or fast-growing markets for our products and creating jobs here at home; whether it is an investment in a sufficient infrastructure for the 21st century; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s education reform.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of things I think that the President is interested in both talking to and hearing from CEOs on this tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked before about why so much cash, why they\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on so much cash, even though their profits are going up.\xc2\xa0 And you said, in answer to Roger\xe2\x80\x99s question, that you seem to accept the argument that it was about certainty, that they were sitting on the cash because they were --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 My answer was to say I think while they\xe2\x80\x99re going to say they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for certainty in certain things like expensing, which was something that the President -- look, consumer demand is what drives economic growth, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what drives decisions on whether or not -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to sell you something, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to make more of them if I think the demand is greater for you to sell them.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t accept the argument that, oh, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- businesses aren\xe2\x80\x99t investing because they don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the tax structure is going to be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- it is helpful to -- like, take business expensing, right?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re taking a policy that would spread the writing off of some fixed percentage over a 10-year period of time.\xc2\xa0 I think putting that in a one-year period of time the President believes will have a stimulative effect on their investment strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in the end, the economy grows because of consumer demand, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where a lot of these decisions will derive from.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one of the things that was really interesting about last year\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan strategy review was the liveliness of the debate.\xc2\xa0 The President made a point about wanting to look at all different sides of each issue.\xc2\xa0 Has this year\xe2\x80\x99s review been characterized by a similar type of debate?\xc2\xa0 Are there fault lines?\xc2\xa0 Is there disagreement at all about what the problem is and what the solution is and what\xe2\x80\x99s working and what\xe2\x80\x99s not working?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, look, again, last year\xe2\x80\x99s extensive review, which lead to strategic decisions and strategic implementation of -- particularly increased troops on the ground, I think that led to, as you said, a spirited conversation about the direction that we should go.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis year, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve evaluated that, I think the President is -- and the team are comfortable with the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve picked, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re implementing that strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, any given meeting could still have some liveliness, and obviously there are still strongly held opinions.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s pretty broad agreement on where we\xe2\x80\x99re heading and what the challenges are.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why I started this by saying I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a lot in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s review that you find that surprising.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and the challenges that remain are well known.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m a little confused.\xc2\xa0 So you had said that this -- excuse me, this view is ongoing or has been ongoing; it\xe2\x80\x99s a continuation.\xc2\xa0 So what separates this two-month review with what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on all the time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m being the one that\xe2\x80\x99s confusing.\xc2\xa0 This is to evaluate where we are, okay?\xc2\xa0 Each month and each week, we evaluate whether the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99re implementing is making the progress toward the goals that the President enumerated.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, the point I was also trying to make was, it is not as if we had this extensive decision-making period that led or culminated in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech at West Point, only to now come back nine months later and see is it working.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s being evaluated constantly.\xc2\xa0 And now this is a pretty extensive look into evaluating what the President said a year later and the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, what remains -- what has to -- what larger questions do we have drill down even further on?\xc2\xa0 And how do we evaluate -- I mean, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an evaluation period that actually extends back farther than the strategic review that led to the policy decisions last year.\xc2\xa0 And that is a whole host of years of our policy in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 We note that China\xe2\x80\x99s Vice President -- Vice Premier Wang is visiting the NSC Advisor Donilon this afternoon in the White House.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us some detail about their meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too deep into what might be said before the meeting, but I think it is clear that -- I mean, obviously we have invited the Chinese to -- for a state visit in January.\xc2\xa0 So obviously that is something that is always on the docket.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have developments obviously in North Korea that you see Deputy Secretary of State Steinberg and NSC Senior Director Jeff Bader traveling to China to discuss.\xc2\xa0 So I think a whole host of foreign policy and economic concerns will be on the docket.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the state visit date be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to announce that in the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s sense of the dynamics in the House as the tax legislation would move over there?\xc2\xa0 He sounded more optimistic when he came in here last night after the Senate vote.\xc2\xa0 And is it still the case that you in no way want that package opened up and changed in any way so that it would have to go back to the Senate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the framework that -- the framework that the President introduced a little more than week ago has, as you heard others say, has been changed to add the energy tax credits that were important to the President and a number of Democrats.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the Senate is going to pass that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the basis of which the House takes up that legislation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we think it\xe2\x80\x99s also the basis for what will become the agreement that the President will sign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to say that the President, as you heard, have -- and said at this podium just yesterday, understands the frustration that members have in not being able to simply extend the tax cuts permanently for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes to do that in the Senate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what led us to need to come up with something that didn\xe2\x80\x99t impact middle-class Americans with a tax increase on the 1st of January.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the vote look now in the House?\xc2\xa0 Is the President still reaching out individually to members?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to make calls.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes -- look, I think if you look at the -- look at events over the past 48 hours, 85 I think was the final number in the Senate last night -- 83-15.\xc2\xa0 I knew there was a five in there somewhere.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have done well in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Price Is Right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tThe 83 votes, I think, if you look at a number of public opinion polls that have come out, demonstrate broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President believes that in the not-too-distant future we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an agreement that he can sign that preserves those tax rates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he can afford to lose a few Democrats and still find a wide enough margin to pass it in the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think so, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Ambassador Holbrooke\xe2\x80\x99s frame of reference for the AfPak situation was Vietnam.\xc2\xa0 He was extraordinarily concerned with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Do you think, in his absence, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s inclination to pick someone who is more skeptical, someone who sort of matches --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Glenn, I got to tell you, I think there has not been a lot of time spent in the very few hours since Richard passed thinking about who\xe2\x80\x99s next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in this meeting, because clearly he prepped -- he had done some preparation for this meeting, did any of this --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, Ambassador Holbrooke.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, sure.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he obviously was -- I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Richard was instrumental in the development of the policy that the President laid out a year ago and has been a big player in this every step of the way, both in the development and the implementation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did anyone express any of his opinions or observations that he may have collected prior to his passing?\xc2\xa0 Was he sort of represented in the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, look, I think -- again, I think the challenges that we have are well known and well documented to you and to the many people from a policy-making perspective that are in that room, Secretary Clinton, certainly foremost among them, from the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve just -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time here working through who will occupy that position next.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the larger issue isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily about personnel.\xc2\xa0 The larger issue is you described a process today that seems to have gone fairly harmoniously.\xc2\xa0 And you can say many things about Ambassador Holbrooke, but harmony was not his first priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 Look, Glenn, don\xe2\x80\x99t misunderstand me.\xc2\xa0 Harmony is not what has led all of these meetings or it\xe2\x80\x99s not the intended outcome.\xc2\xa0 The intended outcome is to get the policy right.\xc2\xa0 If one has to break a few eggs in order to make the omelet, people get that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s happened certainly at every step of the way, and I think -- you mentioned Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Pakistan was a long point of discussion in the meeting today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any doubt that Richard\xe2\x80\x99s views were well represented on that score.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I had a few brief questions about the Thursday review.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how many pages it would be?\xc2\xa0 Can you rule out there will be a call for -- or that the President would call for sending any additional troops to Afghanistan or anyone else as a result of the policy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The document does not call for any additional force changes.\xc2\xa0 I think the document, as I said, will show that we\xe2\x80\x99re on track for July 2011.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President asked for some changes in the document today, so in terms of the number of pages, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be -- there\xe2\x80\x99s two version of this.\xc2\xa0 There will be an executive summary that we\xe2\x80\x99ll put out publicly, and then obviously there is a top secret and classified version that has been constructed as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the al Qaeda part of the strategy, beyond dealing with Pakistan and Afghanistan, will it deal with AQAP, will it deal with Yemen, and can you give us some foreshadow of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Again, our focus on this was -- best I -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check, but I think this is focused only on Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then are we looking beyond the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on Thursday at any kind of a speech that\xe2\x80\x99s remotely akin to West Point where he broadly and in-depth addresses the American people about a year after the speech?\xc2\xa0 Or did he basically do that in Afghanistan when he was there last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think -- I mean, look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that how the public views our efforts I think anyone would admit to you is important in the overall effort in these two countries.\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President lay out extensively his thoughts on where we are.\xc2\xa0 And then, as I said, some of the senior policymakers will be in here to take some of your questions around that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that there will be a West Point-type speech, but I think an extensive discussion of where we are is certainly what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting gears, tax cuts are not the only thing that expire on December 31st.\xc2\xa0 The Build America Bonds program does as well.\xc2\xa0 Over the summer, the National Conference of Mayors and League of Cities have said it\xe2\x80\x99s so essential to them that in its absence they\xe2\x80\x99re now warning of potentially up to half a million layoffs at the state and local level, and withdrawing these subsidies for municipal bonds, but they\xe2\x80\x99re really concerned of the impact of that.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House fight more for the extension of the Build America Bonds program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have -- there are a lot of things that the President wanted to see that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in this agreement.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Build America Bonds and other things are things that the President believes are important.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously -- I think there are obviously -- there are a series of budgetary concerns that -- at a state and local level that I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure all of that is a result of -- or could be remedied with Build America Bonds.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s an important investment that the President and the team put in the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And, look, there are things that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see extended that just aren\xe2\x80\x99t in this agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If states like Illinois and California that are particularly in dire straits came with their tin cup in hand, would the White House agree to -- is there another bailout for the states in the works?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99d consider?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that there has been a bailout for the states that was previous to your question today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, through these subsidies, which are, in effect --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think investing in infrastructure is -- maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m misunderstanding the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think paying down on a municipal rate for a bond to invest in infrastructure is a bailout.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s how we build schools.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that when we build schools we consider that a bailout.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to clarify one thing, you mentioned senior officials perhaps coming in the Briefing Room?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you mentioned perhaps the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 Is that the plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is -- or that was, schedule permitting.\xc2\xa0 And I have not double-checked on that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That is my hope.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another scheduling item, the President is meeting the CEOs tomorrow --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I keep saying tomorrow, don\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xc2\xa0 Thursday, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thursday, Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara got me so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but tomorrow he is meeting --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s AfPak summit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the CEOs --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Come on, come on, guys.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been like 45 minutes, but come on, that was pretty good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, on Friday, he is meeting Friday afternoon with a group of labor leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a summit?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what that meeting is about and who will be attending?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that a summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It is part of the ongoing effort, as I said yesterday; the CEO meeting is part of it; meeting with economists that represent the left and the right of the political spectrum last week.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99re heading into an important year in our economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to hear from a series of different perspectives on what their ideas are.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, as you said, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see labor leaders on Friday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see CEOs on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen economists over the past week.\xc2\xa0 And I think it all gives the President and the economic team here a full understanding and a candid discussion of the ideas that are available and where they see the economy heading.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 Most people believe that START would pass early next year, even if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t taken up this year.\xc2\xa0 Why prioritize -- why is the White House prioritizing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that the argument inside of here has necessarily tracked the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, you actually don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that it would pass next year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know this, the President would like to, because we -- more than 67, the number needed for ratification, have said this year that they support it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you\xe2\x80\x99d put off until next year what the President believes we can get done this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question.\xc2\xa0 The Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Amos, has spoken out a couple times out of the context of hearings where his opinion is asked for -- within a congressional hearing, that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing.\xc2\xa0 But just off the cuff to reporters again today spoke about lifting the ban being too distracting.\xc2\xa0 And he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose any Marines to distraction.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have any Marines that I\xe2\x80\x99m visiting at Bethesda with no legs.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried about -- sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 I thought I was about to get hit by something.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a little technical glitch over there.\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried about having the Commandant of the Marine Corps, who is his appointee, sort of constantly raising opposition to his own stated belief that the policy needs to be changed and would actually increase national security, not decrease it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 views and the Secretary of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s views are fairly well known.\xc2\xa0 I think the President, as the Commander-in-Chief, has a strong viewpoint, I think backed up by the survey conducted by the Pentagon as to the attitude of the men and women in our military, that this can be done in a way that strengthens our national security, preserves the best fighting force in the world, and most importantly does away with a policy that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think is just.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President -- I mean, look, the President met with --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he worried about the Commandant?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the Commandant is continually challenging the assumptions of the Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, look, I think their views have been -- I think their views are very well known, just as the Commander-in-Chief\xe2\x80\x99s views are very well known.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the Commander-in-Chief, the head of the Pentagon, and the head of the -- the Chair of the Joint Chiefs, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find unanimity in the belief that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to do away with this policy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what the President is working to do.\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s also important is the Senate has clearly taken the views of all of these players into account, and last week, as I said, well north of a majority of those people said it was time to end this policy.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Tommy and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go here and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll head back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I just have one question and one follow-up from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 First, does the White House have any reaction to reports of conflicts of interest regarding the judge who struck down the health care law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, say the first part again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to reports of conflicts of interest regarding the judge who struck --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction particularly on that.\xc2\xa0 I think if you -- look, there was a lot of commentary on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to get a couple of points of perspective.\xc2\xa0 Eleven cases challenging the constitutionality of some portion of the health care bill have been dismissed.\xc2\xa0 Two federal courts have actually upheld the constitutionality of the very provision that another court ruled differently on yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, 115 miles apart, two judges in the same commonwealth came to different conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think if you take a -- if you really look at the ruling, the thing that I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by is quite honestly the narrowness of the ruling based on the petition that the Attorney General made.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General -- and I think to be clear, the Attorney General wanted the entire piece of legislation, based on proving what he thought was one segment of the bill unconstitutional, that the whole bill would be struck down.\xc2\xa0 The judge actually, despite a lack of a severability clause in the larger legislation, severed his ruling on the mandate away from the rest of the legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe practical impact -- because the only thing the judge dealt with was one aspect of the legislation to be implemented in 2014 -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no practical impact at all as states move forward in implementing the decision -- or implementing the law that Congress passed and the President signed.\xc2\xa0 So I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it could have been worse.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the fact that it could have been worse means the conflict of interest is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have, Tommy, anything with me on what you asked me about the conflict.\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by is less that it could have been worse, but just how narrow it was.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we talked a little bit about this yesterday, but a lot of coverage happened for just two weeks -- not a lot of coverage happened for something two weeks ago where the -- where a judge in a different district in the same commonwealth ruled and upheld the constitutionality of the very same provision that a judge ruled differently on yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I think that means is that this is -- some aspect of this is going to wind its way through the legal process as states move forward and as the judge explicitly let the states move forward on dealing with the law that Congress passed.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion somehow that there\xe2\x80\x99s some historic crack in this is not held up by what the judge actually ruled on.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I just wanted to follow on the Haiti question from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Did you get --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody looking.\xc2\xa0 I think -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, I think what Senator Leahy, as head of the foreign operations -- I think foreign operations subcommittee for appropriations, was discussing something about -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve evaluated the election.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right behind you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- thanks a lot, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just returning to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 In the last six months, the President has lost his top U.S. commander in Afghanistan with the resignation of General McChrystal, and now with the passing of Ambassador Holbrooke, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost his top U.S. envoy to the country.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted you to weigh in on how big these losses are to the war effort.\xc2\xa0 Or in your view and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, is the war effort strategy for dealing with Afghanistan bigger than any one person?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than any one person.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Richard had, as I said earlier, a set of experiences that made him crucial and important to this effort.\xc2\xa0 General McChrystal has been replaced by General Petraeus.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to see how that has negatively impacted the effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously we miss his presence today, and we will no doubt miss his presence in the future.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secretary of State, his staff that remains, and many of the ambassadors that he has come into contact with and some of whom he has shaped over his five decades in diplomatic service will help lead the effort to continue to make progress on the civilian side and to make progress on Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:24 P.M.
