EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here aboard Air Force One as we make this exciting trip to Cooperstown, New York and the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>\n<p>As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re heading to the Baseball Hall of Fame to discuss the new steps we are taking to welcome international visitors to the United States and to highlight the job growth and other economic benefits generated by this increased travel and tourism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, earlier today, the President met with several CEOs and executives from leading travel and tourism companies.\xc2\xa0 And as a part of this Year of Action, the President is urging the power of his -- is using, rather, the power of his pen and phone, whenever he can and wherever he can, on behalf of the American people to create jobs and help hardworking Americans get ahead.</p>\n<p>Today, the President signed a presidential memorandum to expedite the entry process for travelers, starting with the 15 largest airports.\xc2\xa0 We also are taking additional steps to improve and streamline the entry process, including expanding the use of technology to streamline the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s repetitive -- including expanding the use of technology to streamline the entry process, such as Automated Passport Control kiosks.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, we are launching new efforts to encourage travelers to visit the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This builds on the National Travel and Tourism Strategy in 2012 the President launched.\xc2\xa0 He set an ambitious goal of attracting and welcoming 100 million international visitors annually by the end of 2021.\xc2\xa0 Two years later, we are on track to meet this goal, in part due to the actions taken by the President and the administration to expand our ability to attract and welcome visitors while maintaining the highest security standards.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, was it a coup in Thailand?\xc2\xa0 And what does that mean for the United States if it was?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as you heard Secretary Kerry say, the United States is disappointed by the decision of the Thai military to suspend the constitution and take control of the government after a long period of political turmoil.\xc2\xa0 And there is no justification for this military coup.\xc2\xa0 We are also very concerned by reports that senior political leaders of Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s major parties have been detained, and we call for their release.\xc2\xa0 And we are concerned that media outlets have been shut down.</p>\n<p>The U.S. urges the restoration of civilian government immediately, a return to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as press freedoms.\xc2\xa0 The path forward for Thailand must include early elections that reflect the will of the people.\xc2\xa0 While we value our long friendship with the Thai people, this act will have negative implications for the U.S.-Thai relationship, especially for our relationship with the Thai military.\xc2\xa0 We are reviewing our military and other assistance and engagements consistent with U.S. law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does U.S. law require the United States to take certain actions or withdraw certain benefits that we provide Thailand?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is the United States initiating those actions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re reviewing the assistance and engagements that we have with and for Thailand, consistent with U.S. law.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have answers yet in terms of the effect of this development in Thailand on those programs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have any U.S. officials been in touch with military leaders over there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department, where Secretary Kerry has addressed this.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of -- well, I can tell you that we are working to maintain contact with the civilian government and to deliver the message that there is no excuse for a military coup.\xc2\xa0 We\'re concerned by reports that senior political leaders have been detained, and we call for their release.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a little bit more about Chad?\xc2\xa0 If you could give us some more details about that decision -- when it was made, why it was made, what you think you can do now to help those Nigerian girls.\xc2\xa0 And also, are there any other steps other than that that the U.S. is contemplating?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The presence of U.S. personnel in Chad is related specifically to the use of unmanned surveillance vehicles as part of the effort to conduct reconnaissance missions in search of the missing or abducted Nigerian girls.\xc2\xa0 As we notified Congress yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed 80 U.S. military personnel to Chad in support of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s search for the girls, and that\'s in addition to the disciplinary team we already have in place at our embassy and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance support we have already been providing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Specifically, the team in Chad is there to support one of our -- in support of one of our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance assets -- ISR assets -- an unarmed, unmanned aerial vehicle supporting the search for the girls.\xc2\xa0 As our colleagues at the Pentagon said yesterday, roughly half of the team consists of maintenance and support personnel; the other half provides security for that team.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>More broadly, the search for the girls is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 The Nigerians, of course, remain in the lead and we continue to lend our unique assets and capabilities to assist the search.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll continue to evaluate what additional resources we might bring to bear in support, in close consultation with the Nigerian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There may be additional steps, but none that you\'re prepared to announce at this time?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are none to announce at this time.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve obviously stood up an interdisciplinary team based out of our embassy, and we have the personnel in Chad who are there in support of the unmanned, unarmed aerial vehicle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you able to take us at all behind the scenes on that decision in terms of whether there were leaders of other countries you consulted with or any other officials?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask State and DOD, specifically. But again, this is consistent -- this is the implementation of what we said we were going to do, which is provide unique assets, including personnel, in assistance -- as part of our assistance to the Nigerian government as they search for the abducted girls.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve already talked about the fact that we have both manned and unmanned aircraft involved in the search, and these personnel are there to support one of the unmanned, unarmed aircraft.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- has generated any leads or new information yet?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of any new information as to the whereabouts of the girls.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to talk about Ukraine really quickly.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you mentioned there was some troop movement.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen any -- is there any updates or anything to report on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We still have not seen anything conclusive.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some movement, but it is not yet --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Moving away?\xc2\xa0 Moving closer?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the movement is not definitive enough to say that it represents a withdrawal of any kind.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that President Putin and the Defense Secretary are true to their word and that this is the beginning of a withdrawal of Russian troops from the Ukrainian border.\xc2\xa0 The presence of those many, many troops has clearly had an effect on the stability of Ukraine and has at the very least caused intimidation and tension in the relations between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>So we monitor very closely the situation on the border and hope that Russia follows through on its promise, or its announcement, that it would be withdrawing those troops.\xc2\xa0 And we also urge Russia to use its influence with separatists in eastern Ukraine to get them to cease their efforts aimed at undermining the upcoming elections, cease their engagement in violence and intimidation and occupation of official buildings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have any sense of timing in terms of the elections this weekend and how quickly you guys would be able to assess how those elections went and then make a determination on sectoral sanctions?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that something that can happen on Sunday?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that takes a week to figure out, or something in between?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it depends, of course, on how the process unfolds.\xc2\xa0 There will be international observers in most parts of the country, as I understand it, organized by the OSCE.\xc2\xa0 And the OSCE continues to report good progress in the preparations for balloting across the country.\xc2\xa0 And most of the country, of course, is calm, and we expect that election -- that the balloting on election day will be able to proceed effectively and peacefully and freely.</p>\n<p>We obviously have concerns about the efforts by separatists to disrupt the ability of Ukrainians to engage in free and fair elections in Luhansk and Donetsk and those regions of eastern Ukraine, and we call on Russia to use its influence on the separatists to get them to cease in that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of how soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll know, it just depends on how it goes.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think OCSE may have a better sense of what their expectations are, but much of it depends on what takes place on election day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have an assessment now of how things are shaping up in terms of the potential for a fair election?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the disruptions by the separatists.\xc2\xa0 How disruptive are they?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 As I think I mentioned the other day, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that most of the country remains calm and that a smooth election process should be able to take place.</p>\n<p>We do have concerns about the efforts to undermine the electoral process in eastern Ukraine, especially in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that it is certainly possible, and there are precedents for it, to see Ukraine carry out free and fair elections even if there are pockets of the country where there is violence or there are successful efforts to prevent people from voting and having a free and fair election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reports of election offices raided, ballots taken, and the like.\xc2\xa0 And again, if Russia were serious about wanting to use its influence on separatists to allow for a free and fair election, we believe they could do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The House passed the Defense Authorization bill today.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House threatening to veto that because of the Gitmo restrictions in it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on VA, could you talk about just two brief things?\xc2\xa0 One, is there any more light you can shed on how the White House views the VA Accountability Act and what discussions you\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the Senate Democratic leadership in terms of whether they would bring that up?</p>\n<p>And also, when the President said that Rob Nabors\xe2\x80\x99s report would happen next month, can you give us a little more information on when next month he expects to get that comprehensive review?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would only point you to what the President said in terms of the timing of Rob\xe2\x80\x99s more comprehensive review and his expectation that Rob will have it for him next month.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the issue of the legislation, the administration shares and supports the goals of the bill, ensuring accountability at the VA.\xc2\xa0 We do have some concerns that some provisions could result in significant litigation, which would defer valuable time and resources from VA\xe2\x80\x99s accountability efforts and its core mission of delivering quality services to our veterans.</p>\n<p>But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear we want to work with Congress on specific language issues and look forward to discussing the bill going forward.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that the President has also directed Secretary Shinseki to make sure that the VA is making maximum use of its existing authorities and looking at whether the VA needs any additional tools in this area.\xc2\xa0 I think the President made clear that not only -- that if there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of misconduct, if individuals are engaged in misconduct, and there is evidence of that established, that he wants to see folks suffer consequences for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, has the U.S. formally asked China to turn over the five military officials that were charged with cyber espionage earlier this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the specifics of that conversation I think I would refer you to Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to Justice, and they\'re not saying --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what I talked about earlier when the announcements were made is that consistent with routine practice when individuals, foreign nationals in foreign countries are charged with crimes in U.S. courts, we as a routine matter seek the assistance of the foreign government.\xc2\xa0 But the specifics of that conversation and that communication are not available to me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing on the VA.\xc2\xa0 Next week, when he goes to West Point, do we expect him to talk about the situation with the vets at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commencement address at West Point at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect he will?\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has used those to make -- no, I mean he\xe2\x80\x99s used those to set policy or shape our view of policy going forward in the past.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, I just don\'t have a preview of those remarks.\xc2\xa0 I would note since we\xe2\x80\x99re now -- you\xe2\x80\x99re now asking me when is the next time he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about the VA, that it has been 24 hours since he spoke about the VA.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Actually, that\'s not what I was asking you.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But it is essentially the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Her question was if there\xe2\x80\x99s a broader policy --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use the commencement speech to make policy, not on the VA.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said when I answered the question moments ago, I don\'t have a preview of the speech.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you fly to Chicago, can you talk us through that a little bit, what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do, besides the fundraisers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has a couple -- I just said he has a couple of events for -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if they\'re -- which committee, I think DCCC.\xc2\xa0 I can find out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
