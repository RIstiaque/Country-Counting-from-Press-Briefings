Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:58 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Happy Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Before I go to your questions, I did want to echo an announcement that was made from Paris earlier today, I believe.\xc2\xa0 The United States welcomes the announcement today from President Hollande that France will conduct airstrikes in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This is a significant contribution to the efforts of the growing international coalition to combat ISIL, and we look forward to coordinating closely with our French partners in the days to come.</p>\n<p>So given the interest that there has been in our efforts to build this growing coalition, I thought I would note that at the top.\xc2\xa0 But with that, Darlene, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions, if you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to get us started.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm reports that are out there that the U.S. will provide $46 million in military assistance to the Ukrainian military?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did read an Associated Press report on that topic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good source.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you must have a good source.\xc2\xa0 President Obama is looking forward to his meeting with President Poroshenko in the Oval Office shortly.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to hear from both of them about the discussion that they have today.\xc2\xa0 The visit is an opportunity to highlight the United States\xe2\x80\x99 firm commitment to stand with Ukraine as it pursues liberal democracy, stability and prosperity.</p>\n<p>The two Presidents will be discussing efforts to pursue a diplomatic resolution to the crisis in eastern Ukraine, as well as our continued support for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s struggle to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have announced that $53 million in new security and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, which brings our assistance to approximately $291 million this year.\xc2\xa0 That is in addition to a $1 billion loan guarantee that was announced earlier this year, as well.</p>\n<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s new package of assistance includes more than $7 million to be directed to international relief organizations to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 It also includes $46 million in security assistance that will support Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s military and border guards.\xc2\xa0 This is in addition to the $70 million in security assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously announced in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>All of this is a reflection of the support from the United States for the people of Ukraine as they seek to determine the future of their country that reflects their will.\xc2\xa0 It also reflects our commitment to standing with the people of Ukraine as they confront this incursion on their territorial integrity and their sovereignty, and on their efforts to build a strong democracy and a strong economy for their people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, President Poroshenko was here today.\xc2\xa0 He addressed Congress.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s asking for lethal aid.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is not yet ready to provide what he\xe2\x80\x99s asking for.\xc2\xa0 Is some of the resistance to providing lethal aid, does that have to do with the cease-fire and perhaps wanting to see how long that will hold before you make a decision on whether to give Ukraine any sort of weapons?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I should point out that the security assistance that we are providing today does include the kind of valuable equipment that will be useful to the Ukrainian military.\xc2\xa0 It includes things like body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision goggles and other devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios.\xc2\xa0 It also includes counter-mortar radar equipment that could provide for the protection of Ukrainian forces and provide warning of incoming artillery fire.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about some sophisticated military equipment that would be useful to the Ukrainian military and to their security forces.</p>\n<p>The President, I believe as recently as just a couple of weeks ago, was asked about the possibility of providing lethal assistance to the Ukrainian military.\xc2\xa0 In the context of that answer, the President did talk about the strong ties between the U.S. military and the Ukrainian military and our commitment to supporting them.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we believe that the best way to resolve the differences between the Ukrainian government and the Russian-backed separatists is for the Russian government to use their influence with the separatists to encourage them to engage in legitimate negotiations with the central government to try to resolve their differences, and to do that in a way that reflects a commitment to genuine negotiations.</p>\n<p>We believe that is the path of resolving this situation in the most enduring way.\xc2\xa0 It also is the way that is clearly in the best interests of those Ukrainians right now who are living in a conflict zone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just switch to another topic.\xc2\xa0 General Dempsey told the Associated Press earlier today in an interview that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take at least three months to begin training and arming moderate Syrian rebels, and eight months to a year to field a cohesive fighting group.\xc2\xa0 That seems like a long time.\xc2\xa0 Can any of that be done sooner?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would have the best information about how the Title 10 authority that we are hopeful that Congress will pass today will be executed in pursuit of this mission to ramp up our assistance and training to Syrian opposition fighters.</p>\n<p>As you know, Darlene, the United States has been providing assistance to the Syrian opposition, including some military assistance, for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 So there is assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s already been provided that is already strengthening the Syrian opposition forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President does believe, however, that additional assistance should be provided so that those Syrian opposition fighters can be in a position to take the fight on the ground to ISIL in their country.\xc2\xa0 This is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination that it would not be in the national security interests of the United States to put American boots on the ground in Syria in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll be -- someone, however, needs to be responsible, as our military planners have said publicly -- needs to be responsible for taking the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the United States is taking an active role in ramping up the assistance that we provide to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 Those Syrian opposition fighters will have the backing of an international coalition of countries who are prepared to offer military support in the air in support of their ground operations.</p>\n<p>So we are optimistic that by implementing some of these changes that we can improve the capacity of the Syrian opposition fighters.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the President believes that these Syrian opposition fighters need to be responsible for taking the fight to ISIL in Syria.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If President Poroshenko is asking for heavy weapons, why not simply give it to him?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about Russian retaliation or something?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Steve, it\'s simply the judgment of the President that the best way for us to resolve -- or for the situation in Ukraine to be resolved is through negotiations between the Ukrainian central government and the Russian-backed separatists in the east.\xc2\xa0 When asked this question in the past, the President has recognized, or has acknowledged that it would be challenging to provide all of the military equipment necessary to try to level the playing field between the Ukrainian military and separatists that have the backing of the rather sophisticated Russian military.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our strategy of supporting Ukraine has been somewhat different, which is to provide them some economic and diplomatic assistance, and enough military assistance that they can sort of bring both sides to the negotiating table to try to resolve their differences through negotiation, as opposed to on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the French contribution.\xc2\xa0 Is that the only other country besides the United States joining in airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Steve, as I\'ve mentioned a couple of times in the past, the announcements of commitments of members of this broader international coalition will largely come from those countries.\xc2\xa0 That is the way that those commitments will have the most credibility.\xc2\xa0 And after all, it\'s the decision of the leaders of these countries to make about what sort of contribution they can dedicate to this broader international effort.</p>\n<p>The President did, however, yesterday in his remarks talk about some of the commitments that we\'ve received and have already been carried out.\xc2\xa0 There are more than 40 countries so far that have offered assistance to the broad campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The United Kingdom and France have been flying over Iraq with us for some time.\xc2\xa0 France, in particular, has some sophisticated intelligence and surveillance capability that has already been put to good use in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And the French President today announced that France was prepared to take the next step of actually carrying out airstrikes in Iraq.</p>\n<p>This is in addition to other commitments that we\'ve received.\xc2\xa0 Both Australia and Canada have indicated that they are willing to send military advisers to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 German paratroopers have committed to participating in some of the training efforts that we\'ve been talking about.\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia announced in the last couple of weeks that they would be in a position to host at least some of the training operations that would ramp up the capacity of the Syrian opposition fighters.</p>\n<p>So what starts to emerge there is a pretty good picture of the kind of broad international support that exists for this strategy to degrade and ultimately defeat -- destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, the President sent out a tweet last night about keeping the U.K. together.\xc2\xa0 What are his concerns about Scottish independence?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President was trying to make clear in the form of that tweet, as he did in his previous comments on this topic, is to make clear that this vote is one that should rightly be decided by the people of Scotland, and they should cast a ballot in support of what they think is best for their country.\xc2\xa0 The President, speaking as the President of the United States, talked about his belief that the United Kingdom is a robust, strong, united partner, and we want to keep them that way.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m a little confused about the lethal versus non-lethal aid to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 In the past, a senior administration official told us that there was a worry on the part of the U.S. of working this kind of a proxy war against Russia.\xc2\xa0 Is that still the concern?\xc2\xa0 Or what really is the point of helping the Ukrainians militarily but only up to the point of lethal aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do have an interest in making sure, Michelle, that the Ukrainian military isn\'t overrun by the separatists.\xc2\xa0 The separatists have access to rather sophisticated military equipment because, as we have said on numerous occasions, the Russian military is actively supporting their efforts.\xc2\xa0 NATO has produced photographic evidence of this, despite the denials -- the hard-to-believe denials of Russian military and political leaders.</p>\n<p>So the fact is Russian separatists are obtaining sophisticated military equipment from the Russians, and we want to make sure that the Ukrainian military doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get overrun.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, this is a conflict that will not be satisfactorily resolved on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity for these differences to be resolved around the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where they should be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And the Ukrainian government will have the support of the international community as they try to engage these Russian-backed separatists in conversations.</p>\n<p>What we will do and what we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do is call on the Russians to use their influence with the separatists to encourage them to engage constructively in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Russia\xe2\x80\x99s failure to do that will put them at risk of sustaining even more economic costs that could be imposed by the international community.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s time for Russia to play a constructive role in this process.\xc2\xa0 And the failure to do so has already led to significant economic costs being imposed on the Russian people and on the Russian economy.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in all this time, including since the cease-fire, have you seen any step at all by Russia to do that, to use their influence to deescalate it?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been some indications that the Russians have taken some steps that are consistent with supporting the cease-fire agreement that was reached a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 But we have seen, as we have in the past, some mixed signals from Russia on this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so while there are some signs to be optimistic about the direction that this is headed, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot more work to be done to implement the cease-fire agreement, to convene the kind of negotiations that will ultimately resolve the differences between the Ukrainian central government and the separatists in the east.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re still seeing troops massed at the border?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense and other places about what sort of -- what the latest assessment is of the situation at the border and what the latest assessment is of Russian military involvement in this conflict.<br/>\n\tBut what we have seen is a pattern of Russia continuing to allow weapons and materiel to be transported across the border from Russia into Ukraine and into the hands of Russian-backed separatists.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s still happening.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, for the latest assessment, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But what we have consistently seen is -- since the cease-fire agreement, we have seen the conflict deescalate; that there are indications that the cease-fire is taking hold.\xc2\xa0 But there have been sporadic exchanges of fire that indicate that there is still some work to be done to implement the cease-fire agreement.\xc2\xa0 And then the cease-fire agreement, of course, would not be the end here; that would rather be the beginning, because that would hopefully, once the cease-fire was in place, open the door to the kinds of negotiations that would actually resolve the broader differences between the government and the separatists.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 And you still don\xe2\x80\x99t see this as an invasion?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because what we have seen for several months now is the kind of activity in Ukraine by the Russians that blatantly violates the territorial integrity of that country.\xc2\xa0 There is an international norm at stake here, which is that sovereign governments respect the borders of other sovereign governments.\xc2\xa0 And Russia has acted in a way inconsistent with that international norm, and as a result, the international community has spoken with one voice and taken steps to impose economic costs on Russia for the failure to uphold those basic international norms.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not an invasion?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, Michelle, is activity by the Russians that flagrantly violates the territorial integrity of the sovereign nation of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And the international community has taken action to impose costs on Russia for that flagrant violation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Justin.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two things I wanted to ask about.\xc2\xa0 My first one was on ISIS.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be have been like a bit of a messaging cleanup this week coming out of the White House -- whether it was Secretary Kerry on whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with them; Secretary Kerry about whether we were communicating with the Assad regime; General Dempsey on whether ground troops were a theoretical possibility or not; or Admiral Kirby on whether you really needed the authorizations to do this train-and-equip program.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve heard statements that you\xe2\x80\x99ve then had to clarify or walk back, or however you want to characterize it.\xc2\xa0 And so what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is, if all these represent sort of differences of opinion within the President\xe2\x80\x99s team that are sort of manifesting themselves as people ask questions about them, or if they\'re just instances of a big, sprawling bureaucracy and not all being on the same talking points.<br/>\n\tAnd if it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re worried at all that that\'s going to erode support, as it seems to have a little bit this last week for the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to address ISIS.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that, Justin.\xc2\xa0 One is something that I said before, which is that I am confident that the senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team are on the same page as the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And I feel so confident in saying that -- that if you doubt that, that I would encourage you or your colleagues to check specifically with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they would confirm for you that they are exactly on the same page as the Commander-in-Chief.<br/>\n\tAs it relates to some of the instances that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, the thing that we have said for quite some time is that these are complicated, complex issues, and that the President feels a strong commitment to ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re communicating clearly with the American public and with our allies about what our policy is and about what our policy isn\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\tAnd it is appropriate for you and your colleagues to closely scrutinize the comments of me and other -- and the senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team when they\'re doing interviews or when they\'re testifying before Congress.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome that scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 And I think what sometimes that scrutiny lends itself to is a dissection of words to sort of probe the deeper meaning.\xc2\xa0 And when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about complicated issues, it\xe2\x80\x99s natural for people to raise additional questions about those comments.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I have said -- throughout the instances that you have cited -- is that the comments of Chairman Dempsey in the hearing, and Secretary Kerry in other settings, is completely consistent with the policy that has been laid out by the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 That continues to be true today.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then I wanted to ask about DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in the context of the Politico story that came out.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I read it.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Harry Reid said today that the future for the chairwoman is kind of up to the President.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering from you -- since the article seemed to express some disenchantment at the White House with the chairwoman -- is whether you guys remain confident in her, and whether you expect her to serve as DNC chairwoman throughout the rest of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I did read in the story the on-the-record statement from my colleague Mr. Schultz here, expressing his full support for the work of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the chair of the DNC, and frankly, for all of the staff over at the DNC.\xc2\xa0 They have very difficult work, and that is work that they do outside of the limelight but it produces important results for the Democratic Party.\xc2\xa0 And the President is invested in their success and the broader success of the Democratic Party.<br/>\n\tChairwoman Wasserman Schultz has a pretty strong record of performance to indicate the benefits of the tireless work that she\xe2\x80\x99s been engaged in over the last four years or so that she\xe2\x80\x99s been the chair of the party.\xc2\xa0 Over the last 20 months, she\xe2\x80\x99s traveled to 37 states and 99 different cities -- just one more, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the triple digits.\xc2\xa0 Under her leadership, the DNC has expanded their digital and technology staff, who are providing campaigns of all sizes, cutting-edge tools that the Obama campaign used to great success in 2012.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnder her leadership, the DNC launched the voter expansion project earlier this year, and they have voter expansion directors in dozens of key states, including places like Georgia, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire and others.\xc2\xa0 She also has been hard at work working closely with the finance staff at the DNC to pay off debt that the DNC incurred in the context of the 2012 elections.\xc2\xa0 The DNC incurred that debt to assist Democratic candidates up and down the ballot in all 50 states.\xc2\xa0 President Obama benefited from those efforts as well.<br/>\n\tSo he certainly has been pleased to see the DNC succeed in paying off their debt.\xc2\xa0 And I now I understand they\xe2\x80\x99re operating at a six- or seven-million dollar surplus.\xc2\xa0 So that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen by accident; it happens because of the dogged determination of Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz and the rest of the staff at the DNC, like I said, that does really good work outside of the spotlight.\xc2\xa0 And they don\xe2\x80\x99t get the credit they often deserve.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the story, she said that she planned to stay in the position until January 2017.\xc2\xa0 Since she has expressed that desire, do you guys expect her to be the chairwoman of the party until then?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, she is -- her term does run through 2017.\xc2\xa0 She was elected by the membership of the DNC, and I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate at this point any reason to change that.<br/>\n\tJared.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re responding to some of the in-the-administration and current members\xe2\x80\x99 reaction about ISIS.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could respond to Retired General Mattis\xe2\x80\x99s testimony yesterday about specifically not taking things off the table and saying that this is a forecasting -- the President has talked a lot about hammers and nails.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned at all about putting away the hammer and letting the nails do what they will?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I have answered a version of this question before, but let me take another shot at it.<br/>\n\tLet me start by saying I did not see General Mattis\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to react to him directly.\xc2\xa0 But I can react to the contention that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised about sort of the wisdom of taking things off the table when it comes to our military strategy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe one thing that the President has taken off the table is deploying American military personnel on the ground in Iraq and Syria to serve in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe, as he mentioned in his remarks to the men and women at MacDill Air Force Base yesterday, he does not believe it is in the national security interest of the United States for us to get dragged back into a ground war in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 That means you will not see columns of American tanks rolling through Iraq with the goal of taking and holding territory in Iraq.<br/>\n\tIf there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over the course of the last decade is that providing for the security of the nation of Iraq is not something that the United States can do alone.\xc2\xa0 For all of the tremendous capacity and bravery of our men and women in uniform, they should not be in a position where they are providing security in Iraq for large segments of Iraqi territory for the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 This is work that the Iraqis must do for themselves.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the lynchpin of this strategy was the formation of an inclusive government in Baghdad that could unite the diverse elements of the nation of Iraq to confront the ISIL threat.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are gratified that Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders have taken the important step of forming this inclusive government.\xc2\xa0 We hope that they will continue to live up to their promise to govern in an inclusive way and make sure that every Iraqi citizen all across that country feels like the central government in Baghdad is looking out for their best interests.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe believe that will have a corresponding impact -- a positive impact -- on the capacity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to fight for and defend that entire country.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that that is the right strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the reason the President has been clear about that is, first, he believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be transparent with the American public -- as transparent as possible -- about what our strategy is and what our strategy isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important for the Iraqis to understand that the American military is not going to swoop in and save them.<br/>\n\tThe American military and the American people are ready to support the Iraqi people as they take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their country.\xc2\xa0 They can count on being backed up, as they have been for the last couple of months, by American military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 They can count on the support of the broader international coalition that the President is building. As I mentioned, President Hollande has indicated a willingness to order the French military to carry out airstrikes in Iraq, too; that will be done in close coordination with the broader international coalition and in support of the effort by Iraqi security forces on the ground in Iraq.<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the American people to understand what our strategy is and what our strategy isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important for the Iraqi people and Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to understand what our strategy is and our strategy isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 This will make it clear to them that they need to step up and take responsibility for the security situation in their own country.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic -- and you got a version of this earlier -- but is there anything -- where are the discussions in the administration at this point about the possibility of recognizing an independent Scotland?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand that the vote is actually going on right now.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll let that vote be concluded before we start delving into the policy implications of either a \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d vote or a \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d vote.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Military contingencies, economic contingencies, treaty contingencies -- are these being discussed now?\xc2\xa0 Or are you waiting until after the vote?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If necessary, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about this after the vote.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just a couple of follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 First, on the Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to be clear -- does the President have complete confidence in Debbie Wasserman Schultz as the DNC chair?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I ran through her track record --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- just the fundamental -- we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the nut graph.\xc2\xa0 Does he have confidence in her as chairman?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes -- based on the strong track record of leadership that she has already demonstrated at the DNC, the President has strong confidence in her ability to lead that organization.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And back to the campaign operation, whatever you want to call it, against ISIS -- why does the President never use the word \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d when describing this?\xc2\xa0 I know we had some back-and-forth here, and you eventually used it, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard it -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m correct, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him say this is a war.\xc2\xa0 Does he consider it a war?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, yes -- based on the position that I have clearly articulated, that the United States, in the same way that we are at war with al Qaeda and their affiliates all around the globe, we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But when I say \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the broader international coalition and the international community that\xe2\x80\x99s being led by the United States is at war with ISIL.<br/>\n\tWhat the President, when he is describing what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing there, is trying to do a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first, obviously, is to be very clear about what our intentions are and what our intentions aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The second is, the President has gone to great lengths to try to describe to you and to the American public that the counterterrorism strategy that we are pursuing in Iraq and in Syria is consistent with the counterterrorism strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve used successfully in other places.\xc2\xa0 This is a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s predicated on building up governments, building up the capacity of local forces, backing them up with American military might where necessary to take the fight to extremist organizations on the ground and deny them a safe haven.<br/>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also clear is that this strategy is significantly different than the war that was fought in Iraq earlier in the previous administration principally.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand, too -- that, again, we do not envision a scenario where there is a long column of American tanks rolling across the Iraqi border with the goal of taking and occupying significant swaths of Iraqi territory.\xc2\xa0 So I think the effort that you are picking up on is an effort to try to differentiate the strategy that the President is employing in this situation from the strategy that was employed earlier this decade in Iraq.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when the President says there will be no ground troops, there will be no combat troops in Iraq, is that what he means -- we won\xe2\x80\x99t see columns of American tanks going through Iraq to occupy territory?\xc2\xa0 Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear anybody actually proposing that.\xc2\xa0 Is that his definition?\xc2\xa0 Is that where the line is drawn?\xc2\xa0 So we won\xe2\x80\x99t have columns of American tanks and ground troops trying to take over swaths of territory in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Is that what he\xe2\x80\x99s ruling out?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very clear about what he\xe2\x80\x99s ruled out, so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check his remarks on this topic.<br/>\n\tWhat the President has said is that he is not going to put U.S. military personnel on the ground, in Iraq, in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 That means a variety of things, but that is the guideline that the President has laid out.\xc2\xa0 It certainly means that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be long columns of American tanks rolling across the Iraqi desert trying to take and occupy Iraqi territory.\xc2\xa0 It also means --<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.\xc2\xa0 It also means that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put American military personnel in a situation where they are responsible for personally and directly engaging the enemy in combat.\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that they will be there in an advise-and-assist role, and there are a variety of ways they can do that.\xc2\xa0 They can do that by serving in the joint operation center and coordinating the efforts of Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, and integrating them with the broader coalition forces.\xc2\xa0 There might also be a scenario where American military personnel -- again, in an advisory capacity -- could be forward-deployed with Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 They would be forward-deployed to offer some tactical advice, maybe call in some airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 But again, they would not be in a position where their specific responsibility was to personally or directly engage the enemy in combat.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m getting at.\xc2\xa0 So the President is not ruling out having U.S. troops based with Iraqi forces on the front lines -- based with Iraqi forces, embedded with Iraqi forces that are engaged in combat?\xc2\xa0 He does not rule out having Americans serving side-by-side with Iraqis in such a position?\xc2\xa0 Forward-deployed, as you said.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to describe what I just said, but you\xe2\x80\x99re using different words in doing that.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of trying to understand what our position is, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to what I just said.\xc2\xa0 And I say that only because -- not because I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be argumentative, but only because you and your colleagues are rightly holding us to a high semantic standard.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of trying to understand what I said, I just tried to lay that out.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on this high semantic standard, these would be heavily armed American troops.\xc2\xa0 They would be on the front lines; they would be in the line of fire.\xc2\xa0 But their purpose would be to advice the Iraqis and to call in airstrikes, but they would be right in the thick of it, no?\xc2\xa0 And the President is not ruling that out.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President -- well, let me take this in a couple of different forms.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there have been -- the President has ordered additional military personnel to Iraq over the course of the summer, and there have been War Powers notifications filed as it relates to those military deployments.\xc2\xa0 Each of those War Powers notifications indicated that those troops are combat-ready, that they are armed for combat because they need to protect themselves.\xc2\xa0 Iraq is a very dangerous place right now.<br/>\n\tSecond is, there are already American military personnel that are in the line of fire.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re pilots -- they\xe2\x80\x99re piloting aircraft, carrying out airstrikes against ISIL positions in Iraq.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the point is -- and the President made this point in his remarks at MacDill yesterday -- that each of these missions carries with them a risk, and no one should minimize the risk that our men and women in uniform are taking on in support of this mission.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t minimize that risk.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just last thing on this high semantic standard -- so these would troops, they would be serving on the ground.\xc2\xa0 These would be troops, wearing boots I assume.\xc2\xa0 They would be combat-ready.\xc2\xa0 And they would be in the line of fire.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying -- how are you not considering these troops that are combat troops?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jon, in a variety of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is that they\xe2\x80\x99re not responsible for going in and occupying large swaths of Iraqi territory.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position where -- we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not talking about 140,000 or 150,000 of them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about their principal responsibility being to directly and personally engage the enemy in combat.\xc2\xa0 They are not in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in an advise-and-assist role that, yes, that does carry with it some risk.\xc2\xa0 But it is different than the combat role that American troops were engaged in for such a long time in Iraq.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 On the French airstrikes, is the United States government disappointed that the French, according to President Hollande, apparently ruled out airstrikes in Syria, and said that the airstrikes -- they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to participate in Iraq only.\xc2\xa0 And second, has the United States government seen this new video that was released by ISIS today?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that video?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me take your second question first.\xc2\xa0 I have not personally seen the video.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports about the video.\xc2\xa0 Our intelligence community is reviewing that video for any information that they can glean that might be useful.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing that video in coordination with our British allies as well.\xc2\xa0 But for any additional information or questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the U.K. government on that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the French announcement today, we were gratified to see President Hollande step up and indicate France\xe2\x80\x99s role to assume some of the burden or carrying out airstrikes in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 As we continue to broaden in a systematic way that military campaign against ISIL, including hitting targets in Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be in touch with the members of this international coalition as we embark on this effort.<br/>\n\tBut this will be an ongoing process, and the announcement from the French today is an important one, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to join the U.S. in carrying out some of these airstrikes in Iraq.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to my colleagues -- I mean, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there, obviously -- but to my colleagues who were at the press conference, he specifically said that these will be limited to Iraq and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going into Syria.\xc2\xa0 So this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just an omission of he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say; he specifically said we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be participating in.\xc2\xa0 So is there a sense that the United States government could convince the French to go further at some point in the future?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to speak for the commander-in-chief of the French military for what steps the French military is prepared to take.\xc2\xa0 But the effort to build this coalition is an ongoing one, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult with our allies and partners about what role they can play to contribute to this broader international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.<br/>\n\tMara.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 You said it\xe2\x80\x99s in your interest in making sure that the Ukrainian military doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get overrun.\xc2\xa0 Is that your description of the current state of the military conflict in Ukraine -- that they are not being overrun?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a military analyst, but I do think that based on my basic understanding of the situation on the ground there, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any evidence that they have been overrun, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve described that as kind of a satisfactory state.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the Ukrainian government thinks --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I used that word.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I said it that way.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so this isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- so the current military situation is not satisfactory to you -- to the administration?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what would be satisfactory to the United States is the full implementation of the cease-fire agreement and the beginning of negotiations that would eventually resolve differences between the Ukrainian central got and the separatists.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But Poroshenko clearly feels that his current military situation is untenable without lethal military aid from the U.S. -- more than night goggles.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that lethal military aid is not necessary to achieve the goal of getting a diplomatic solution.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out why, since you have a difference of opinion between the White House and the Ukrainian government.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend it this way, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe our military assistance to the Ukrainians as just \xe2\x80\x9cnight goggles.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I mean, over the course of this year --<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, non-lethal aid.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about $100 million in security assistance -- more than $100 million have been provided to them.\xc2\xa0 This includes body armor, helmets, vehicles, night and thermal vision devices, heavy engineering equipment, advanced radios, demining equipment, portable explosive ordnance disposal robots, patrol boats, rations, tents, counter-mortar radars.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A bunch of stuff.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So a bunch of stuff.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my point -- that our assistance that we have provided to the Ukrainian military is extensive.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that that assistance and the new stuff you\xe2\x80\x99re giving them now is going to create a situation that will get Russia to do what you want it to do at the negotiating table -- you know, come and negotiate the cease-fire?\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that this assistance is going to do the trick?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we believe is that it is clearly in the interests of the international community for nations all around the globe to respect the basic territorial integrity of other nations.\xc2\xa0 This is a --<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing that.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a critically important international norm.\xc2\xa0 And the United States, in conjunction with our partners in Europe, have taken significant action to impose costs on Russia for their failure to observe that basic international norm.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they haven\'t just failed to observe it; they have flagrantly violated it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as long as Russia continues to violate that norm, they will put themselves at risk of being further isolated and sustaining further costs to their economy.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, it will be the decision of President Putin to decide what is in the best interest of Russia.\xc2\xa0 But right now, for the instability that they\xe2\x80\x99re fomenting in this region of the world, their economy has taken a hit.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not a big enough hit to get them to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 I have one last question.\xc2\xa0 There is a model for this --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me say one thing about that.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s the separatists who should be at the negotiating table with the Ukrainian central government.\xc2\xa0 But I understand your point.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, they -- Russia --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but I understand your point.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a model for this, which is in Georgia and Moldova, where the Bush administration have a certain amount of aid to these countries but not enough to prevent what\xe2\x80\x99s called a frozen conflict -- where Russia just destabilizes them enough that they don\xe2\x80\x99t control other territory and they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take over these countries lock, stock and barrel, they just need to keep them in this frozen conflict state.\xc2\xa0 Is that the model for what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing with Ukraine -- Georgia and Moldova?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, what we would like to see in Ukraine is Ukraine be able to make the kinds of decisions that reflect the will of the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we can do that in a way that reflects the strong ties that already exist between Ukraine and Russia, and that strengthening Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s ties with the West through the signing of association agreements and other strong ties should in no way have an impact on the ability of Ukraine to have a strong and fruitful relationship with Russia as well.<br/>\n\tCheryl.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Next week, the President is going to be attending the U.N. Climate Summit, but the top leaders of China and India are not going to be attending.\xc2\xa0 Have you had to lower your expectations for that summit because of that?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say about the activities at the United Nations possibly as early as tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But we are looking forward to this meeting.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get done in New York next week, and some of it will involve bringing along the international community in terms of coordinating in an effort to reduce the causes of climate change and of carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more on that next week.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate the fact that the heads of state of those two countries not being there will have any impact on our ability to advance the ball on this priority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJerome.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking in front of Congress, President Poroshenko just asked explicitly the United States to grant Ukraine the special security status as a non-NATO ally.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States ready to grant Ukraine the status?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that specific request, Jerome, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.<br/>\n\tRoger.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on the airstrike decisions, the options the President is considering?\xc2\xa0 Has he gotten them?\xc2\xa0 And also, what kind of role will he play in the airstrikes?\xc2\xa0 Will he give the military a long leash or a short leash?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s probably not an analogy that I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat.<br/>\n\tLet me say it this way:\xc2\xa0 The President did have a briefing with his top military leaders at CENTCOM yesterday at MacDill Air Force Base.\xc2\xa0 The President described that briefing as thorough.\xc2\xa0 He was pleased with the work that has been done by his military planners as they develop options and plans related to his order that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to broaden out military action in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 They would broaden out this military operation in a way that would further our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But as I mentioned with Jon and others, that would not include putting American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria to carry out a combat role.<br/>\n\tBut this is part of an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0 And the update that the President received at CENTCOM was useful, and it did reflect a lot of work that has been going on for quite some time at the Pentagon, but that work is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about decisions that the Commander-in-Chief has made at this point.<br/>\n\tAs it relates to what sort of ongoing communication will exist between the Commander-in-Chief and the military as they carry out this campaign, what I would say is that the -- what we have seen so far in Iraq over the course of the last month or so is an indication that the President is prepared to lay out guidelines for his military planners and his military commanders who can then carry out the actions that they believe are necessary within the confines of those guidelines.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat Chairman Dempsey referred to at one point during his testimony earlier this week was the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to review certain elements of that plan on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 What Chairman Dempsey was referring to was this question that Jon and I were discussing, which is the possible forward deployment of American military advisers with Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 Again, Chairman Dempsey did not raise the prospect that those American military personnel would be in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 They would not because the President would not approve that.</p>\n<p>What the President would consider, however, is the forward deployment of these -- of this personnel, of these advisers to offer tactical assistance to Iraqi security forces and if necessary call in airstrikes in support of their ground operations.\xc2\xa0 So that is something that the President said that he wanted to reserve the option of considering those requests on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>But more generally, the President has laid out for his military commanders clear guidelines for executing the mission that he has ordered.\xc2\xa0 And the military is carrying out these operations within the guidelines of what the President has ordered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no airstrike decisions yet, and we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect them to be imminent?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- right, in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was trying to decide whether you were talking about the Iraq thing or Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have indicated that we are -- that the President is ready to order additional -- or ready to order airstrikes in Syria at a time and place of his choosing.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to be in a position of telegraphing those plans in advance at this point.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to pinpoint that, because the Journal says this morning that the President wants to be in the position to authorize each and every run in Syria once he orders it.\xc2\xa0 True or not true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is that not true?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because what the President has done in Iraq and what he will do in Syria is lay out clear guidelines for what the President envisions for our military planning, and he will authorize -- put in place guidelines that the military can use to carry out these operations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President communicate that yesterday at MacDill, say that that -- once I give you the guidelines you\xe2\x80\x99re free to go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\'t want to characterize the conversations between the President and his military planners, but let me just say that this is consistent with the air campaign that the military has been conducting in Iraq, that there are more than 160 airstrikes that have been carried in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President did not sign off on each of those 160 airstrikes individually; rather he presented guidelines --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he won\xe2\x80\x99t in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about something that we reported this morning about a threat that I\xe2\x80\x99m curious if the President has been briefed on, and to what degree he is knowledgeable about it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a group that is related to al Qaeda called Khorasan.\xc2\xa0 And we have reported that in dozens of airports, U.S.-bound passengers are undergoing enhanced screening.\xc2\xa0 Security agents are looking for hidden explosives, uncharged laptops and phones are banned from flights because this particular group is trying to create an even more sophisticated way to smuggle explosives on planes.\xc2\xa0 And this could be a more immediate threat than what is currently dominating a tremendous amount of policy and headlines, meaning ISIL or ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about what the President knows about this, the degree to which his counterterrorism officials are on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me about an intelligence issue, obviously, so there is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m limited in what I can say.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is that our intelligence professionals have long spoken about the host of terror threats that are emanating from Syria.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard me discuss quite a bit about the challenges posed by foreign terrorist fighters.\xc2\xa0 And next week you will hear directly from the President when he chairs a U.N. Security Council session on this very topic.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to provide granular detail from here about specific threats or potential cells that may be operating and seeking to carry out attacks against American interests.\xc2\xa0 Frankly, doing so would be counterproductive to our whole-of-government approach to countering this challenge.</p>\n<p>Let me just add to that by saying generally that the Obama administration and our law enforcement and national security professionals remain vigilant about threats that are emanating from Syria and other places around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And this requires the constant evaluation of our security posture.\xc2\xa0 It often will require the tweaking of our security posture to change certain elements in a way that would strengthen our defenses in one area.</p>\n<p>And sometimes these changes to our homeland security posture are pretty evident to the traveling public, and sometimes they aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But we remain vigilant about the threats that continue to emanate from al Qaeda and their affiliates all around the globe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to get back to Poroshenko for a moment, because he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t keep the peace with blankets, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t win the war with blankets.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Understanding that you believe the United States is providing more than blankets, there are prominent members of the Democratic Senate, Carl Levin chief among them, who urge the President and this White House to provide lethal arms.\xc2\xa0 Is that something you are ruling out permanently?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for a substantial national security decision like that, I\xe2\x80\x99d let the President made that decision.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to do that from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have provided substantial security assistance to the Ukrainian military, and that reflects our commitment to the Ukrainian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on the table but just slightly.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the characterization of whether or not this is something we might do in the future -- ruling out that we would do something like this in the future would be something that the President would do, not me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to telegraph when airstrikes will start, but in an open forum today, Secretary Hagel did tell the House, I believe it was, that he and General Dempsey have approved Syrian airstrike plans, and they were presented to the President yesterday down in Tampa.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did review in a briefing with his military planners at CENTCOM some of the plans that they have developed as it relates to the order that he has said he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to issue to broaden our airstrike campaign into Syria to deny a safe haven to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It is a core principle of this presidency to ensure -- to actively deny a safe haven to those individuals or organizations that seek to do harm to the United States or our homeland.</p>\n<p>So this is something that our military planners at the Pentagon have been hard at work on for quite some time now.\xc2\xa0 The President described the briefing that he received from them as thorough.\xc2\xa0 He was pleased with the solid work that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing.\xc2\xa0 I did not sit in on -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say this in a way that leads you to believe that I sat in on the briefing.\xc2\xa0 I did not.\xc2\xa0 I did have the opportunity to speak to the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it has to come up the chain of command, I guess is the point; that Secretary Hagel, General Dempsey, top two military advisors, have at least approved airstrike plans, they say, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of characterizing what the Secretary or the Chairman has signed off on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What I can tell you is that the President was pleased to have the opportunity to review the hard work that\xe2\x80\x99s been underway at the Pentagon for quite some time, and to consider those detailed plans that were put forward before him.\xc2\xa0 And he was pleased with their work, but their work is ongoing and continues.\xc2\xa0 The other work that they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in is building this broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President had the opportunity to meet with his senior national representatives of other governments who are co-located with CENTCOM.\xc2\xa0 These governments are some of the regional governments that could potentially contribute to a broader international coalition.</p>\n<p>So I just raise that to make sure that everybody understands that CENTCOM is not just responsible for doing this kind of military planning and presenting options to the President.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also actively engaged in the effort to coordinate with regional governments about the role that they could play in a broader international coalition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just want to go back to Darlene\xe2\x80\x99s question at the beginning about sequencing in terms of Syria and airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 When General Dempsey tells the AP that it could take at least<br/>\n\tthree months to train the Syrian rebels, can airstrikes move forward in Syria before the rebels are trained, since the President -- a key part of his strategy is United States airstrikes coupled with the rebels being the ground troops to fight ISIS on the ground?\xc2\xa0 Can you do one without the other?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would -- I think the short answer to that is yes, because the President has announced his intention to take -- to broaden out the military airstrikes \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He can start it and then --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, in a way that would succeed in degrading the ability of ISIL to -- well, degrading the capacity of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So that can be done by ordering airstrikes on the front end before there is a fully trained and equipped security force on the ground to take the fight to them.\xc2\xa0 But what we\'ve been clear about for quite some time now, and as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from our military planners, it will require boots on the ground to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That is the way that we can ensure that we are effective in denying them a safe haven in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the use of American and allied military airstrikes would have an effect, even a substantial effect, on degrading the capacity of ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On boots on the ground, how does the President, how do you react, when his former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates says you can\'t win, you can\'t destroy ISIS without having U.S. combat troops on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s consistent with what I just said -- it is going to require combat boots on the ground to take the fight to ISIL in Iraq and in Syria \xe2\x80\x93</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He suggested U.S., not just the Syrian rebels.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the entirety of his remarks.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that that\'s exactly what he was implying.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said the President is putting himself in a trap.\xc2\xa0 So it didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like he was saying count on the Syrian rebels.\xc2\xa0 He said the President is headed for a trap.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is a basic strategy that the President has laid out and it does include boots on the ground.\xc2\xa0 The question is whose boots on the ground is it going to be.\xc2\xa0 They are not going to be U.S. boots on the ground engaged in combat operations in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>What we can do, and what the President believes we should do, is ramp up the assistance that we provide to Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, ramp up the assistance that we provide to the Syrian opposition so that they can take the fight on the ground to ISIL in their own countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last one on that point -- in your exchange with Jon, if U.S. troops are forward deployed, as you say, alongside Iraqi troops, giving them tactical guidance, and these U.S. troops are fired upon by ISIS, are the U.S. troops to do nothing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 U.S. troops will have rules of engagement; they always do when they enter a situation like this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what would those be?\xc2\xa0 Will they fire back at them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not going to detail those rules of engagement.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense can do that for you.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the Commander-in-Chief would expect that the American troops do what is necessary to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 That would be \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re defending themselves and they\xe2\x80\x99re firing back they\xe2\x80\x99re in combat.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, as I described earlier, the principal responsibility of these American troops would not be to personally or directly engage the enemy in combat --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the principal responsibility, but they could be drawn into combat.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not how I would describe it.\xc2\xa0 This is another, I think, useful data point.\xc2\xa0 The strategy that the President laid out, this counterterrorism strategy that involves on occasion the forward deployment of some military personnel who are not engaged in combat operations is consistent with the counterterrorism strategy that we\'ve used in other places.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground and they\xe2\x80\x99re in a combat zone.\xc2\xa0 Or are you saying they\xe2\x80\x99re in some other area?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it will depend on exactly what the scenario is, exactly how far --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then how do you know -- if they\xe2\x80\x99re not in combat if you have to figure out what the scenario is.\xc2\xa0 The question is more if you have the Iraqi soldiers there fighting ISIS, who the President has called these awful terrorists, and they\xe2\x80\x99re firing upon them, that sounds like a combat zone that U.S. troops are in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Iraq is a very dangerous place and American military personnel will have the equipment they need to defend themselves.\xc2\xa0 But what their role will be -- and this is what\xe2\x80\x99s real important for people to understand -- their role will not be to roll across the border in a long line of tanks to occupy significant territory in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Their role will be to provide advice and assistance to Iraqi security forces who are taking the fight on the ground against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that could mean being on the ground in forward-deployed locations to call in airstrikes \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not their role, of course, but when you\'re in a combat zone, your role can change, right?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that what General Dempsey is suggesting?\xc2\xa0 Your role can change.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the environment in which you\'re operating can change.\xc2\xa0 But their role specifically would be to offer advice and assistance to the Iraqi security forces who are taking the fight on the ground to ISIL.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to what General Dempsey said about the timeline and the three-to-four months to begin this training program and then a year perhaps to get them ready to actually be ready for action.\xc2\xa0 In terms of these troops who are American troops, combat ready but not combat troops, and the threat to the region, threat to the United States that the President expressed when he gave his remarks, in this interim year, given how key they are to his strategy, does the threat to all of them, including those U.S. troops, escalate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, there are already a number of things that we can do to try to address the situation.\xc2\xa0 The first is we already have for over a year been providing assistance, military and non-military assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 So there already is a relationship that exists between the U.S. and some of these groups that are fighting ISIL in Syria.</p>\n<p>I think what Chairman Dempsey again was referring to was \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But over that period of time we\'ve seen their gangs grow, their strength grow, their cash reserves grow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have also seen and I think what we\'ll continue to see in the months ahead as the relationship between the opposition fighters and the United States becomes solidified, as they get additional equipment, as they get additional training, as they get additional experience fighting ISIL, I do anticipate that we will see their performance improve.\xc2\xa0 I would also anticipate that as ISIL forces are subjected to American military or allied airstrikes in Syria, that that will degrade their capacity and performance on the battlefield as well.</p>\n<p>So I think the point here is that what the President envisions in this broadened, systematic air campaign is the deployment of American and allied air power to degrade ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That is going to have an impact on their ability to operate.\xc2\xa0 It will have an impact both in the context of their physical equipment being degraded.\xc2\xa0 It also will add another element that ISIL fighters need to be worried about.</p>\n<p>Right now, the reason that we are concerned about this situation is that ISIL is essentially operating in a virtual safe haven.\xc2\xa0 Once there are American warplanes and allied warplanes flying overhead, Syria, or at least that region in Syria, will no longer be a safe haven from which ISIL is able to freely operate and coordinate attacks in Iraq, and certainly would make it much harder for them to contemplate carrying out attacks against the United States homeland.</p>\n<p>Let me just reiterate that at this point our intelligence community assesses that we are not aware of any active plotting against the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0 But if we were to allow this safe haven to persist it\'s not hard to imagine that ISIL could, in fact, turn their attention to plotting against the U.S. homeland. That is why the President has ordered this broadened air campaign as part of this coordinated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, you said the President would welcome any show of support from Congress.\xc2\xa0 And the vote, as you know, from the House was 273 to 156, but 40 percent of Democrats opposed it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s expected to be a split, as well, in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is that the show of support that the White House was hoping for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, we certainly are very pleased to have seen a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats come together in the House of Representatives in support of a proposal that the President considers a top priority.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t happen very often these days in Washington, D.C., and we were pleased to see members of Congress put aside partisan labels and actually focus on this core priority.\xc2\xa0 There are Democrats and Republicans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Forty percent of the Democrats voting to oppose the President is the show of support that sends a message that there is a unified show of support?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that, again, a majority of Republicans and a majority of Democrats in a very divided House of Representatives is a strong show of support to the American people, to the international community, and to our enemies that the United States is determined to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That is an important show of support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And like I said, this is a testament to the willingness of members of Congress -- even those who voted against it -- to put aside their partisan labels, to carefully consider the proposal in front of them and vote their conscience.\xc2\xa0 And that is the responsibility of elected members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But in this case, I believe that they deserve credit for faithfully executing that responsibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to turn really quickly to phrase differently something that\'s already been asked about the meeting with President Poroshenko.\xc2\xa0 And I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to want to put words in the President\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.\xc2\xa0 But what does he say to him when he asks specifically for lethal aid?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the succinct argument for why the U.S. will not provide that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from the two Presidents about their meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to prejudge on the front end that that\'s something that President Poroshenko will directly raise himself in the Oval Office with the President.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from the two of them after their meeting, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a sense of what their discussion was like.</p>\n<p>Mr. Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So apparently ISIL has made military gains in the last 24-48 hours in northern Syria against Kurdish forces, in other words, non-Assad forces.\xc2\xa0 Are military gains like that, is that a concern to the White House?\xc2\xa0 Are they addressed under the President\xe2\x80\x99s new policy?\xc2\xa0 Is that a potential instigation or does it meet the threshold for airstrikes against ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I haven\'t seen those reports, but certainly the goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL -- would involve reducing their capacity to make military gains.</p>\n<p>So even in the short term -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- the President has been pretty clear that ultimately destroying ISIL is not a short-term proposition.\xc2\xa0 But what we do think that we can do in the relative near term is to have an impact on degrading the capacity of ISIL to launch military operations in Syria or in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That is, after all, the reason that the President has ordered this broadening of our military campaign.\xc2\xa0 It also would serve to deny them a safe haven.</p>\n<p>And so I guess to answer your question, again, without having seen the reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, the effort to degrade ISIL in the short term, we would expect would have the effect of reducing their capacity to make military gains.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On this forward deployment of advisors, would you characterize them as advisors that -- if they were potentially forwardly deploying, calling airstrikes, they\xe2\x80\x99re advisors, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has described these as military personnel in an advise-and-assist capacity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are now 1,600, give or take, American military personnel in Iraq in that capacity.\xc2\xa0 Is there an upper limit to that number?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if there were an upper limit to that number, the President would set it.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President does not envision anything even approaching the kind of sustained, on-the-ground military presence that was responsible for occupying Iraq a decade ago.\xc2\xa0 But what the President does envision are American military personnel working closely with Iraqi and Kurdish security forces, as they are now, to integrate the contributions of the international coalition and the ground defenses of the Iraqi and Kurdish security forces to take the fight to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s an important role that American military personnel are on the ground and already playing in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the Hill over the last few days is a lot of concern from members about the role of the neighboring states.\xc2\xa0 The President and other officials made a big deal about Arab nations joining the coalition.\xc2\xa0 Senator Corker, I think, yesterday called them potential \xe2\x80\x9ccoat holders.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t revealed the exact role that many of these nations are going to play.\xc2\xa0 Today, Secretary Hagel said the perception of this is not just an American enterprise is very important.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s a perception issue, when are you going to come forward with some specific information about what Arab nations are contributing to the coalition?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, the one thing that I would refer you to is I would refer you to the Jetta communique that came out last week, that there\xe2\x80\x99s some pretty stark language in it that indicates the commitment of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon to this broader effort.\xc2\xa0 They agreed to do their share in the comprehensive fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That includes stopping the flow of foreign fighters, countering the financing of ISIL, repudiating their hateful ideology, ending impunity and bringing perpetrators to justice, assisting with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of communities brutalized by ISIL, and, as appropriate, joining in the many aspects of the coordinated military campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that is a pretty strong declaration from some of these Arab countries of their support for this broader international coalition.\xc2\xa0 I guess my point is you don\'t have to take my word for it; you can look at the communique that they have signed their names to, to indicate their commitment to this broader international effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do one more.\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 House Democrats yesterday launched a discharge petition to compel a vote on the Employment Nondiscrimination Act.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support those efforts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I can tell you the President has long supported inclusive federal legislation to address employment discrimination against LGBT Americans, and we continue to believe that Congress needs to act.\xc2\xa0 We welcome efforts to move this issue forward, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll work with lawmakers and advocates to achieve this important goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Chris, that the President has acted using his executive authority to try to take some steps to end employment discrimination against LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 So this is clearly a principle that we support, and we welcome congressional action in this area.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The language associated with this version of ENDA has a narrower exemption along the lines of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\xc2\xa0 That\'s narrower than the language in the Senate-passed bill.\xc2\xa0 Does the President prefer the language in the version that\'s (inaudible) or wants the Senate-passed language?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do know that this is the subject of ongoing conversations between White House officials, senior administration officials, and interested members of Congress who have been focused on these issues.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to characterize those conversations at this point.\xc2\xa0 But this is, generally speaking, a value that the President supports and encourages Congress to act on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t you want to characterize those conversations right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because they\'re ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll let those conversations continue in private.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President will reach out to members of Congress to encourage them to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific calls to read out from the President at this point, but I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out conversations along those lines.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
