Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="rtecenter">*The President will deliver remarks on Veterans Day at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>\n<p class="rtecenter">**Director Mueller did not brief the President in person today on the ongoing investigation at Fort Hood.</p>\n<p class="rtecenter">\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">1:20 P.M. EST</p>\n<p class="rteleft"><br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before we get going on questions I just want to reiterate again that -- I think most of you know that we\'ll be doing a briefing call on Asia, on the Asia trip.\xc2\xa0 I think as most of you all know, based on the events of last week and the changes to the President\'s schedule this week, our departure to Japan will be delayed by a day.\xc2\xa0 We head to Japan, spend the same amount of time there, one fewer days in Singapore, and then pick up as previously scheduled.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">In terms of why, obviously the President had a fairly full schedule tomorrow, which, as you all know, has been changed to go to Fort Hood for the memorial service, where the President will speak and see victims\' families.\xc2\xa0 So as I said, late last week before we tried to do a week ahead that the schedule was in some flux, and that is largely how it has come out now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you go through the week ahead now?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, what was on the schedule tomorrow that he\'s doing Wednesday?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know exactly what got moved around.\xc2\xa0 I know that obviously you\'ve seen today, tomorrow almost exclusively is the trip down to Fort Hood.\xc2\xa0 I think the highlight Wednesday -- two highlights obviously -- participating in Veterans Day activities first at the White House and then at Arlington National Cemetery.\xc2\xa0 And then later in the day, there will be a meeting to discuss Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And I honestly do not know when we depart on Thursday, but I should figure that out because I\'ve got to pack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Other than that, take us away.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is that the Sit Room meeting on Wednesday?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what number is that?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is it eight?\xc2\xa0 Sounds like eight?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t honestly -- it seems to have sort of -- runs around.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the White House -- well, one thing first, on the meeting with the Israeli Prime Minister tonight.\xc2\xa0 Why is that closed, no press avail, the statements?\xc2\xa0 What is the thinking there?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President obviously is -- will meet later today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss a full range of issues --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- want to meet with him?\xc2\xa0 This meeting was --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as you know, our schedule since late last week has been up in the air.\xc2\xa0 The President was supposed to speak on Tuesday to the same group that Prime Minister Netanyahu is speaking to.\xc2\xa0 He obviously looks forward to sitting down with the Prime Minister tonight -- and continue to work together to address issues like Middle East peace and the threat that\'s posed by Iran.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then separately, what does the White House know about any contacts by the Fort Hood shooter or ties to al Qaeda?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Jennifer, this is a continuing investigation that\'s being led jointly by DOD and FBI.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear with everyone that no stone should be left unturned to figure out how and why this happened, and to ensure that it never happens again.\xc2\xa0 I think the FBI will have updates on their investigation later on this afternoon and I think that\'s the best place to go for that information.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been a determination about whether it was terrorist -- an act of terrorism?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the FBI is the best place to address that.\xc2\xa0 I do not know that they have a lot more on motive, but they\'ll have updates this afternoon.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran has charged three U.S. citizens with espionage.\xc2\xa0 Does this expose the limits of the administration\'s efforts to reach out to Tehran, and could it undermine efforts to get a nuclear deal?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that these three hikers -- Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd -- are innocent young people who should be released by the Iranian government and their release should be expedited.\xc2\xa0 We have not heard confirmation through our Swiss counterparts about charges.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">As it relates to Iran, I guess I would have two different -- make two different points.\xc2\xa0 One, this is an important -- the events of the next few days and the past few days are important for Iran to contemplate as they make decisions, moving forward.\xc2\xa0 They have to essentially agree to their previous agreement on the research reactor, and I think the world is watching and waiting for their conclusive decisions on that.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">With how Iran is dealt with, when that decision is made, I would point you to what President Medvedev said, which was -- over the weekend -- which was if Iran fails to take steps in its control to demonstrate its responsibility to the world, then sanctions may be necessary.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you definitely link the charging of the three citizens with espionage with why the --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I was giving a broader answer.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, notwithstanding whether or not they\'ve been charged, they should be released as they\'re innocent.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Jake.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If President Obama is having the Sit Room meeting tomorrow on Af-Pak, should --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wednesday --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, Wednesday -- should we then expect that his announcement will come after the Asia trip?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve not been told when it\'s going to be, but I think it is doubtful that it will happen prior to Thursday.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would it -- is it conceivable that it would happen during his trip to Asia?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not likely, I wouldn\'t think.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House reached out specifically to Congressman Cao during the health care negotiations before the vote and right before the vote.\xc2\xa0 What did the White House tell the congressman?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, this wasn\'t -- those conversations didn\'t happen just this weekend.\xc2\xa0 Nancy-Ann had met with him many weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 He obviously is somebody who was interested in talking about what was in the President\'s health reform proposal and obviously made a decision that it was in the best interest of his constituents.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that -- in terms of stimulus money going to New Orleans, or is there anything beyond the health care reform bill that --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not that you know?\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- just one other thing on the meeting.\xc2\xa0 Originally I know you guys have been --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which meeting?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, the announcement about the Afghanistan --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Originally you guys have been shooting for before the strategy, and certainly that was not an official deadline, but you guys have been shooting for that.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the reason for taking a little bit more time?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I think, Jake, the President wants to make sure that, as I\'ve said on numerous occasions, take the time necessary to get the decision right.\xc2\xa0 We\'re at a pivotal moment and I think the President wants to ensure that he has all that he needs and has heard from all that have equities in this in order to make a decision of import.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what has -- what could he not have gotten already?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what did he not have already --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, suffice to say, if he had gotten everything he needed, we probably wouldn\'t be meeting on Wednesday.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us just an idea, though, of the kind of thing you\'re talking about?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the Chiefs coming back?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Say again?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this is specifically with Joint Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 I think this is more what has been done -- let me check exactly on the manifest.\xc2\xa0 I think it is more in line with the groups that we had seen in here earlier.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you said -- I\'m sorry to butt in but --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- the Joint Chiefs later on -- I don\'t obviously --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- another one?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- close the door on the fact that there could be more.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, Robert, the President, in his written statement late Saturday, I believe, said again that he wants this done by the end of the year -- he wants the Senate to move by the end of the year, but I don\'t think I heard that in the Rose Garden yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Was that just a little -- like he just didn\'t mention the deadline, or how firm is the deadline in terms of by the end of this year?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It didn\'t change overnight.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it didn\'t change from Saturday night after the vote to Sunday.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, the President still wants to get this done by the end of the year.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, I just wanted to follow up.\xc2\xa0 I understand the schedule has been in flux, but why no television cameras?\xc2\xa0 Is it because you don\'t want to highlight the fact that there\'s not a lot of progress in these talks so far?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, the President wanted to have a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure, Ed, that the contents of the meeting generally seem to be well read out and I trust that this time will be no different.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But typically the President will go on camera if he wants to highlight what is a key initiative for him, and if Mideast peace is that important you would think that he would want to do that.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, like the date didn\'t change from Saturday night to Sunday, I think it\'s pretty safe to assume that the President thinks no less of the importance of the Middle East peace process on simply by subtracting one television camera.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last thing, on settlements.\xc2\xa0 Last week, Secretary Clinton was in Israel, and suggested -- she wanted to praise the Israelis for some progress on settlements.\xc2\xa0 And the Palestinians were upset because the U.S. policy has been a complete freeze on settlements.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Policy dating back several decades, yes.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but specifically it was emphasized in the early days of this administration.\xc2\xa0 And the Palestinians felt like maybe there were some back-peddling.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clear up -- there was a sense that she seemed to be shifting last week.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, again, I judge from your question -- the policy of the United States government for many decades has been no more settlements.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not something that is new to this administration.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that I think has gotten disproportionate media coverage, but it\'s not a policy difference in this administration and previous administrations.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the health care bill, does -- the President supports, endorses, whatever you want to call it, the House bill.\xc2\xa0 He\'s made that very clear.\xc2\xa0 Does he support the abortion funding restrictions in the House bill?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, Chip, as you know, went to Capitol Hill to rally support for the bill.\xc2\xa0 That bill is now through the House, which we\'re quite pleased about.\xc2\xa0 The Senate, once we get budget numbers from CBO, will become -- that will move to the Senate floor.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t doubt that you\'ll have a somewhat different bill.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way this process works, and we\'ll iron out differences as they come.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s his position on abortion funding restrictions?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you heard the President in front of Congress several months ago, and we\'ll continue to make progress.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then he wouldn\'t support anything like the provision that\'s in the House bill?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to become a negotiator from Capitol Hill -- on Capitol Hill from the podium.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he accept something that goes beyond what the Hyde amendment does?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We will wait to see what health care reform brings.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there could be something then in the end that goes beyond current law in restricting abortion funding?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I wish we were having this conversation as the last part of this process, but as your network and others have pointed out, there are miles to go before we sleep.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on the Fort Hood -- the President is getting briefed how frequently on that and by whom?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Certainly as developments warrant, and again, the President\'s daily briefing this morning in the Oval began with an update on the situation in Fort Hood.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern with going down there -- I know often when Presidents go places, hurricane zones and things like that -- was there any concern that by going he could interfere with all of his entourage and security, could interfere in this investigation?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And as we talked about late last week, I think Friday, this was -- obviously the President wanted to go, but wanted to do it at a time that was most convenient for the families of the victims.\xc2\xa0 As I said, families are coming in from all over the country, and we wanted to make sure that our schedule was worked around their schedule.\xc2\xa0 But I have heard nothing to suggest that there were any concerns with his presence on the way down there tomorrow.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one quick question on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that he\'s waiting for another set of recommendations, or a set of recommendations, from the Pentagon. Do you know -- is that true?\xc2\xa0 And has he received that set of recommendations, an additional --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I don\'t know what additional recommendations he\'s gotten.\xc2\xa0 I know the Pentagon was working on additional recommendations.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t know if he\'s received those yet?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it could be a ways off, if he hasn\'t even received this next round of recommendations.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Other than to characterize it as in the coming weeks, I don\'t have any further guidance.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he keep working on it while he\'s in Asia?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\'s no doubt that this is a topic that will be addressed in some of the meetings that he has throughout the trip.\xc2\xa0 I think, along with things like Iran and non-proliferation and North Korea, I think in meeting with people throughout the trip, this will certainly be a topic.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">I mean, obviously -- I mean, for one, the Japanese obviously have been -- have given generously in finances for the training of an Afghan national security force.\xc2\xa0 So this will --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you think he\'ll actually work on his decision on --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 The President spends time on this each and every day, regardless of where he is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Fort Hood investigation, does the White House believe that at some point they will have to be the final arbiter on who takes the lead in the investigation or who prosecutes -- who takes the lead on the prosecution, Justice or the military?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard a discussion about that.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now it\'s still a joint investigation.\xc2\xa0 When you say it\'s the FBI and the military working together, it\'s a joint investigation.\xc2\xa0 This has to do with the death penalty and the various --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Truthfully, Chuck, I don\'t -- I have not heard a discussion about that part of it.\xc2\xa0 The notion of obviously a joint investigation -- during the initial incident, the Department of Defense called the FBI, and the investigation at that juncture was run jointly by the FBI and the DOD.\xc2\xa0 I have not, though, heard discussions of who brings charges and where.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we could be days away from that, weeks away from that?\xc2\xa0 There\'s just no --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Weeks away from --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From charges being --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- yes, I would point you to either one of those institutions.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Neither one -- the Justice Department or the Department of Defense -- hasn\'t asked the White House to make a jurisdictional decision?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Certainly not that I\'m aware of, no.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, what is the Christmas deadline?\xc2\xa0 Is the Christmas deadline to get a bill on the President\'s desk to sign, or is the Christmas deadline to get a bill out of the Senate and out of the House?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can assure you if we get a bill out of the Senate and the House somewhere around Christmas, the President won\'t take a lot of time in trying to sign it.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand that, but the separate bill.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the separate Senate -- if this deadline --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we want to get health care done by the end of the year.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mean signed?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if it gets to his desk, I can assure you there\'s not a huge amount of gap between when it gets here --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I understand, I understand.\xc2\xa0 Understand if I say he\'s going to sign it, let\'s assume conference has happened, right?\xc2\xa0 Let\'s assume we\'ve got a bill that is ready for the President to --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a realistic --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just a bill.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a realistic deadline or are you guys ramping up pressure on Senator Reid to make this deadline?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, we\'ve been doing this for how many months?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve had different deadlines --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And when we say the end of the year, we\'ve got a pretty firm end-of-the-year deadline.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is to sign a bill end of the year, but to get a bill --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How much clearer could I be?\xc2\xa0 Seriously, how much clearer could I be?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\'s ambiguous?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have the deadlines gotten moved?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve just answered this question three times, right?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The deadline is the end of the year to sign?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Please send a transcript to [MR. TODD\xe2\x80\x99S EMAIL REDACTED].</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whoa!</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, all right.\xc2\xa0 So that means -- I mean, I just --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just answered this three times, Chuck.\xc2\xa0 Three times.\xc2\xa0 The President -- let me do this just so I\'m clear, all right.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you want to alert the networks to break in.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to sign health care before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Anybody have a follow-up?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one question.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the trip schedule, the President had intended to leave initially on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 That was always going to be Veterans Day, and I\'m confused why he\'s not leaving on Wednesday now.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because all of what he was going to do Tuesday, while he travels to Texas is now going to take place either crammed into later today or crammed into the latter half of Wednesday past what had previously been scheduled as a breakfast here and a trip to Arlington National Cemetery.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not because he\'s -- he wants to stay in -- he was going to do those Veterans Day events before he left anyway?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 No, the two events that were always on his schedule prior to leaving at that point on Wednesday would have been -- I think it\'s a closed-press breakfast here before traveling to Arlington late morning.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And back on the abortion question.\xc2\xa0 Candidate Obama campaigned as a pro-choice Democrat.\xc2\xa0 This was a big debate between he and Hillary Clinton, who was more pro-choice.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t completely remember that debate, but go ahead.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But anyway, he was a pro-choice Democrat and now he\'s\xc2\xa0 -- the House has passed some of the strictest legislation restricting abortion that we\'ve seen in a very long time.\xc2\xa0 I mean, can Barack Obama, who campaigned as a pro-choice Democrat, sign legislation with this language?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jonathan, we\'ll -- ask me that right before Christmas and the end of the New Year.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Mark.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, did the FBI director brief the President today on Fort Hood?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the -- I don\'t know if Director Mueller was here today in the PDB.\xc2\xa0 He was -- I want to make sure I got my dates right -- he was here --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Friday.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thursday night was the first meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was about 6:20 p.m. that evening.\xc2\xa0 Director Mueller was in that meeting with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen the day of the shooting and was part of the PDB, the extended PDB, on Friday morning.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if -- I don\'t believe he was over here this morning, but let me double-check.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, does the President believe that a single Republican vote makes the House passed bill bipartisan?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 By definition.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, really.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, I don\'t doubt that the President hopes, or wished that more Republicans would recognize that there are people in their districts that they represent, as we\'ve talked about, that are suffering from the skyrocketing cost of health care; who own small businesses that have to either let workers go or drop the insurance coverage that they want to provide; or that represent many that are discriminated against by the practices of insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President would love for this to be -- to pass unanimously.\xc2\xa0 He understands that for whatever reason, some in the party have decided to make a political statement about this.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I noticed that both John Boehner and Mitch McConnell used the word "monstrosity" to believe the bill passed on Saturday night.\xc2\xa0 How do you bridge a gap like that, when they\'re using a word of that --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who was it?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both McConnell and Boehner.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, remember, Boehner announced his opposition to this three months ago.\xc2\xa0 So the notion that he thinks that --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you can be against something without regarding it as a "monstrosity."</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but again, he -- when in the process three months you\'ve decided you\'re against the bill, I\'m not sure that there\'s anything the President can say or do that\'s ever going to convince somebody like that, that -- despite the fact that on the House and the Senate side, Republican ideas have become part of the bill; despite the fact that even when Republican members came back from recess in early September after spending most of August at home, you heard statements like the American people understand we have to address the issue of health care reform; or you see poll after poll done by many of you guys that show the American people want to see something done this year.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know how many more different data points of evidence you need to understand that this is a continual problem that the American people have faced, and it has to be addressed.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I ask a follow-up on the bill signing question?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 One other option, although nobody wants it, is for Congress to attach a health care bill to an omnibus budget reconciliation bill just like they did with COBRA.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s the only way it could get to the President\'s desk, would he sign that as well?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President wants the process to move forward, as it\'s doing.\xc2\xa0 And as continue to make progress, we don\'t see any need to change the process.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what if you don\'t make progress?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll look at alternatives.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to have remarks at Arlington on Wednesday after the wreath laying?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That I don\'t honestly know, but I will double-check.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will there be a readout after the Netanyahu meeting tonight?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we can get you a readout.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To everybody?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To revisit Iowa briefly and the pro-choice debate that went on there, there were those in the Hillary Clinton camp who said because then-state senator Obama voted "present" on some votes, he was insuffiently pro-choice, and that was sort of fought out a little bit --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, that\'s what you\'re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that was --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying it came up.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that was handled by people that the President had worked with, representing those groups, which largely dismissed that argument.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which leads me to the question now -- some of those groups -- NARAL and Planned Parenthood -- have condemned the language in the House bill and want it repealed.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree or disagree with NARAL and Planned Parenthood\'s interpretation of the bill currently?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get deeply into this, except to say that we will work on this and continue to seek consensus and common ground.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In pursuit of what -- just passing the bill?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Health care reform.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But not resolving abortion to the satisfaction of NARAL or Planned Parenthood?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this obviously is something that will have to be addressed in order to get to that point.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with Army Chief of Staff Casey who said yesterday, "As horrific as this tragedy was, if our diversity becomes a casualty, I think that\'s worse"?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President agrees with General Casey that -- look, having sat through the meeting with the Joint Chiefs, there is tremendous pride for an all-volunteer armed forces in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s I think a pride shared by the Joint Chiefs as well as the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 And there are people of many different ethnicities and many different religions that serve with great honor and distinction in our military today, and the President certainly hopes that that continues.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the families who might wonder if that diversity is so important that it\'s -- losing it would be worse than losing their own family member, do you understand how some might think that is elevating diversity over human life or --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that in any way, shape, or form that\'s what General Casey was saying.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you would not want anyone to jump to that conclusion --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t, no.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On climate change, the heavy negotiations for the United Nations and the EU have now become somewhat more publicly vocal in their criticism of the administration in their interpretation it\'s not working hard enough to bring climate change legislation and an agreement to Copenhagen, to have something that\'s substantive that can be a part of the overall negotiations.\xc2\xa0 A, how do you react to that?\xc2\xa0 And B, does the President need, does the administration need Senate passage of a climate change bill to seek a deal within the confines of the U.N. climate change talks?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t give those comments a whole lot of credence.\xc2\xa0 We are closer to an energy and climate bill becoming law than has ever -- we\'ve ever gotten with the passage of it through the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 And the notion that one country stands in the way of addressing climate change would be to forget countries like China, India, Brazil, and others that have to also be brought along in this process.\xc2\xa0 So with all due respect, I don\'t give those comments a whole lot of credence.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Af-Pak meeting that\'s on Wednesday, was that originally scheduled for Tuesday?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe it was, but the schedule obviously -- we knew fairly -- we knew on Thursday the schedule for Friday and the remainder of the days before the trip would change.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it originally was today or whether it was going to be on Tuesday.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you talk a little bit about what he\'s going to do down in Fort Hood?\xc2\xa0 Is there time set aside to meet families?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There -- and this is preliminary and we\'re working on getting more as the schedule itself changes -- the President will meet with families of those that lost a loved one last week, as well as speak to the larger memorial that will take place at the base and address a community obviously saddened and stricken by the events of last week.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the First Lady going to do anything separate from him?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 I know she\'s with him.\xc2\xa0 My sense is she will be with him when he sees the families.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the investigation itself, leaving the details to the FBI and military investigators, does the White House view the suspect as a terrorism suspect at this point?\xc2\xa0 Or is this somebody who is a lone figure?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That should be addressed by the FBI.\xc2\xa0 That\'s who has equities in all of that.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, may I ask a follow-up on the Fort Hood questions?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has been reported today that the suspect in the Fort Hood shooting is now conscious as of this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if law enforcement has begun to ask questions of him regarding causes or motives, or any of the circumstances regarding these acts?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if interviews have begun.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, to say the least, law enforcement are eager to talk.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s obviously part of the reason why this is a continuing investigation where we still need information to draw firm conclusions.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I know we\'ve got a conference call this afternoon, but I just need to ask you very briefly about the trip.\xc2\xa0 In general terms, it\'s been asserted that the President is going to a region where countries are increasingly assertive and not so reflexively -- I don\'t want to say submissive, but they don\'t -- they don\'t reflexively agree to America\'s view, especially a place like Japan with a new government; China, which of course, has been increasing economic -- does the President subscribe to that view?\xc2\xa0 Does he worry about that?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that is -- I guess I\'ll leave it at this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes obviously that many of the places he\'s going to and the leaders that he\'ll see\xc2\xa0 -- I mean, keep in mind we\'ll meet with President Medvedev as part of this.\xc2\xa0 So he\'ll meet with leaders in places that we\'re not necessarily stopping on -- that he believes that the United States and these countries have a series of mutual interests, and that by working together, we can make progress on those mutual interests.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">As it relates to what you said a minute ago, I think if you look back at where people predicted different efforts would be, remember, right after the North Koreans test-fired their long-range -- test-fired a long-range missile, it was widely presumed that there was nothing that could be done to address those actions, largely because the U.N. Security Council wouldn\'t address the geopolitics of certain countries.\xc2\xa0 It took a couple of weeks of tough diplomacy, but Susan Rice and the United Nations worked out a unanimous Security Council resolution to address what happened in North Korea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">I think if you look at where we are with Iran, we\'ve never been at a point that we are now, unified with the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President understands that each country has interests, and where we have mutual interests we can work together to make progress.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 What\'s on the agenda for the meeting with Medvedev?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ll continue to talk through issues that they\'ve spent time working on, most notably the START Treaty that expires I believe the 5th of December, and continue discussions about North Korea and Iran.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, Mara.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I have a question on Fort Hood and also abortion.\xc2\xa0 I understand you\'re leaving the determination of whether this was an act of terrorism up to the FBI.\xc2\xa0 But what is the White House\'s definition of an act of terrorism?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a law enforcement official, Mara.\xc2\xa0 This obviously is a continuing investigation, and if you\'ve got questions about where that investigation is, I think the FBI is going to --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- I just want to know if there is a definition of an act of terrorism that you --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the back-and-forth of this.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 One other question about the House vote.\xc2\xa0 The President has been pretty clear all along that in terms of abortion he thought the status quo should be left untouched; in other words, the Hyde amendment should stand.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that the Stupak amendment enshrines Hyde, in terms of the health care exchanges, or goes beyond it?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m going to leave the answer --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not asking if you\'re for or against.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to know what you think it does.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to leave it at the earlier answer that we\'re going to continue to work through and make progress on these issues.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, as far as you know, has the President decided on number of troops, additional troops he\'d like to send to Afghanistan?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 Despite the many chances to read otherwise throughout the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Safe to say if he\'d made a decision, I think we could free up at least part of his Wednesday.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about a proportional breakdown between trainers, for example, and combat troops, anything like that --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or any thought to where they might come from?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, thought from where they might come from?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fort Campbell comes to mind.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I mean, look, I think -- I mean, obviously there\'s -- we know where very specialized troops are, but I don\'t think that the President has -- I doubt we\'ve have gotten to identifying what fort they\'re at without getting to a number.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, just to circle back to something you said earlier, is the President consulting outside groups or particular people outside the Situation Room to talk about the Afghanistan review strategy?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 Is he having discussions outside of the meetings, or is he talking to participants throughout the process that are different than just those in the meeting itself?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, that\'s my answer.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President has had occasion to talk about the issue of Afghanistan outside of that -- outside of those meetings and outside of just those participants, yes.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, outside government --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Outside -- yes.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- different countries?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At some point obviously there will be very fulsome discussions with our NATO partners.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if we\'re at that point in the process.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is India among them?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t get into listing details.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question on circulation?\xc2\xa0 On circulation?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a seemingly -- hold on, Lester, before I take the premise of your -- we could go into health care, we could go into newspapers, we could go into --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s -- the first -- what is the President\'s reaction --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t agree to two, but I\'m happy to try with one.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll circulate an answer.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We had 10 up here.\xc2\xa0 But what is the President\'s reaction to the Audit Bureau of Circulation\'s report that in the six months ending on September the 30th, American daily newspapers, most of which are liberal and pro-Obama -- (laughter) -- fell 10 points --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Have you read The Washington Post today?\xc2\xa0 Have you read The Washington Post any day?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do, every day.\xc2\xa0 I always keep an eye on the enemy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What did you say?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I always keep an eye on the enemy.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll give them an equal amount of time and a microphone of sufficient size to respond.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Look, obviously the President is a voracious consumer of news, likes to read newspapers every day.\xc2\xa0 I would -- I think if you pick up many of the newspapers with which you discussed -- I notice that there was an article in The New York Times today about the circulation drop in the New York Post, and I\'m not sure I would categorize that as a liberal pro-Obama newspaper.\xc2\xa0 And please, would you just -- if you can cc your question to Fred Hiatt I\'m happy to have a conversation about the liberalism --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow-up, because they had 10.\xc2\xa0 They had 10.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Was that one?\xc2\xa0 Does that count as one?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President\'s reaction to the more than 2,000-page health care bill which so few congressmen read being passed by only five votes and costing more than a trillion dollars, on which 39 Democrats voted no?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He could not be more pleased.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="rteleft">April.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is your circulation?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Spotty at best.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care reform --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- does consensus and common ground negate the original mandate to cover all Americans?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, say that one more time.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does consensus and common ground negate the original mandate to cover all Americans?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President believes that and in order to get certainly many of the important insurance reforms that the President has discussed, covering all Americans is a must.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, also on Fort Hood, the suspect, has he -- has this White House gotten information from federal agents or the Army that he was considered a conscientious objector --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point you to the FBI with specific questions about the investigation.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then back on the issue of terror -- not terrorizing, terrorism, just terror -- the definition of terror:\xc2\xa0 "one that instills intense fear; also the unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 also, one more \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cpanic, an overwhelming feeling of fear and anxiety."\xc2\xa0 These people at Fort Hood went through those feelings.\xc2\xa0 We clearly saw it.\xc2\xa0 Would you classify, from the definitions that I gave --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not a law enforcement official, April.\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the entire country from -- certainly from the very first reports that we got about this, and my communications about that with the President, we have -- I think everybody has been shocked and dismayed at what happened, and pass our thoughts, our prayers, and our condolences on to those who suffered loss for loved ones in this incident.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe there was terror there at least?\xc2\xa0 Could you at least say terror?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve now had three opportunities to be a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but I\'m serious, from the definitions.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\'m not -- if you have investigation questions, the FBI is the place.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 First, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, on health care.\xc2\xa0 Could you say to what degree the White House will get involved in negotiations in the Senate regarding the provisions, whether it\'s going to be the abortion provision or the public option?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the White House obviously has spent a lot of time -- staff work every day with Capitol Hill, and I\'m sure when Senator Reid and others want our opinion on different ideas, they\'ll ask for them.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another question, this is regarding actually -- a Tony Blankley column from a week or so back, made a comparison --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tony --</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony Blankley.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, I thought you said Tony Blinken -- I was going to say, I didn\'t know the Vice President\'s National Security Advisor was writing columns.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry.\xc2\xa0 I was getting a flashback for a moment -- speaking of circulation. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does pertain to national security, actually.\xc2\xa0 He made a comparison with the long investigation into the CIA leak in the previous administration and that similar legal issues could apply in the CIA leak from "political officials" in a news story about Karzai\'s brother working for the CIA.\xc2\xa0 My question is, is the Justice Department going to look into this matter?\xc2\xa0 And would there possibly be a special prosecutor in this case, as well?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have heard nothing about that, but if you have a question about that I\'d ask the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Something on climate change -- Reuters just is reporting that the EPA has sent over its final proposal on carbon dioxide, whether it should be regulated as a dangerous -- sent it to the White House.\xc2\xa0 A, can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And B, how would that fit within the conversation we were having earlier about administration steps on climate change?</p>\n<p class="rteleft">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly we can check.\xc2\xa0 I think there was a -- look, there\'s a court order, right -- there\'s a Supreme Court order that this is an issue that has to be dealt with.\xc2\xa0 The President has said throughout this process that the way to deal with this is through legislation.\xc2\xa0 I would point out that many people in the newspaper this morning that work for or CEOs of power companies that said, this also ought to be addressed through legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re trying to do and that\'s what we hope to do.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p class="rteleft">END\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="rteleft">2:04 P.M.
