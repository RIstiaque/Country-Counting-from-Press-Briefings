EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0It looks like you\xe2\x80\x99re all ready. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked back here and everybody was standing up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tListen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be brief at the top. \xc2\xa0I want to commend to your attention the excerpts that we released about an hour and a half ago. \xc2\xa0That should give you a good sense of the argument that the President is looking forward to making here in Elkhart. \xc2\xa0Obviously the backdrop of this speech is not just the broader political debate that\xe2\x80\x99s going on across the country today but, frankly, a political argument that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on across the country for the last couple of decades about the most effective way to strengthen our economy and about the most effective way to advocate for the middle class in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is looking forward to making this argument and he is also looking forward to the opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have later today to interact directly with some Elkhart citizens and, hopefully, advance the discussion there, too. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So beyond talking about Elkhart, how much is he going to be specific about Donald Trump, the campaign, the differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, et cetera, et cetera?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, let me just observe that over the last couple of months there has been a tendency, understandably, that so much of the argument that the President is seeking to advance is portrayed as a contrast to the presumptive Republican nominee for President. \xc2\xa0And the thing that I would encourage you to do as you listen to the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today is to remember that the arguments that President Obama is seeking to advance and the arguments that have been made by Republicans both predate the presumptive Republican nominee\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on the national stage. \xc2\xa0Many of the things that you will hear the President describe in today\xe2\x80\x99s speech are similar to the themes that he included in his speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2004 and were a continuing theme through his presidential campaign in 2007 and 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I understand that there is a general election that will start soon, and it is certainly understandable that every political debate is viewed through the frame of that election. \xc2\xa0But some of the arguments are diluted if we don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate the decades-long context in which they\xe2\x80\x99re taking place; that the arguments that Republicans have bene making -- and including Republicans up and down the ballot in 2016 -- are consistent with the kinds of arguments that Republicans have been making for decades. \xc2\xa0The same is true of the kind of argument that President Obama is seeking to advance as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the point then? \xc2\xa0I mean, are you making -- what are you trying to get us to see by saying that? \xc2\xa0I mean, so okay, the arguments have been the same -- I mean, frankly, the arguments have been the same for decades no matter what President is in office. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they\xe2\x80\x99re not part of -- or that he\xe2\x80\x99s not attempting to cast them in a new light, given the general election that\xe2\x80\x99s about to start. \xc2\xa0I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s relevant for a variety of reasons, one of which is that there certainly has been a concerted effort by -- well, let me just -- there certainly has been a concerted effort by some Republicans to try to differentiate themselves from the presumptive Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0So certainly what you just observed would raise some questions about whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s an accurate thing to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me also say that the reason that it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly important is the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re having this conversation in Elkhart. \xc2\xa0If we want to acknowledge the progress that our country has made in the last seven years, then we have to go back and look to examine what policies made this progress possible. \xc2\xa0And we have to have an honest debate about that because this is not the last time that a President and a Congress will be faced with some consequential decisions about how best to advance our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so if we acknowledge and recognize that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress in the last seven years -- and no community in the country is a better illustration of that than Elkhart -- then we should take a look at what policies made that progress possible. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to not allow the debate to be reduced to what, admittedly, is a significant election. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to recognize the broader historical context, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of debate that we believe the country should be having.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President frustrated with the current debate as it\xe2\x80\x99s been playing out during the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him evince that frustration. \xc2\xa0And I think, primarily, in fact, the President has actually made I think the opposite argument, which is that he\xe2\x80\x99s been pleased -- this is the argument the President made in his news conference in Japan -- the President has been pleased that even in the context of a vigorous Democratic Primary, and while the two candidates have significant stylistic differences, they\xe2\x80\x99re rooted in basically the same values. \xc2\xa0That there is a commitment to fighting for the middle class; that there is a commitment to making sure that Wall Street -- that taxpayers aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the hook for bailing out big banks for making risky bets on Wall Street; a commitment to expanding access to quality, affordable health insurance; a commitment to things like job training and education and ensuring that the next generation of American workers can compete and win in a 21st-century global economy. \xc2\xa0That the values on the Democratic side are remarkably similar, even in candidates that demonstrate some pretty different political styles. \xc2\xa0The same could not be said on the Republican side. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Governor Pence is out with an editorial this morning in the local paper saying, basically, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recovered in spite of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and basically look what Indiana and its people have been able to do despite onerous regulations and taxes and stuff. \xc2\xa0So how do you that this rebound that we\xe2\x80\x99re all excited about is the result of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and not in spite of them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me -- I think there are a couple of things that we can point to, particularly in Elkhart, where this is resonant. \xc2\xa0One of the most difficult decisions that the President faced in the first several weeks that he was in office was to rescue the American auto industry. \xc2\xa0The community in Elkhart is reliant on the manufacturing sector, particularly as it relates to recreational vehicles. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Elkhart manufacturing sector benefitted significantly from the decision that the President made to make a bet on American auto workers and on the American auto industry. \xc2\xa0That had a pronounced impact on the Elkhart economy, and that is a bet that paid off not just for auto workers, but for the broader economy and the industrial Midwest. \xc2\xa0Some economists have indicated that that decision saved about a million American jobs. \xc2\xa0The President promised at the time that the American auto industry would come back stronger than ever, and we saw that last year the American auto industry manufactured more cars and sold more cars than ever before. \xc2\xa0So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one specific example.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing that we can all acknowledge is true is that if the economy in Elkhart had somehow gotten worse early in the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, that Republicans in Indiana would be blaming the President for the worsening economy. \xc2\xa0And now that the economy has improved significantly, they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to give the President any credit. \xc2\xa0So that may be an indication that the political debate is not entirely on the level. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, I think the other thing that the people of Indiana have benefitted from -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to give Governor Pence credit for this -- is the decision to expand Medicaid. \xc2\xa0Governor Pence did work with the Obama administration to extend Medicaid coverage to some 300,000 Hoosiers. \xc2\xa0That had a positive impact on the economy. \xc2\xa0It certainly had a positive impact on the finances of the state, and it made a difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Indiana. \xc2\xa0And that was only possible because of a law that President Obama signed into law, over the objection of Republicans, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to compromise with the Republican governor of Indiana to implement it effectively. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President will have quite a bit more to say on that line of argument in his speech. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99ve touched on just a couple of I think relevant arguments to make here, but the President will have more to say on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you framed the argument as one about building on progress or reversing the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last eight years. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, even in the Democratic Primary, some real questions about whether that progress has been sort of broad-based enough, whether the middle class has benefitted. \xc2\xa0In Indiana, I think 80 percent of voters were still concerned about the economy in the Democratic Primary and more than a third wanted more liberal policies than what the President has talked about. \xc2\xa0Is there an element of his message today that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be targeted to Democrats, in particular, beyond the broader electorate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech is directed at Americans from both parties, and particularly those Americans that don\xe2\x80\x99t affiliate with a political party. \xc2\xa0I think the President would include himself in the category of Americans who believe that there is a lot more work that we need to do to strengthen our economy. \xc2\xa0And let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we would have done to strengthen our economy if Republicans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t opposed investments in infrastructure, raising the minimum wage, and further investments in research and development, and other things that we know are likely to contribute to the long-term strength of our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President will have more to say about that as well. \xc2\xa0I think the thing that I would -- the only thing I would add is, one of the reasons the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for him to engage in the debate about who the next President of the United States will be is that the strength of our economy will depend on the policies implemented by the next President and the next Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe remarkable progress that our economy has made in the last seven years is important but fragile. \xc2\xa0That progress is reversible. \xc2\xa0And if we go back to tax cuts that are dedicated only to the wealthy, policies that are focused on benefitting the rich and expecting it to trickle down on everybody else, that will set back our economy and that will put at grave risk the progress that our economy has made over the last seven years. \xc2\xa0And it will be middle-class families that have to pay the tab, and the President is concerned about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, just a minor fact-checking question. \xc2\xa0You guys have been calling this his first trip in 2009, but I remember him going to I think it was Maryland --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Williamsburg.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- Or Williamsburg for the Democratic Caucus meeting. \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that have been his first trip, before that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President traveled to Williamsburg to visit with House Democrats, I believe, was the purpose of that trip. \xc2\xa0So that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s first trip outside of Washington. \xc2\xa0But in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s first trip to go and engage with citizens and go and spend time talking to people in a community, the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Elkhart was the first. \xc2\xa0So maybe we\xe2\x80\x99d get a Pinocchio and a half on that one? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just remember being on the plane, so it surprised me when you guys said that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall from that trip that the President got off the plane, went straight to a resort, spent time talking to House Democrats, got back on the plane and came back. \xc2\xa0So, yes, that was officially the President\xe2\x80\x99s first trip I guess outside of the Beltway, if you will. \xc2\xa0But in terms of the President making a trip to go and visit with people in their own community as President of the United States, Elkhart was the first community where he did that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senators Kaine and Murphy, both Democrats who support the Iran ideal, have introduced legislation that would extend sanctions against Iran past 2016, the idea being that there would still be a snapback in place if there was a violation of the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can first say whether that kind of legislation is permissible under the Joint Plan of Action, and secondly, if the White House is supportive of their efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Justin, I have to admit that I have not been briefed on the details of that legislation, so let me see if I can consult with one of my colleagues back at the White House who knows more about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed and see if we can get you a specific response.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I wanted to ask you about the baby that was born in New Jersey with Zika-related defects. \xc2\xa0How closely is the White House watching that situation? \xc2\xa0Does that signal a new level of alarm for you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, what I do know is that our public health experts at the CDC are in close touch with public health professionals in the state of New Jersey to monitor the situation. \xc2\xa0There still is more that we have to learn. \xc2\xa0My understanding about what\xe2\x80\x99s been made public thus far is that this is a child who was born with microcephaly. \xc2\xa0They are still working to determine the link between the potential that the mother had the Zika virus and this particular birth defect, so there\xe2\x80\x99s still some more work that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I will say is we need Congress to act on the funding that our public health professionals say that they need to protect the American people from the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear at this point whether or not it would have made a difference in this particular situation. \xc2\xa0But to the extent that it may remind people that we have a looming threat out there, then hopefully it will prompt Republicans to reconsider their approach thus far, which is to basically deny that there is a problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans have suggested that somehow the government already has the resources that are necessary to deal with this. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not what our public health professionals say. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not what the governor of Louisiana said today when he wrote a letter to the congressional delegation from Louisiana, urging them to support funding for the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also not what the Republican governor of Florida said, who basically called on the Obama administration to expedite every available resource to begin dealing with the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is clear that Republicans outside of Washington, D.C. recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that should be done to support local efforts to fight Zika, and we hope that Republicans in Congress will finally get the message.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow on Rick Scott? \xc2\xa0You mentioned him -- he wrote a letter to the President today, basically outlining a list of demands that they sent the federal government earlier and say remain unfulfilled and are needed immediately to fight the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0Are those things that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to address, using the diverted funds that you have already moved forward, or is your message to him, hey, we need Congress to pass more money to be able to deal with this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our message to Governor Scott is that in order to do everything that our public health professionals say we need to do to protect the American people and the people of Florida from the Zika virus, we need Congress to appropriate additional funds. \xc2\xa0So we certainly do intend to use the funds that we\xe2\x80\x99ve reprogrammed to augment our highest priorities in fighting Zika, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we could be doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s not his question. \xc2\xa0The question was specifically on that list of things that Scott wants and whether or not you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to address some or all of those. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to CDC in terms of what specific steps -- how they will use the money that we have available, and how that overlaps with what Governor Scott requested. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m confident in is that, while I certainly respect Governor Scott and his expertise in health care because I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there to consider, the President is relying on the advice of our public health professionals in terms of what is necessary to fight the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0And what they say is that there is more money that can be appropriated by Congress to do everything necessary to fight the Zika virus and protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, there\xe2\x80\x99s a report that came out Tuesday that I think a thousand migrants have died in the Mediterranean Sea since May 21st. \xc2\xa0The administration -- there was a big story in The New York Times about how you still remain far off-base for the 10,000 refugees that the President wants to admit by the end of the year. \xc2\xa0Is there anything that you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, in addition to the steps that you\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken, to try to expedite the number of migrants coming into the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The short answer to that is, yes. \xc2\xa0I know that the Department of Homeland Security has been working with our intelligence community and other relevant agencies to try to add bandwidth to the ongoing effort to process potential refugees. \xc2\xa0Now, the President has been very clear that he set a higher goal for a higher number of Syrian refugees to be admitted to the United States, but the President made clear that we needed to do that without taking any shortcuts on security.</p>\n<p>\n\tRefugees, after all, are subjected to more vetting and screening than anybody else that attempts to enter the United States. \xc2\xa0The President believes that we need to maintain that standard while also admitting more Syrians who have applied. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why additional capacity is needed, and I know that the Department of Homeland Security and other relevant agencies have been working to expand the capacity that they have to process potential Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the situation in the Mediterranean, it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic. \xc2\xa0And this was a subject of some discussion when President Obama was in Germany last month meeting with some of our European allies. \xc2\xa0Obviously their countries are on the frontlines of this. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s an expertise that the Department of Homeland Security has that they can offer to European officials as they work to secure their borders and as they work to crack down on human traffickers. \xc2\xa0The United States has been supportive of the coordination underway between Turkey and the EU to deal with the flows of migrants.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of important work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done in Europe. \xc2\xa0The United States has been strongly supportive of our European allies as they\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken that effort to try to prevent further tragic loss of life.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, can you tell us a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech tomorrow in Colorado Springs? \xc2\xa0And does he plan to use it to reflect on the status of our military engagements overseas?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you a little more of a detailed preview tonight of what the President is planning to discuss. \xc2\xa0But, obviously, this will be the final time that the President will address one of our service academies as the Commander-in-Chief. \xc2\xa0And I think you can expect to hear the President reiterate his view that his highest professional honor was being the Commander-in-Chief of the greatest fighting force that the world has ever known.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he has to address the graduates at the Air Force Academy. \xc2\xa0It will be an opportunity for him to talk to those graduates about the security challenges that are facing the United States and the important role that the next generation of American servicemen and women will face as they protect the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about the gorilla?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You may.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Whoever had Mike Shear on the Bingo card -- (laughter) -- should collect their fee after the gaggle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a view on the situation with the gorilla in the Cincinnati Zoo, and what happened, and what should happen, and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that the federal government could do, I guess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, it\xe2\x80\x99s --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you talked to the President about it? \xc2\xa0Has he commented on it? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a much-commented-around-the-water-cooler kind of thing in the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any official position that I can articulate from the White House on this matter. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are many people across the country that have their own personal opinion about what may have contributed to what I think can legitimately be described as a tragedy. \xc2\xa0What happened at the Cincinnati Zoo is sad, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me that there\xe2\x80\x99s any federal role. \xc2\xa0I think there are many people around the White House and around the country that have their own personal views on this, but nothing official that I have to convey.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President comment on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0About the commencements -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s two commencements so far have been rather thoughtful, very personal, even feisty at times. \xc2\xa0Have you observed anything different from your point of view about his commencement speeches this year or his writing process for them that\xe2\x80\x99s been different than in past years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. \xc2\xa0I think the President has always viewed the opportunity to deliver a commencement address as a unique opportunity. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s not constrained by a particular setting in terms of making an argument. \xc2\xa0And also a commencement ceremony is something that is naturally forward-looking, and the people who are attending are either graduates or loved ones of the graduates, who are feeling optimistic about the future and have aspirations about what they hope to accomplish in the future. \xc2\xa0And that typically provides a setting for the President to talk about how those graduates and our country can confront that future with optimism. \xc2\xa0And I think that has been the common theme throughout commencement addresses that the President has given since his first year in office. \xc2\xa0And I would expect you to hear the President reiterate some of that optimism in his speech tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I have not detected any difference, either in process or in content, when it comes to the commencement addresses that the President has given this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was CDC data that was released yesterday that showed for the first time during the President\xe2\x80\x99s eight years in office the death rate in America has actually increased, and that was driven in large part by lethal drug overdoses. \xc2\xa0Is there concern that the opioid crisis and some of these other things are erasing the progress in health outcomes that you guys have seen through the Affordable Care Act, I think you would say, or that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen generally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The short answer to that question is, yes, there is a concern that the rapid expansion of heroin addiction and overdoses is having a significantly negative impact on the health of the country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why one of the things that the President and other public health experts have indicated is that for so long opioid addiction and heroin addiction has been treated as a law enforcement matter and as a crime. \xc2\xa0And the point that our experts have made is that\xe2\x80\x99s only partially true; this is also a public health problem. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve now seen is a public health epidemic that is having a tangible impact on the lifespan of Americans in communities, large and small, all across the country. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the other notable characteristic of this proliferation of the opioid problem, is that this is not something that is affecting just one community or one specific demographic but rather is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing have an impact on communities, large and small, and on Americans, young and old. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that is worthy of our focused attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of lip service paid to this issue by Republicans, including in Republicans in Congress, but not a willingness on the part of Republicans in Congress to actually provide additional resources to begin dealing with this problem, to expand the number of public health professionals that could be dedicated to treatment, to expanding the number of beds that are available in treatment centers so that more Americans can get help with their addiction challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the President put forward a very specific plan -- more than a billion dollars in his budget that could be used to address this problem and would have a profound impact on the many lives that have been touched by this problem. \xc2\xa0But as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Justin, Republicans refused to even have a hearing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget. \xc2\xa0For the first time in 40 years, that hearing was not granted by Republicans. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of Republican approach that has fallen far short of what is necessary to deal with a problem that many Americans are struggling with.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are there any lawmakers onboard?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there are any lawmakers onboard, but there are some lawmakers who are planning to greet the President on arrival in Indiana, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have those names for you when we get there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:49 P.M.
