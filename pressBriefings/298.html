Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:04 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for braving the rain to join us today.\xc2\xa0 So I apologize for the late start.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to give you a chance to consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks after the pool spray -- or during the pool spray today -- before we went to your questions.\xc2\xa0 But now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to do that, let\xe2\x80\x99s go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulie, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with the Iran compromise on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen the language, and would the President still veto this compromise that\'s emerging?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, there is a markup that is scheduled for later today in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0 So in the context of this briefing, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to be ultimately definitive about whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to support the product that emerges.\xc2\xa0 But there is some greater clarity I can offer you in terms of our position.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had I think what I could describe as four specific concerns with the way the Corker legislation was introduced.\xc2\xa0 The one that I have talked the most frequently about in public is the requirement for the administration to certify that Iran has not backed terrorism against Americans.\xc2\xa0 And this idea that we could essentially get Iran to renounce terrorism is unrealistic.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged on the front end that this nuclear agreement -- if we can reach one -- will not in any way resolve all of the concerns that we have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and, in fact, one of the reasons we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach an agreement that would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is because we know they are a backer of terror activities around the globe.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is that the legislation, as introduced, had a rather long review period of 60 days that would essentially delay implementation of the bill until this rather slow-moving Congress had an opportunity to consider it.\xc2\xa0 By carving out such a long window for them to review the agreement, it could delay over a long period of time the implementation of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 After all, it\'s difficult to expect that our partners in this process, and even the Iranians, would begin to take important concrete steps before the United States had definitively indicated a willingness to keep up our end of the bargain.\xc2\xa0 So a long delay like this in the implementation of the agreement could threaten the very agreement itself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe third thing is that the legislation, as introduced, did not adequately clarify that a future congressional vote would be focused on the sanctions that had been passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 This goes back to a principle that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated on a number of occasions, which is that the President of the United States is the one who is given the authority under the Constitution to conduct foreign policy; therefore, it is his decision to make about whether or not to enter into an agreement.\xc2\xa0 But we have acknowledged that Congress does have an important and legitimate role when it comes to voting on the sanctions that Congress passed.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fourth thing, and what we have seen over the course of time is that there are other extraneous elements that are not related to the substance of the agreement that sometimes float in and out of the conversations about what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be included in the text of the bill.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we would vigorously oppose any sort of extraneous element not at all related to the agreement that could undermine our ability to implement the agreement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s a long answer, but I did want to try to be specific with you -- as specific as we could -- about the concerns that we have raised about the legislation that Senator Corker introduced.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it seems like at least some of your concerns are addressed as part of this compromise.\xc2\xa0 The review process would be shortened; the language as it relates to Iran ending its support for terrorism has been tweaked.\xc2\xa0 So based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, do you feel like your concerns have been adequately addressed to the point where the President could potentially sign this legislation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on the way that they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this -- again, there is a committee markup process that I both want to be respectful of -- this is ultimately a legislative vehicle.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I also acknowledge that nothing is final until the committee has had an opportunity to conduct the markup and cast votes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut there are some steps that we have communicated to Capitol Hill that they could take to resolve many of the concerns that we have about this process and about this bill.\xc2\xa0 I guess if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me again, I can go through some of those as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to know if the concerns that you have with the Hill are being addressed by this new compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, based on the published reports that are coming out, there is some reason to think that.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\'s not -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything definitive about it until the process has been completed.\xc2\xa0 But let me go through --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re sounding more optimistic about this potential legislation than obviously the original Corker legislation it sounds like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s walk through these changes or the kinds of changes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for, and then we can have a conversation about what our posture would be, which would simply be that if we arrived at a place where the bill that has passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions and not the decision about whether or not to enter into the agreement, that would certainly resolve some of the concerns we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed about the authority that is exercised by the President of the United States to conduct foreign policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing is, as you pointed out, the reports indicate that the link to this terrorism certification measure has been removed.\xc2\xa0 That certainly would be consistent with the objections that we raised earlier.\xc2\xa0 Shortening the review period is obviously an important part of this.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want an unnecessarily -- or at least an unreasonable delay when it comes to implementing the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that we would want members of the committee in bipartisan fashion to confirm is that this piece of legislation would be the one and only mechanism for codifying precisely what the appropriate congressional oversight is into this matter, and to be specific about the way that Congress would vote on the sanctions that Congress put into place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that bipartisan agreement is critical to making sure, frankly, that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an untoward effort to insert a different provision into some sort of must-pass piece of legislation that could really gum up the works here.\xc2\xa0 So getting bipartisan agreement on that is important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, finally, if we could clarify Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role by taking all of these steps -- shortening the review period, being clear about what it is that they\'re voting on, making clear that this is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions -- that that would actually achieve, at least in part, what the President has established as the priority here, which is to ensure that our negotiators have the time and space that\'s necessary to reach an agreement -- if one can be reached -- by the end of June.\xc2\xa0 And if presented with a compromise along the lines that I just laid out here, that would be the kind of compromise the President would be willing to sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is that the kind of compromise that you believe is being worked on the Hill right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, based on public reports, based on what you would expect to be the substantial number of conversations that have been taking place between senior administration officials and Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, that is what we anticipate they\'re going to discuss.\xc2\xa0 But again, I can\'t say anything definitive about this until there has been an actual markup and a debate within the committee and a vote, in part because what we would like to see out of this process is a bipartisan vote that reflects these concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised in these efforts to try to find some common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to move on quickly to two other foreign policy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for indulging me on my long answers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No problem.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on the timing of taking Cuba off the State Sponsor of Terror List?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update in terms of timing, but stay tuned.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also on the meeting on Iraq today.\xc2\xa0 Abadi came here seeming to want more military support from the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President offered $200 million in humanitarian aid. Can you be more specific about what Abadi was asking for?\xc2\xa0 And did the President offer anything in terms of military aid in the private conversations that they had?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do want to be clear about one thing.\xc2\xa0 My understanding, based on the readout that I\xe2\x80\x99ve received of the meeting -- I obviously was not in the Oval Office when they had a rather extensive conversation -- there was not specific request that Prime Minister Abadi presented in terms of additional military assistance.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Abadi is obviously interested in affirming the commitments that the United States and our coalition partners have made to offering up equipment, training, advice and assistance, and even military strikes that back Iraqi security forces on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously, both in private and in public, reaffirmed the commitment of the United States and our coalition partners to this effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe understand that the strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is one that has an important role for Iraqi security forces to play.\xc2\xa0 We also understand that the coalition -- that the United States and our coalition partners are invested in the success of those Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 The success will also depend on the willingness and commitment of the Iraqi government to unite that country and to govern in an inclusive, multi-sectarian fashion.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been gratified that Prime Minister Abadi, on many occasions, has reaffirmed his commitment to those principles.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we understand that obviously the Iraqi security forces are an important part of the strategy, and the United States and our coalition partners remain committed to offering them the assistance and support and backup that they need to continue doing their important work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRoberta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So were there specific requests or offers made in terms of that backup, or for Iraqi security forces?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Robert, there were no specific requests that were made by the Iraqi Prime Minister.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, low oil prices have hurt Iraq, and other oil producers for that matter.\xc2\xa0 But did the Prime Minister ask for any financial help for his country, or financial help in terms of paying for any kind of military aid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of any requests for financial assistance, I can look into a more detailed readout of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 There may be some -- there may be a way for us to help you out on that a little bit more.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the U.S. government about Iran stepping in?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent did the President and Prime Minister discuss those kinds of concerns?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as the President indicated in the Oval Office just moments ago, that there was an extensive discussion about this.\xc2\xa0 And as the President indicated, the expectation would be that two neighboring countries would have an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we understand that that relationship is important because of the large Shia population inside of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Obviously their security is dependent on good relations with their neighbors.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what we would also want to make sure is that the concern for that relationship doesn\xe2\x80\x99t obscure the responsibility that the central government in Iraq has to lead a diverse country and to pull that country together to counter the threat that is posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is what the President said in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 That is the accurate characterization of the private conversation that they had.\xc2\xa0 And we have been gratified by the sustained public support for those principles that Prime Minister Abadi has articulated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the Iraqi Prime Minister made no specific request, but did he make any general request?\xc2\xa0 Did he say to the President, we need more military assistance, just in general terms?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, there was no -- I know that there were some published reports leading up to this meeting that indicated that he was going to come walking in with a stack of papers with a checklist of ammunition and body armor and other military equipment that they need.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m telling you is that there is no sort of request like that that was proffered.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the Iraqis in general -- the Iraqi government has not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I mentioned I think in response to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, the whole reason for having a meeting like this is so that the two leaders can sit down once again and talk about the important aspects of the relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 Obviously part of that relationship, and an important part of that relationship right now, is the security assistance that the United States is providing to Iraqi security forces as they take the fight on the ground to ISIL in their own country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President remains committed to that effort and supporting that effort.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a role for our coalition partners to play, by the way, as well.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the point is there was no specific request that was offered in terms of stepped-up military assistance.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there is interest in both sides in making sure that we protect the strong cooperation that exists between the United States military and Iraqi security forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there anything in those published reports about the specific request that the White House is saying at this point, you know, that\'s not happening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding is that the published reports indicated a prediction that Prime Minister Abadi was going to show up at the White House with an invoice, if you will. And that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that part didn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 That did not occur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Corker compromise, to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question, I thought it was interesting that you said that you would like to see some assurances from Congress that you don\'t have sort of one piece of legislation after another and that this continues on an indefinite fashion.\xc2\xa0 But I suppose just one piece of legislation could become a precarious situation in terms of everybody has put every possible hope and prayer on this piece of legislation passing, or else there\xe2\x80\x99s no nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that this could set up sort of an Iran nuclear cliff of some sort if this gets bogged down up on Capitol Hill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that concern, again, based on the terms that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about and based on the efforts that we have made to ensure that our negotiators have the time and space that they need to reach this agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst of all, what\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand about this legislation is that it essentially is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions, not a specific vote about the decision to enter into an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important clarification, and it\'s important for everybody to understand that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that would be included in this legislation is it would also clearly codify the appropriate oversight that Congress can and should play in terms of this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And what we would seek, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking a bipartisan commitment on, is a commitment that this will be the vehicle for doing those two things -- for laying out the terms of a vote, and for codifying the appropriate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the earlier concerns that you had, you expressed, other people in this administration expressed that these nuclear negotiations that are ongoing right now that have to be completed by June 30th are sort of the purview of the executive branch, and that this is not a proper place for the Congress to be asserting itself?\xc2\xa0 Are you sort of backing off of that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not backing off that at all.\xc2\xa0 What we have sought is clarification --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you are cracking that door open to some sort of involvement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 What we have said all along is that the proper role for Congress in this effort -- and there is one -- the proper role for Congress in this effort is the consideration of the sanctions that Congress put in place themselves.\xc2\xa0 And again, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach a compromise -- which seems to be emerging through the committee -- the compromise would set up a vote to vote later on those specific congressional sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then you could check a box, essentially, to say that -- it\'s not an up or down vote anymore on the deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 It would not be an up or down vote on the deal.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we have opposed for some time for exactly the reason that you\xe2\x80\x99re stating.\xc2\xa0 But that, however, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve also long insisted, does not mean that there is not an important role for Congress to play.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there is.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been an important role for Congress to play from the beginning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that several years ago when Congress put in place these tough sanctions against Iran, they did their part to put these sanctions in place.\xc2\xa0 The administration did our part in terms of working very closely with the international community to coordinate those sanctions so that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply just to the U.S. but to countries around the world.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis had a very negative effect on the Iranian economy, and in such a way that it caused the Iranian currency to be significantly devalued.\xc2\xa0 We saw oil exports from Iran plummet.\xc2\xa0 We saw economic projections about the Iranian economy dramatically reduced.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is what compelled Iran to the negotiating table.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there has been a role for Congress to play.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s also why the administration has worked hard to stay in close touch with Congress about these ongoing diplomatic efforts.\xc2\xa0 And just in the last 12 days, there have been more than 130 calls that have been placed to members of Congress by the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, and other senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 Just in the last two days, Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, Secretary Lew conducted classified briefings to which every member of Congress was invited.\xc2\xa0 So this commitment to robust congressional engagement is one that we take very seriously.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just very quickly and finally -- the reports that ISIL has seized an oil refinery in Baiji, 25 miles from Tikrit, is that a worrying sign?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion in the last week or so that you feel like gains have been made, territory has been retaken.\xc2\xa0 But I would assume that that is an area of concern if that has indeed happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 The thing that I am aware of is that this oil refinery site near Baiji -- I\'m not sure how it\'s pronounced -- but is one that has been the source of a lot of fighting for a number of months now.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the current status of it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Department of Defense about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys asking your counterparts in Congress to let you know exactly which members are attending, have attended, or will attend these briefings?\xc2\xa0 Are you keeping tabs on who\xe2\x80\x99s there and who\xe2\x80\x99s not?\xc2\xa0 And is that something you\xe2\x80\x99d share with us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping a list like that.\xc2\xa0 I suspect that we\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xc2\xa0 I think the way that this usually works is a room fills with people and then it\xe2\x80\x99s people in Congress or legislative officials who are responsible for manning the door, if you will -- moving the velvet rope.\xc2\xa0 I assume that there\xe2\x80\x99s one at the opening of the room.\xc2\xa0 And then our guys just file into the front and offer up their presentation.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have any sort of list like that.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly is a provocative question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s shocking.\xc2\xa0 I never try to ask provocative questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mission accomplished.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had said to us yesterday that there were some people who were never going to vote in favor of this compromise, and basically, it\'s for partisan reasons.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to keep tabs on that, or if it really matters, or not really?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it matters insofar as we think this is a very serious national security issue and that it deserves the appropriate attention from members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is not something that should be placed below partisanship when it comes to the rank order of priorities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen too many Republicans who\xe2\x80\x99ve been interested in trying to capitalize on this situation to score some partisan political points, and that\xe2\x80\x99s rather unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 I think that there would be plenty of people all across the country, in both parties, who would not be supportive of that kind of approach to this issue, given the consequences it has for our national security.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, every member of Congress is going to have to decide for himself or herself about how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to handle this responsibility.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do one politics question also?\xc2\xa0 I guess we could ask the President next time we had a chance, but I\'m wondering how he\xe2\x80\x99s keeping tabs on 2016 now that it\xe2\x80\x99s really kind of up and running.\xc2\xa0 I mean, did he watch the Burrito Bowl video?\xc2\xa0 Is he getting a little politics briefing every day where he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to stay caught up on this kind of stuff?\xc2\xa0 Or is he trying to ignore all of it?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd he said -- you told us yesterday that one reason that he was not likely to endorse a Democrat before the nomination is that some of his friends may still jump in -- besides Hillary Clinton, some of his other friends may yet get into the race.\xc2\xa0 And then we read that Joe Biden told regional reporters whatever he told them -- (laughter) -- and I\'m just wondering, is it Joe Biden that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?\xc2\xa0 Are President Obama and Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley dear friends and we just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) Or who were you talking about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lincoln Chafee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the point that I was trying to make -- obviously Governor Chafee was a very strong supporter of then Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe point that I was trying to make -- maybe it was a little flip -- I have a tendency to do that in the same way you have a tendency to ask provocative questions -- sometimes to my detriment.\xc2\xa0 The point that I was trying to make is that the outcome of the Democratic primary process is one that will be determined by Democratic voters.\xc2\xa0 And they should be the ones to play a role in choosing the next Democratic nominee, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s most important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t make an endorsement in the primary.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he does that in lots of other situations.\xc2\xa0 But the point is that at this early stage in that process, the President has an interest in being respectful to the voters and allowing the voters to evaluate the candidates, and give the candidates or would-be candidates the opportunity to make a decision about getting in.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there are a variety of other people who have indicated the possibility that they may participate in the race.\xc2\xa0 And the President wants to be respectful of the decision-making process that those people have to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGo ahead, Mara.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on the Corker question.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that it\'s really important to make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s not another untoward effort to insert language in some must-pass piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 So are you asking Mitch McConnell to give you some assurance that this is it?\xc2\xa0 In other words, that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be any other Iran deal language inserted anywhere else?\xc2\xa0 I guess I\'m a little unclear on what exactly you\xe2\x80\x99re asking for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we would like is we would like a bipartisan commitment -- we would like Democrats and Republicans in the Senate to commit to making investment in this compromised proposal, if it emerges from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the form that I described.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that investment would mean that we would allow this piece of legislation to do two things.\xc2\xa0 One is, to set up the vote to vote later on congressional sanctions and to codify the proper role of congressional oversight into this matter.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what people should be invested in.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re asking for a commitment that people will pursue the process that\xe2\x80\x99s contemplated in this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that commitment -- I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a big ask.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the people who are opposed to this to try to amend something else.\xc2\xa0 Or you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that -- I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m not too sure what the commitment --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, when you say \xe2\x80\x9copposed to this,\xe2\x80\x9d you mean -- I think that most Republicans have indicated support for the proposal that Chairman Corker has put forward.\xc2\xa0 Is that not -- I mean, you follow it more closely than I do.\xc2\xa0 I could be wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 But I think the point is, is that Chairman Corker has undertaken what is a serious effort to clarify exactly what a congressional vote would look like.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously asserted in sometimes colorful terms about the need for Congress to vote.\xc2\xa0 And he is also codifying in this proposed compromise here the appropriate congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s our view that if this is the path that Congress wants to go down that this is a path that\xe2\x80\x99s worth investing in, and it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subjected -- particularly given the stakes of these conversations -- shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subjected to any sort of untoward effort to insert other provisions into other pieces of must-pass legislation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You gave a long answer to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like if you\xe2\x80\x99d simplify it for my understanding.\xc2\xa0 And I invite you to use --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give a long answer to try to obfuscate.\xc2\xa0 I tried to be specific.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Probably the only time in my career I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you to fall back on some of the clich\xc3\xa9s that press secretaries always fall back on.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So is this a step in the right direction?\xc2\xa0 Is it substantial progress?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does this emerging legislation that will go for a mark-up represent a qualitative improvement, from the White House\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, from where it was, and relieve most, if not all, of the anxieties you had that would have provoked a presidential veto?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me observe a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that -- I mean, we started this briefing by me observing that the Corker bill, as it was introduced, is one that the President continues to strongly oppose and would veto.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a rather long list here of changes that we would like to see in the legislation, and if we can succeed in effecting those changes and build bipartisan support for those changes, then that would be the kind of compromise that the President would be willing to sign.\xc2\xa0 So that is what it is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second thing that I want to reiterate --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s now before would fall in that continuum?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me say one other thing about that, which is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described a number of times as a compromise, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people to gloss over that.\xc2\xa0 Because there continue to be -- if the President were writing this piece of legislation, it would look substantially different.\xc2\xa0 And one of the elements of compromise here is that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking this vote prior to June 30th, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised serious concerns about these kinds of votes occurring while negotiations are taking place.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one element of this proposal on which the administration is willing to compromise.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that even if Chairman Corker and other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in both parties were willing to agree to this substantial number of changes that I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out here that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be particularly thrilled about the legislation that emerges.\xc2\xa0 I think rather what we would find ourselves with is the kind of compromise that the President would be willing to sign.\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But where are we right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, right now, there is a mark-up that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place or scheduled to take place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, does that represent substantial progress?\xc2\xa0 Is it something that you believe is moving in the right direction?\xc2\xa0 All the clich\xc3\xa9s that are a part of this process, please use them.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that all of my colleagues --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a frank discussion?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that all of my colleagues and I will be monitoring the Senate Foreign Relations Committee mark-up process because we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been engaged in extensive discussions with both Democrats and Republicans there.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know as well as I do mark-ups are not designed to fail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark-ups are designed to pass and move things forward, based on a consensus carefully nurtured within the committee and with the administration.\xc2\xa0 Is that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict how things turn out when it comes to congressional action.\xc2\xa0 But I think it is appropriate for you to observe that we have moved from a place where the President was looking at a piece of legislation that he was committed to vetoing, and after the Republican Chairman, working closely with the Democratic Ranking Member, Ben Cardin, have agreed to address a large number of the concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised and to put in place a substantial number of changes that would address those concerns and provide the kind of clarity we need to give our negotiators the time and space to try to reach an agreement -- that that that would be the kind of compromise that the President would be willing to sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that certainly indicates an improvement when you consider -- I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s not a particularly controversial notion -- the notion that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from a piece of legislation that the President would veto to a piece of legislation that\'s undergone substantial revision such that it is now in a form of a compromise that the President would be willing to sign.\xc2\xa0 That would certainly be an improvement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m hesitant here is that I don\'t want to get ahead of the committee markup process.\xc2\xa0 There is important work that they need to do and frankly, we need to see that they\'re prepared to commit to it, and we need to be prepared to see that Democrats and Republicans are going to be prepared to commit to this because --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then you get into process and all the other things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But the bipartisan aspect of this is also important to us, and I don\'t want people to gloss over that, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Another topic.\xc2\xa0 Russia has announced it\xe2\x80\x99s going to sell S-300s to Iran.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli Prime Minister was in a conversation with Vladimir Putin about this.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very much concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, on Capitol Hill there are concerns being raised about this -- that this is a bad thing generally; it raises questions about whether or not this deal should go through.\xc2\xa0 Where does the administration come down on the propriety of the sales themselves, and its relevance -- if you see any at all -- to consideration of the framework?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we have expressed our concerns directly to the Russians about the possible sale of this anti-ballistic missile system to the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 That was conveyed in a conversation between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe concerns that we have, though, are, while significant,\xc2\xa0 separate and apart from the ongoing negotiations that are aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Again, while it\xe2\x80\x99s a substantial concern, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a concern that\xe2\x80\x99s directly tied to the ongoing nuclear negotiations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because we have been clear about the fact --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The argument is why are they buying this defense system if they don\'t intend to create armed ballistic missiles with which to fire?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed on a number of occasions, these kinds of decisions -- this decision-making process inside of Iran is rather opaque.\xc2\xa0 And so trying to divine the intent of the decisions that they\'re making is difficult work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what is clear is that even if we\'re able to reach an agreement at the end of June that would prevent Iran from being able to obtain a nuclear weapon, we\'re still going to have a long list of concerns about their behavior.\xc2\xa0 And it will include everything from their threats against Israel to their support for destabilizing groups in the region, to their support for terrorism, to their unjust detention of some Americans inside of Iran.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe will continue to have some concerns about the weapons technology that they have, about their lack of respect for human rights, other issues on which we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been engaged in robust international action to try to address as well.\xc2\xa0 But all of that is separate from the nuclear agreement.\xc2\xa0 In fact, because of this long list of concerns, that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach a diplomatic agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon; that all these other concerns are enhanced and made even more dangerous if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a nuclear-armed Iran.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to such great lengths to pursue what we believed is the best possible way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly.\xc2\xa0 When the decision is made on taking Cuba off the State Sponsor of Terrorism list, is that a paper statement or is the President feel the need to inform us and inform the country about that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s an announcement about that then I would anticipate that that would come in the form of a paper statement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So picking up from the discussion with Major.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about how Iranian decision-making is opaque, it\'s hard to discern what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s read then on the big question:\xc2\xa0 Have the Iranians made a strategic decision by engaging in this agreement -- the preliminary agreement -- have they made a strategic decision not to pursue nuclear weapons?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel qualified to draw that assessment from here.\xc2\xa0 But let me try to answer that question by saying this, which is that they have made a serious commitment on a whole range of metrics that would prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 What remains to be seen, and this is an open question, is whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to live up to those commitments.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why, for all of the effort that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting into ensuring that we can find common ground with the Iranians on an agreement that they would agree to that would prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, it\'s just as important that we have in place the most stringent, intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, because, frankly, that opacity is a cause for some concern.\xc2\xa0 And it is why, as the National Security Advisor put it, our approach to these negotiations is to distrust and verify.\xc2\xa0 And that is a critically important part of this agreement as well, and securing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation with that sort of inspections program will also be a critical element of any deal, if one is able to be reached by the end of June.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\'m trying to understand.\xc2\xa0 You said you don\xe2\x80\x99t want Congress -- you\xe2\x80\x99re adamantly opposed to Congress voting up or down or in any way on the agreement itself, that that is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s job, that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the job of every President back to George Washington.\xc2\xa0 This is the way that this has been laid out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s your position.\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t object if Congress is going to vote whether or not to pull down sanctions?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been our -- that\xe2\x80\x99s actually not a -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of new things today.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s new.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that Congress would have a vote when it comes to the sanctions that they put in place.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Congress were to assess this deal and vote to leave the sanctions in place -- not simply not to take them down but to leave them in place and, in fact, tie your hand -- I mean, some of the discussions that have been whether or not to take away the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to do a temporary taking down of the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on that?\xc2\xa0 All you\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating from your side is sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with members of Congress right now is about a piece of legislation that Senator Corker has put forward that essentially is a vote to vote later.\xc2\xa0 And that does set up the possibility down the line, Jon, where after an agreement is reached, after June 30th, if the international community has come together and secured a solid commitment from Iran about steps they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to take to limit and, in some cases, roll back critical elements of their nuclear program, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve signed on to cooperate with the most intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and the international community is willing to go along with it -- then Congress will have to make a decision.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if there are members of Congress who are willing to step forward and say, we acknowledge -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve reviewed the details -- because they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to review the details of the agreement -- if they review the details of the agreement, they hear from our scientists that this definitively prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, they hear that our P5+1 partners -- that includes some our closest allies including the United Kingdom, Germany and France, that includes some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s other powers in Russia and China, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t friends of ours on every issue -- that if all those people are signed on to it, then members of the United States Senate will have to make a decision about whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to walk away from that and disengage.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if they do, the question that they will then have to ask themselves is, what are they going to do to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon?\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to flush down the toilet the best bet that we have for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, then what is the option that they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to consider?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI suspect that what many of them are going to say is the same thing that John Bolton said, which is that we should carry out a military strike.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very dangerous proposition. It\'s certainly not consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to these issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the point is, what the legislation that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is considering now is a vote to vote later on congressional sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that that vote that they would take later is inconsequential.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an important one, but it\'s one that would not take place until after an agreement is reached, if an agreement is reached.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And even if the President agrees to this compromise deal that\xe2\x80\x99s coming through the Foreign Relations Committee, you\xe2\x80\x99d still, under the circumstances you just outlined, I imagine see a very strong veto threat from the President on any provision that would force those sanctions to remain in place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of ifs here and I would acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 But sort of if you go through all the ifs -- if Iran agrees to take the steps, if they agree to submit to the inspections, if the international community agrees, if it can be certified by our top scientists -- if all of those things are in place and there is strong international agreement about that, then, yes, the President would be very vocal in encouraging Congress to be supportive of that international effort to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other question on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there have been allegations of war crimes by certain Iraqi units that have been fighting ISIS, some of the same units that have been very strongly supported by Iran.\xc2\xa0 Did this issue come up?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s level of concern about that question -- Iraqi military units that are accused of basically the same kind of war crimes that ISIS is?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of that part of the conversation.\xc2\xa0 We can look and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s additional information that we can provide about that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a general matter, what we have been clear about is the need for Iraqi security forces to both be accountable to the Iraqi central government, that they need to be under the command of the Iraqi military, and that they need to conduct their operations with a healthy respect for human rights, and consistent with the kind of multi-sectarian vision that Prime Minster Abadi has laid out for the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are there any safeguards in place to assure that U.S. aid going to the Iraqi government, to the Iraqi military, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end up in some of these units that have been accused of this activity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the support that we provide to the Iraqi security forces and to the Iraqi military is obviously intended for those units that are under the direct command of the Iraqi military, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the intent of that assistance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOkay.\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wonder if I can just clarify a little further\xc2\xa0 -- I\'m sorry -- on this question of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 I must have written these notes down wrong, but what I heard you say was that it would be okay to observe that we\'ve gone from a piece of legislation the President would veto to a piece of legislation that\'s undergone substantial revisions such that it\'s now in the form of a compromise that the President is willing to sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, assuming that it makes its way through the committee process consistent with the substantial changes that I have discussed here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is, if there are no further amendments, is the legislation as it\xe2\x80\x99s now being presented meet that test?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think -- the legislation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been presented yet because it\xe2\x80\x99s still going through the committee process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say for the sake of argument that Senator Earnest, a Democrat from the American heartland -- (laughter) -- calls up Denis McDonough and says, I got to vote on this thing one way or the other, there are going to be no more amendments.\xc2\xa0 Do I vote yes or no?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for the -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s separate that out.\xc2\xa0 It depends on whether or not Senator Earnest serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He does serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A regarded member of the committee, and he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for guidance from his President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that that fictional members of Congress would have heard frequently from the White House about the committee\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of this piece of legislation, and that if he were presented with essentially a compromise proposal that has addressed the concerns that we have laid out with the bill that was originally introduced by Chairman Corker, and accommodated some of these other things that would make it a legitimate compromise, then we would be in a position of asking both Democrats and Republicans to support it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll ultimately have to decide for themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make its way through that process, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in regular consultation with senators who are participating in that process.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to decide for themselves.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask this -- are you asking for further changes beyond what Senator Cardin and Senator Corker have agreed to?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have sought is -- well, what we have indicated is that if the legislative proposal goes through the committee process and emerges, again, with the changes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve sought to make it a better compromise, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated the President would be willing to sign it.\xc2\xa0 So again, there are -- it doesn\'t mean that we would --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s not -- I hate to say, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not really the answer to the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The question is, is the legislation that the two senators have agreed to, are you asking for further changes to it, or are you not at this point asking for further changes to it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to say that we\'re not asking for further changes to it because there are lots of concerns that continue to have about it, right?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what makes it a compromise.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why I\xe2\x80\x99m unwilling to say that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I am willing to say is that despite the things about it that we don\'t like, enough substantial changes have been made that the President would be willing to sign it because it would reflect the kind of compromise that he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so as it stands now, absent further changes, the President is willing to sign it?\xc2\xa0 Even though he doesn\'t like all it, he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to sign it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t mean to keep going back to this, but this is really important.\xc2\xa0 As it stands now, it\xe2\x80\x99s still going through the committee, and that\'s why I\xe2\x80\x99m unwilling to weigh in too definitively about this is because we have to see what goes through the committee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so I don\'t want to stand up here and say, oh, yes, we support the thing, and then I come out of here and I turn on C-SPAN and it seems that somebody has added another provision to it, and you ask me why we\xe2\x80\x99ve changed our position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s understandable if someone changes it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re asking you is the current version of it -- Senator Earnest gets a yes or no.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He does.\xc2\xa0 And the current version is one that\xe2\x80\x99s still being debated in the committee.\xc2\xa0 But, again, what we have made clear to Senator Earnest and the Senate Democrats that actually exist --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t quote that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have made clear to Democrats and Republicans in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is that the President would be willing to sign the proposed compromise that is working its way through the committee today.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s a little more quotable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That took a long time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for a lack of effort, I assure you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on two other subjects.\xc2\xa0 Going back to a question that I asked yesterday and you gave the answer where you said it was flippant, it was a flippant answer.\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the President\xe2\x80\x99s friends, the possibilities of them running for President, with this friendship do these people come to him and say, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about this, what kind of advice would you give me for a rollout, what have you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If they do, that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I would talk about from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, because the President is entitled to be able to have some private conversations.\xc2\xa0 And if there are individuals who come seeking his advice, they often but not always will seek to do that confidentially, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an entirely appropriate thing for them to ask and to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you were very forthcoming when we asked if the President gives Hillary Clinton automatic support.\xc2\xa0 You said no, and you talked about the friends.\xc2\xa0 Could you at least say that some of them have come to him and said, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about it.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give names.\xc2\xa0 We will assume.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I mean, could you at least say that some of them have come to him, if they have?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that because I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of reading out any private conversations the President may have had about this.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has conversations with a large number of people about a wide range of issues, including occasionally politics.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be more specific.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On another subject, today marks the year that the Nigerian girls went missing.\xc2\xa0 Is there thought or is there proof in this administration that the case is cold?\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that many are concerned that the girls have been sold off or other things have happened to them.\xc2\xa0 What is the thought here in this White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, for a year now, the people around the world have been concerned about the safety and wellbeing of those girls that were kidnapped.\xc2\xa0 The United States has taken steps to try to augment the capabilities of the Nigerian security forces to counter the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by Boko Haram but also to try to find the girls who were kidnapped.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tUnfortunately, this kind of kidnapping story is one that is becoming all too familiar in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a recent report from Amnesty International out that indicates that there are a large number of girls in Nigeria who have been victimized and, in some cases, kidnapped by Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be very concerned about that and we continue to be supportive of the efforts of the Nigerians to counter the depraved tactics that are employed by Boko Haram.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the Nigerian government is really as serious about finding the girls and going up against Boko Haram as they want to present to the world community?\xc2\xa0 And I ask that because last August when the President held his Africa summit here in Washington, the President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, talked to a crowd of people and he was not as serious -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use that term -- as serious about the possibilities of finding them as some would have thought here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Is there that concern that the Nigerian government -- from this White House -- that the Nigerian government is not as serious in finding the girls and in combatting the other issues that you just spoke about at the podium?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is there actually is a government transition that\xe2\x80\x99s underway in Nigeria right now; that there was a presidential election that was held just a couple of weeks ago and there is a democratic transfer of power that\xe2\x80\x99s preparing to occur in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 So at this point, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t offer up a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking before this transition.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of Goodluck Jonathan last year, here in Washington, when he was indeed the President, not transitioning, hoping to remain President.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking of that time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see his comments.\xc2\xa0 We certainly -- I will tell you that everybody here in the United States and I think people all around the globe understand the serious threat that Boko Haram faces poses*.\xc2\xa0 And I would think that the political leadership in Nigeria, based on the total devastation that Boko Haram has left in its wake, understands that this is a threat to the safety and security of that country and its people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going back to this conversation with Goodluck Jonathan last August -- he was talking about countries that are helping to find the girls, and he really put on a pedestal Israel and its efforts.\xc2\xa0 Has the United States worked with Israel and other countries collectively or more kind of independently, each group doing -- each country doing something different to find the girls?\xc2\xa0 Is the United States working collectively with Israel and other countries to help find the girls?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The United States has taken efforts to both augment the capabilities of the Nigerian security forces while also ensuring that those efforts are integrated with the international community that\xe2\x80\x99s responded to this situation.\xc2\xa0 There is obviously a significant humanitarian need.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a significant security need in terms of providing security to communities inside that country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously an effort underway to try to prevent acts of terror, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a counterterrorism effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway.\xc2\xa0 And then there is this effort to try to find the girls that have been kidnapped.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a substantial number of operations to try to address the many needs of the Nigerian people, particularly as they try to counter the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by Boko Haram.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is engaged in that effort.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s military personnel and other personnel with specialized capabilities who are working closely with the Nigerians as they confront this very difficult challenge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this year anniversary, is there hope?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, there\xe2\x80\x99s always hope that the forces of good will be able to overcome some of the destructive, violent forces that get a lot of attention in this world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrancesca.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, I have a question on Mr. Abadi\xe2\x80\x99s visit and then, not shockingly, I also have a question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 First, can you explain why there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a joint presser today?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the pool spray was quite lengthy, and so I just wondered what the thinking was on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, as you know, Francesca, the President took a question with the Jamaican Prime Minister last Friday when he was in Jamaica.\xc2\xa0 The President did conduct a news conference on Saturday in Panama, where he took five or six questions from White House reporters.\xc2\xa0 And so just for the sake of time on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, we did not have a formal news conference but the President did take two or three questions in the Oval Office during the pool spray with Prime Minister Abadi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And then on the Corker bill, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re hesitant to talk about the future so I\xe2\x80\x99d actually like to go back.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had lengthy discussions in the briefing room on the Corker bill before today.\xc2\xa0 And every time when you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it before and reporters have asked you about the bill and what it would take for the administration to support it, if there was any way that the President would not veto it, we have been -- you really hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been saying anything, just saying that you would veto it before today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to understand is what happened in between he\xe2\x80\x99ll absolutely veto it, which you had just said yesterday, and now today suddenly there\xe2\x80\x99s compromises that can be made and maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll support it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and what has happened in that intervening period is that there have been a substantial number of conversations between senior White House officials, other senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, and Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI noted that the President had telephoned Prime Minister -- Prime Minister? -- Senator Corker last week.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You can tell this briefing has gone on for a little while.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get tired.\xc2\xa0 So I gave him a nice promotion, I guess.\xc2\xa0 The President had the opportunity to telephone Senator Corker last week and have a conversation with him about the Iran agreement that had been reached the week before.\xc2\xa0 I made clear in reading out that conversation that they did not engage in negotiations around the legislation that Senator Corker had put forward.\xc2\xa0 But there have been a number of conversations with Senator Corker at the staff level, and there have been an even larger number of conversations with Ranking Member Senator Ben Cardin and other Democrats who serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to try to broker this bipartisan compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, this is an effort that\'s not yet been completed because there\xe2\x80\x99s a committee process that we need to respect.\xc2\xa0 But what seems to be emerging is a substantially different piece of legislation that clearly codifies the congressional oversight role in this process, and clarifies exactly what the congressional vote on sanctions would be on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo essentially, this bill to -- or this vote to vote later is a way for us to find that common ground where we acknowledge that Congress has a legitimate role to play when it comes to congressional sanctions, while at the same time protecting the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to make a decision about this deal that is in his mind clearly our best bet for preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the other thing that I would acknowledge is something I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged over the last couple of weeks, which is that those negotiations have taken place in private.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is part of what makes them more likely to succeed if both parties feel like -- and when I say both parties, I mean people on either end of the phone that are not always members of different political parties; sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re the same political party.\xc2\xa0 But when those conversations are taking place that people can float different ideas and offer up different proposals.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, we\'re going to have to see how this works its way through the process.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly -- what we could be seeing here is the kind of compromise emerge that the President would be willing to sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then quickly just to clarify on that point, because the conversations did take place in private.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is the first we\'re really hearing about this.\xc2\xa0 And so what you\'re saying is that even in the last 24 hours, conversations have taken place -- including one presumably with Senator Corker and Senator Cardin in which they said that they would introduce the bill the way that you\'re suggesting, with the compromises that you\'re suggesting, or at least that they would support those changes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to read out any specific conversations.\xc2\xa0 But there have been frequent conversations, yes -- even in the last 24 hours -- in which the information that I described at the beginning of the briefing was extensively discussed as you would expect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you give us a sense of when you heard about what we now see as this version of the bill that we believe is going to go to markup I guess now at 2:45 p.m.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve started to hear some elements of this start to emerge yesterday -- at least I did.\xc2\xa0 There may be some people who are more directly involved in these negotiations who were aware of this sooner.\xc2\xa0 But I was certainly aware that there were frequent conversations that were ongoing between White House officials principally.\xc2\xa0 But this obviously, as you would expect, included input from Secretary Kerry and officials in the State Department and others.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Treasury Department has an important role to play here.\xc2\xa0 They are the ones who are responsible for enforcing the sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there are a large number of people involved here, and that\'s part of why you\'ve seen such a large number of conversations that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described between administration officials and members of Congress, even in just the last 10 or 12 days here -- more than 130 phone calls.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s indicative of the robust consultation that\'s been ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMany of those conversations have not been focused on the legislation, but actually focused on the terms of the deal that was brokered in Switzerland between the international community and Iran.\xc2\xa0 But some of those conversations certainly did relate directly to trying to find some bipartisan common ground, some compromise proposal that the President would be willing to sign.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a painstaking effort, and there\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to do in the committee, but that\'s where we stand right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the many concerns that you\'ve expressed about the Corker bill was that it could obstruct the nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 Does this remove an impediment to a deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly addresses a lot of the concerns that we had that would have undermined our ability to reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 The first is the long review period.\xc2\xa0 What had been a 60-day review period appears to have been reduced to a 30-day review period.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important because, as I mentioned, if the world has to wait two months before they implement an agreement that\'s been reached, that is going to undermine our ability to successfully implement the deal.\xc2\xa0 Thirty days is I guess probably -- I would characterize as longer than we would like, but not entirely unreasonable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one example.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe terrorism certification thing is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a couple of times in here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unrealistic for anybody to expect that the administration would be able to certify that Iran has essentially renounced terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And to make the agreement contingent on that kind of certification is little more than a poison pill designed to ensure that the agreement could not be implemented.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why it was such a priority for us to ensure that that provision was removed from the bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that we wanted to do -- and this is something that the President also spent a lot of time talking about just over the weekend in Panama -- was ensuring that our negotiators had the time and space that they need to try to reach an agreement by June 30th.\xc2\xa0 And by clarifying exactly what the congressional vote would be, and by codifying what the congressional oversight is going to look like, we can give a lot of assurances to our allies and partners in these negotiations to make sure that they understand exactly what Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role in this is going to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt also allows us to have a conversation with the Iranians, who may be -- who I know are sort of looking warily as us across the negotiating table because we\'re driving a really hard bargain.\xc2\xa0 They also want to make sure that if they make all of these commitments to limit their program, to roll back key aspects of it, if they agree to these kinds of intrusive inspections, they want to make sure that the party on the other side of the table is going to be willing to implement the agreement that -- to implement the agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd by offering up some greater clarity about the congressional role, we can ease any concerns that they may have about our ability to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you essentially saying that this could have the opposite effect of what you would have thought going into it, in that it actually maybe helps by sending a unified message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think I would go that far, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I would go that far.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would describe this as is a compromise.\xc2\xa0 And Congress has articulated very clearly and strenuously their desire to vote.\xc2\xa0 And the proposal that\'s been put forward to vote to vote later is a reasonable one and does reflect -- along with all the other changes that we have called for -- does reflect the kind of compromise that the President would sign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to take you back to the Iraq question.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that the strategy as it\xe2\x80\x99s currently undergoing in Iraq vis-\xc3\xa0-vis fighting ISIS, it is working?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that by working closely with our coalition partners in supporting the Iraqi security forces, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress.\xc2\xa0 The latest estimate from -- I believe this is from the Department of Defense -- is that 30 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previously control, or close to 30 percent of the populated areas that ISIS previously controlled are no longer areas where ISIL has freedom of movement, and that\'s an indication that important progress has been made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, obviously you have Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s second largest city, Mosul, that is still under the control of ISIL, so there is nobody who assumes that this effort is done.\xc2\xa0 But I think that we can already see that this effort is having tangible benefits both for the Iraqi people but also for the national security of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it your sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s frustration then on behalf of the administration that the so-called good news is not getting out?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think what we\'re focused on is making sure that the strategy that the President laid out is one that we are implementing to maximum effect.\xc2\xa0 And that means working closely with the more than 60 countries that are part of this international coalition.\xc2\xa0 It means taking as many steps as we can to deepen our cooperation with the Iraqi security forces and all of the forces that are under the command of the Iraqi military, to make sure that they have the support they need to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their country.\xc2\xa0 We\'re seeing that when they\'re backed up by coalition military airpower that their effectiveness on the battlefield is significantly enhanced.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise to anybody, but it does reflect the successful and effective implementation of the strategy the President has designed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You are aware then of the circumstance in Tikrit today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could be a little more specific?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Very serious death toll there.\xc2\xa0 Once again, the battle is raging on once again in that city.\xc2\xa0 It just sort of underscores this notion that whenever -- it seems whenever the administration says things are moving in the right direction -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Vice President sort of allude to that -- then there\xe2\x80\x99s this sort of slap-back.\xc2\xa0 Are you not careful, then, to sort of proclaim progress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Kevin, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that important progress has already been made in terms of there\xe2\x80\x99s 30 percent of the territory that ISIL previously held in populated areas, or at least close to it, is now areas where ISIL cannot freely travel.\xc2\xa0 And on previous occasions when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about Tikrit, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about the fact that we anticipate that these kinds of military operations are not going to move in a straight line, that there\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be an ebb and flow to the conflict.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of that.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the progress that has been made and there is certainly no denying that it has been important progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about a report that I read about -- a possible ISIS training camp about eight miles away from the U.S.-Mexican border.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard anything about that at all?\xc2\xa0 And can you confirm that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty skeptical of that report, to be honest with you, but let me check on it for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDrew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that the Iraqi government has the capability to take back Anbar Province, something that took the U.S. -- much better armed and equipped and trained U.S. troops years to do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously those kinds of decisions about the pace of military operations are going to be decisions that are driven by Iraqi military commanders and the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be interested in consulting with the United States and our coalition partners as they consider these decisions.\xc2\xa0 The Iraqi security forces can certainly count on the support of our coalition partners, both in terms of providing them equipment and training, and military airpower being in place to back them up.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, these kinds of broader strategic decisions are decisions that are going to be driven by the Iraqi military and the Iraqi political leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President today didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any new commitments in terms of military aid to Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Should we understand from that that he believes they have all the tools they need to carry that out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as I mentioned earlier, the Iraqis didn\xe2\x80\x99t make a specific request for additional military assistance.\xc2\xa0 What the Iraqis sought to do and what the President sought to do is to renew and deepen our commitment to the strategy that the President has put in place.\xc2\xa0 And this is a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on making sure that Iraqi security forces have the training, equipment and advice that they need to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.\xc2\xa0 The United States has made the commitment to engage in those training efforts and to provide a lot of that equipment.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve also committed to do is working with our coalition partners to back up their ground operations with military airpower.\xc2\xa0 And that is a strategy that has yielded important progress so far.\xc2\xa0 But there is significantly -- there continues to be significant, important work that remains to be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A domestic budget question, if I could.\xc2\xa0 This morning, the House Appropriations Committee started releasing some of this year\'s spending bills.\xc2\xa0 And they appear to be adhering to the spending cap.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still determined not to accept bills that don\xe2\x80\x99t lift the sequester?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Putting the sequester back in place would have a terrible impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 That is a proposal that is a nonstarter in the mind of the President.\xc2\xa0 And we have succeeded in the past, in the last couple of years, in being able to work -- Democrats and Republicans -- work together to find a bipartisan way for us to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting critically important investments for this country.\xc2\xa0 And the President is hopeful that Republicans will abandon the partisan approach they\xe2\x80\x99ve adopted so far and consider the kind of bipartisan approach that will make their legislation more likely to be signed into law, but also the kind of legislation that we know will actually have a beneficial impact on the U.S. economy and not one that will undermine the economic progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made so far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
