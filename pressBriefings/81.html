EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard, everyone, to Air Force One en route to the University of Chicago Law School, where President Obama taught constitutional law for over a decade, where he\'ll participate in a discussion on the Supreme Court and the integrity of our judicial system. \xc2\xa0The President is very much looking forward to visiting the institution that helped shape his dedication to the rule of law, the role of the presidency, and his fidelity to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There he\xe2\x80\x99ll be reunited with his former colleague, Professor David Strauss, and engage directly with the audience of students, faculty and a few of his former law students.\xc2\xa0 The President will discuss today how he fulfilled his constitutional responsibility and presented the American people with the exceptional nominee for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest court.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth the President and Chief Judge Garland call Chicago their hometown.\xc2\xa0 Chief Judge Garland grew up in Chicago, specifically in Lincolnwood, and his parents were deeply involved in the community, with his mother serving as a volunteer and his dad running a small business from their basement.\xc2\xa0 This impressed upon Merrick Garland the importance of working hard, dealing fairly in service to the community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President this afternoon will continue making the case for why Chief Judge Garland and why the American people deserve for the Senate to fulfill their own constitutional responsibility to give this eminently qualified nominee a fair hearing and an up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 For us, this is bigger than party or politics.\xc2\xa0 This is about democracy and the institution to which Justice Scalia dedicated his professional life.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Senator Dick Durbin, *<span class="s4">Senator Amy Klobuchar</span>, and Representative Mike Quigley are aboard Air Force One and will be with us at the University of Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Senator Kirk invited?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t come?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 You should check with his office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0*Reuters is reporting that the White House is declining to offer public support, as they say, for draft legislation that would empower judges to require technology companies like Apple to help law enforcement crack encrypted data.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I saw that report, and I don\'t know what it\'s based on, because as I understand it, this is legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s not even introduced yet.\xc2\xa0 Our position on encryption is well-known.\xc2\xa0 We support strong encryption.\xc2\xa0 We believe it is a key tool for cybersecurity, for innovation, and to protect people\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.\xc2\xa0 So the President has said before that there\xe2\x80\x99s no scenario in which we don\'t want really strong encryption.\xc2\xa0 Now, at the same time, we do understand we want to make sure that we don\'t allow terrorists a safe haven to operate in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we will continue to engage with the private sector to discuss the national security and public safety challenges we face with the use of encryption.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it pertains to this particular piece of legislation, I\'m sure we will take a look at what they\xe2\x80\x99re proposing and be in touch.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the report actually says you\xe2\x80\x99ve already offered some kind of comment on it.\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to necessarily publicly, but that you have seen a draft.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen a draft that you know of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the precise granularity of our exchanges with those offices, but I can tell you that this remains a priority for the President.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll absolutely be in touch with those offices.\xc2\xa0 But the idea that we\'re going to withhold support for a bill that\'s not introduced yet isn\'t accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it the kind of thing, though, given the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99ve backed DOJ in their effort against Apple, would this kind of thing, if you codified it in legislation, would it make it easier if it\'s already in legislation and it\'s law?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We\'re always willing to work with members of Congress on issues like this.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this issue is complicated, and that\'s why a national dialogue to help the American people understand it is important.\xc2\xa0 So the President has said there\xe2\x80\x99s benefit to a national dialogue and one that is not just specific to the encryption issue but a broader discussion of the issues related to terrorist use of social media and other communications.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you guys have often reported, the President has engaged with the private sector on this.\xc2\xa0 So have top administration officials, because we believe it\'s important.\xc2\xa0 It\'s also a complicated piece of business.\xc2\xa0 Josh likes to draw the analogy to child pornography.\xc2\xa0 That was also complicated with sort of legal and privacy concerns, as well as business interests all at stake. And we were able to work with all of those different entities and components to come up with some solution that achieved all of our goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Would you support a law that would actually buttress that kind of effort when it comes to things like San Bernardino?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\'re happy to take a look at any legislation that\'s being proposed.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President is a strong proponent of encryption.\xc2\xa0 He believes that\'s important for not only cybersecurity, protecting people\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, but also for the heart of innovation in our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President expecting in terms of an outcome from this appearance today at the University of Chicago to continue making the case, as you said, for Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think today is going to be an opportunity to have a discussion about the importance of rule of law in our country and I think you can expect the President to make that case.\xc2\xa0 This will be a -- the President will have opening remarks, then he\'ll have a conversation with Professor Strauss, who, himself, has argued 18 times in front of the United States Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And then they\xe2\x80\x99re going to open it up for questions with the audience.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think you can expect the President to draw on his experience at the University of Chicago Law School and talk about not only fidelity to the rule of law but the importance of having each branch of government functioning.\xc2\xa0 This is something that\'s important for the President, presumably important to many people, but it was something that was expressly articulated by President Reagan when there was a vacancy in the Supreme Court in the final year of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 He said that every day that goes by without the Supreme Court having a fully staffed bench impairs their ability to do the important work that they have in front of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you also tell us why the President has his daughter with him today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, on these trips, the President is sometimes fortunate to have his family accompany him.\xc2\xa0 Malia is joining the President for this trip to Chicago and then she\'ll be with him for a few days in California.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\'t expect her to have any public events or any public schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, just to follow up on Darlene\xe2\x80\x99s point, in terms of the audience that the President is speaking to today, can you talk a little about potentially which constituency -- obviously there are plenty of people who, right now, support this nomination.\xc2\xa0 There are many people who are adamantly against it. So who are those people who he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to reach with this discussion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this will be a broad discussion.\xc2\xa0 And if you take a look at people who believe that this seat should be filled and confirmed consistent with past precedent, that\xe2\x80\x99s a belief that\'s not just enjoyed by this President, but is actually a widespread belief.\xc2\xa0 If you look at public opinion polls, many of which have been sponsored by your news organizations, if you look at editorial boards from across the country -- I think we\'re up to about 300 editorial boards -- and newspapers that aren\'t necessarily always inclined to support this President -- and if you look at what the Constitution says, the President believes that this is a responsibility not only of him to put forward a highly qualified nominee, but also of the United States Senate to confirm that individual.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s where our focus is.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is in the hands of the United States Senate right now.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us take the process of Senate confirmation very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And if you recall, in the hours of Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s untimely passing, Republicans announced they would refuse to consider any of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to the Supreme Court, in fact calling on us to not even nominate someone.\xc2\xa0 We believe that position was manifestly untenable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they also argued that they wouldn\'t meet with any nominee that we put forward.\xc2\xa0 Fast-forward a few weeks -- a few months now -- the President put forward a highly qualified nominee, a nominee who even Republicans admit is a consensus nominee, a nominee who enjoys the support of Republicans like Miguel Estrada, Ken Starr, Michael Chertoff, Alberto Gonzalez.\xc2\xa0 This nominee is someone who has been having private meetings with United States senators, both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings I can tell you have been thoughtful, have been substantive, have been probing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our positon is the following, which is if the senators themselves are going to be in a position to ask questions of our nominee behind close doors and in a private setting, why can\'t we do that in public?\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t Chief Judge Garland have the opportunity to answer these questions under oath, on camera, in the public in a setting that is normally called a hearing?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What sort of a message does it send, though, to go to a state where there\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive Senate election and where you have one of your few Republican allies that this is his home state, the day after endorsing his opponent in that race?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason the President is going to the University of Chicago is he taught there for over a decade, so he\xe2\x80\x99s got deep roots not only in the Chicago area, obviously, but also at that institution.\xc2\xa0 This is an institution that really shaped the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on the importance of rule of law in our country and the fidelity to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I also mentioned, Chief Judge Garland has roots in Chicago, too.\xc2\xa0 So we thought this would be an apt place to have this discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any consideration of not doing the endorsement of Tammy Duckworth within 24 hours of the trip to Chicago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President did decide to endorse Congresswoman Duckworth.\xc2\xa0 He believes she is eminently qualified for the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s a war hero.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s someone who has served in this administration, standing up for veterans. She\xe2\x80\x99s someone who served the people of Illinois in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s proud to support her.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\'t think it says anything to the other Republicans who are deciding what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do about Garland or that you want to switch over to your side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The message I think that sends is just do your job.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not asking for any Senate Republicans to do anything extraordinary, anything creative.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of times where Congress has to face complex, complicated issues -- you might call encryption one of them.\xc2\xa0 This one is fairly simple.\xc2\xa0 This is an elementary responsibility for them to advise and consent on the President\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been back to the University of Chicago Law School since he was a professor there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I did a little bit of digging on this.\xc2\xa0 The President has not been back to the University of Chicago since becoming President.\xc2\xa0 I cannot account for any interim years since leaving the law school and getting to the White House.\xc2\xa0 But I can also tell you this is the 33rd trip to Illinois by the President since getting into the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you one other on something else?\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama think Hillary Clinton is qualified to be President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 The President has said that Secretary Clinton comes to this race with more experience than any other non-Vice President in recent campaign history.\xc2\xa0 The President was fortunate to have Secretary Clinton serve as his Secretary of State for four years, when they worked together on some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most complicated and complex issues.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s proud of that service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what does he make of Bernie Sanders saying that the same super PAC that supported President Obama in 2012 is supporting Hillary Clinton now is a disqualification for her being President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a conversation with the President to read out to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that this is a heated campaign season, and campaigns are going to trade barbs back and forth.\xc2\xa0 And the good news for all of you is those campaigns have highly paid communication professionals who would be happy to answer your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that using a super PAC disqualified him from being President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t talked to the President about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to get us to inversions.\xc2\xa0 The administration had made clear that there would be more inversions rules coming, but the fact that they came on Monday was a big surprise to most everybody, and the markets certainly reacted as such.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, why that timing and why the surprise element, given the pains that this administration and the President often takes to avoid market surprises?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Angela, I don\'t have details of how Treasury went about this process.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is this, as you point out, was the third step they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to try and curb this unpatriotic process.\xc2\xa0 And this began with the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement back in 2014 announcing that he wanted to take on this idea that some large corporate interests could shirk their responsibility to pay taxes to pay their fair share by renouncing their American citizenship.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that\'s an unfair practice and it\xe2\x80\x99s un-American.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why the Treasury has taken some significant steps both in the intervening time, but, as you point out, in recent days to help discourage this action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was the surprise element intended?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to if others found this surprising.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this has been a priority for this President.\xc2\xa0 And I know the Treasury Department has been dogged in their process of putting this together.\xc2\xa0 This is a complicated piece of business, and the Treasury Department wanted to make sure they got it right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How quickly should we expect more rules on inversions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You should check with the Treasury Department. I know that if they\'re working on any future actions, the most impactful thing we could do would be if Congress took some action here.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown -- unfortunately, Congress has not shown a backbone to stand up to large corporate interests that choose to renounce their American citizenship in exchange for tax benefits.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly we should close those loopholes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President directed his Treasury Department to do what they could.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s also why the President wants to see Congress step up to the plate and take some action here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you say how involved was the President in the inversions rule that Treasury just came out with?\xc2\xa0 Like was it something where he was regularly kept up to date by Treasury on how things were proceeding?\xc2\xa0 Or was it something where he really got into the weeds on it, as he sometimes does in issues that concern hi, or that he\xe2\x80\x99s particularly interested in?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, as with all tax guidance or regulation, this is an action taken by Treasury and the IRS.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that Treasury kept the White House up to date as their process proceeded.\xc2\xa0 And ultimately, the President was informed of Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s final decision in the days leading up to the announcement.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, this is absolutely a priority of this President, and that\'s why he called for executive actions a few years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In other financial news, Puerto Rico has decided to enact a debt moratorium.\xc2\xa0 How does that -- or does it complicate the efforts of Washington to right Puerto Rico\xe2\x80\x99s financials?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Angela, we continue to closely monitor the situation in Puerto Rico and the Treasury Department is in regular contact with their government.\xc2\xa0 We know that the commonwealth is in crisis and urgently needs the ability to restructure its financial liabilities, along with independent oversight that respects the commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s governance.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve called on Congress to provide Puerto Rico with tools to achieve a lasting, workable solution and create a path to recovery for the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico.\xc2\xa0 We have been encouraged by the bipartisan progress that\'s being made on the Hill right now.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve expressed some concerns with the legislation as it currently lays out, but our work on that continues in earnest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But will the action by Puerto Rico change anything that Washington is doing now that it appears there may actually be legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the process of that legislation has been underway for a few weeks now and so we hope that that process remains undeterred.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you care to respond to the President of Russia saying the release of the Panama Papers was some sort of U.S.-driven plot to weaken Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea what the President of Russia is basing that on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he need anything?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can only speak for my President, and when the President speaks on highly charged topics, it\xe2\x80\x99s always grounded in facts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. have any inkling that this document dump was coming, or that these reports were about to pop, or anything of that nature?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I can\'t account for the entire enterprise of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that I did not.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President and this White House has had a pretty good working relationship with CEOs of big companies, the kinds of companies that would be concerned by this move.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what kind of response the White House has had from its allies in the business community since Treasury came out with its decision?\xc2\xa0 And do you see this sort of harming the working relationship that the President has with business in the last months of his time in office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, I want to quibble with one premise of your question, which is we think most American businesses want to pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 Most American businesses are headed by CEOs who believe that a tax system -- I\'m sorry -- that they want to pay their fair share.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President believes that under current rules with these loopholes, those who are trying to do the right thing are penalized because there are currently loopholes available to those who are wishing to skirt tax law by renouncing their citizenship and moving their citizenship on paper overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President actually believes that he wants to level the playing field so that all corporations are playing by the same rules.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect him today at all to address his -- Josh said that he\xe2\x80\x99s had regrets over his decision to participate in the filibuster in 2006 against Alito.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect him to address that today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Look, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have -- the President will have a chance to make brief remarks at the top, and then there will be a question-and-answer period with Professor Strauss, President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s former colleague.\xc2\xa0 And then there will be an open Q&amp;A with the audience.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what those questions will be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can that include us?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can that include us as the audience?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Probably not today.\xc2\xa0 But I did want to point out that on Justice Alito, by the way, is a justice and has been for about 10 years.\xc2\xa0 His confirmation battle took 82 days.\xc2\xa0 So the average for a Supreme Court justice is about 67 days from confirmation -- I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try that again -- nomination to confirmation.\xc2\xa0 Sam Alito\xe2\x80\x99s took 82 days.\xc2\xa0 So we expect the Senate to move with expediency, consistent with all of that precedent.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak on how the audience was selected beyond obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re former colleagues of his?\xc2\xa0 There are some both 7th Circuit judges and some local jurists.\xc2\xa0 How were those student selected?\xc2\xa0 Can you just shed any light on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we worked closely with the University of Chicago Law School primarily to put this audience together.\xc2\xa0 There will be current students representing all three years of law school.\xc2\xa0 There will be faculty and there will be members of the sort of greater University of Chicago Law School community.\xc2\xa0 So that includes some alumni, and that includes important partners they have in the greater Chicago community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you we expect some family members of Chief Judge Garland to join us, as well as some of their family friends.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know who among his family?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I know that his sister Jill will be joining us, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more to circle back on the President\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\xc2\xa0 You said she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have any public events, and we wouldn\'t expect her to have any public events.\xc2\xa0 But you speak for the President, so what is the reason that he brought her along today?\xc2\xa0 Does he want her to see where he used to teach?\xc2\xa0 Is there something he wants to impart to her?\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s in the middle of her own college process.\xc2\xa0 Is this part of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President is fortunate enough to sometime have members of his family travel with him.\xc2\xa0 This is one of those trips.\xc2\xa0 His daughter is going to join him on this travel to Chicago and then join us all the way to California.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t expect any public events or any public schedule she has beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
