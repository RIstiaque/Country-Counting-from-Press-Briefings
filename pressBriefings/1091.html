EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Do we have any questions?\xc2\xa0 No questions?\xc2\xa0 I like these kind of gaggles.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to call Netanyahu, by any chance?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any plans to call Netanyahu over the Israeli situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you obviously saw that we put out a statement earlier today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything beyond that statement that we put out from Jay today.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls to read out at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. concerned about the situation in the Sinai, the security situation (inaudible)?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any general comments about the security situation beyond obviously the statement that we put out today, condemning in the strongest possible terms the violence that occurred there today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be having daily economic briefings on this trip?\xc2\xa0 How will he be sort of monitoring the volatility in the markets, the situation in Europe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of his time in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, he will be getting updates from his senior economic team.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next week, Brian Deese, the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, will be traveling to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard and will spend the week there next week.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be providing regular updates and regular briefings for the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in addition to that, we do anticipate that the President will be touching base with the team back home and to the extent that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to read out those calls, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to give you some updates over the course of the week as he does that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to the market swings today and the warnings from Morgan Stanley of a potential recession here and in Europe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, there have been a couple people who have stood on this spot and been asked questions about the markets.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve resisted the urge to comment or speculate on the changes in the markets, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to speculate on those either.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the recession warning, is there a concern that the jobs package you\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed in September will come too late to have any real effect?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What the President is going to put forward in September is a package of new ideas that builds on the ideas that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already been talking about for some time, the kinds of ideas that have bipartisan support, including patent reform; we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the trade agreements a little bit; the President has talked about this idea of extending the payroll tax cut for at least an additional year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there are some new ideas above and beyond that that the President will -- looks forward to talking about in September because, as you pointed out, the -- job creation remains the top agenda on the -- or top item on the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s something that he continues to work on, and he looks forward to the opportunity to talk about those ideas in more detail after Labor Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s your general reaction to some of the criticism about the President taking a vacation now?\xc2\xa0 Was there any consideration to canceling it or shortening it at all, given the state of the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, the President of the United States is the President of the United States wherever he goes.\xc2\xa0 That is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the job that he ran for, that is what the American people expect, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the job that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You saw that John Brennan is traveling on Air Force One with us today.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Brennan, as the President\xe2\x80\x99s top counterterrorism advisor, is traveling on Air Force One, is going to be in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard for the duration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s time there.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is he\xe2\x80\x99ll be providing regular updates to the President to ensure that he\xe2\x80\x99s properly briefed on national security issues.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned that Mr. Deese will also be in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard doing the same thing on the economic side.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President understands that he has important responsibilities to fill, and he -- it\xe2\x80\x99s his job to fill those responsibilities 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, he\xe2\x80\x99s also a husband and a father, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the American people begrudge the President spending a little time with his wife and daughters at the end of the summer before his daughters head back to school.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much time is he going to spend during the vacation working on his speech, the jobs speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mentioned that the President will, over the course of our time in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, will be talking to his economic team, certainly Brian Deese, but other members of the economic team.\xc2\xa0 So I anticipate that this is something that they will continue to talk about. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of you saw on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule that he had a meeting with his senior economic team today in the Oval Office, where they talked about this a little bit as well.\xc2\xa0 So this policy process is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And it is fair to say that he will be in touch over the course of the next nine days talking to his economic team about that speech, putting the policy -- making some policy decisions and preparing for that rollout shortly after Labor Day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us the dollar value of the Syria sanctions announced today?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any update on the situation in Libya, Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s position vis-\xc3\xa0-vis --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 On the dollar value of the sanctions I\xe2\x80\x99d just refer you to the Treasury Department, who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for putting those in place and enforcing them.\xc2\xa0 So they should be able to get you some more detail on that at least. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of Libya, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a direct response for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Syria, some people say that in order for this pressure to be really effective you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get the Europeans to embargo the oil industry or to impose sanctions on the oil industry, as the U.S. announced today.\xc2\xa0 Is the President confident that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get the major European countries to do that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that, based on the statements that you saw not just from the President of the United States but from the leaders of the EU and from Germany and from France and from Great Britain, that there is a united call among those leaders for President Assad to step aside.\xc2\xa0 And that united front is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal efforts on this issue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously in conjunction with the statement that we put out today, we obviously put in place some extremely robust sanctions that will have a very significant impact on the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s ability and on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s regime\xe2\x80\x99s ability to continue to perpetrate the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of actions that -- I should say it this way -- that we do anticipate that the Europeans will be announcing some similar actions soon.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get out ahead of any announcements they have to make, but it\xe2\x80\x99s our expectation that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see an announcement and some actions on their part here soon.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long was this diplomatic push going on to bring these sanctions together?\xc2\xa0 Because there was some talk that you might come out in this last week with a -- can you just talk a little bit about the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A little bit.\xc2\xa0 The hallmark of this process is the President has remained committed to working with nations around the world to present a united front to increasingly isolate the Assad regime and to demonstrate that the international community is on the side of the aspirations of the Syrian people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important part of this -- part of the action that you saw today.\xc2\xa0 And this has been an effort that the President has been personally engaged with.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of the readouts from calls the President has made to his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 And I mentioned the calls to Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Cameron, President Sarkozy.\xc2\xa0 But you also saw over the weekend -- we put out some readouts of calls that the President did with his counterparts in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, in which they discussed this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the diplomatic effort has been a very important part of this story and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s something that will continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the DNC is holding a fundraiser tonight on the Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any campaign-style events or fundraisers planned while he\xe2\x80\x99s on vacation this week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going tonight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the vacation, is it going to be kind of like last year as far as he\xe2\x80\x99s mostly with his family, kind of golfing, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 And how much are we going to see him?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any guidance on that sort of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 I think the activities during this trip to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard will be very similar to the activities from the last couple of years.\xc2\xa0 This is an opportunity for the President to spend a little time away from the spotlight with his wife and two daughters.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for him to play golf, a hobby that he enjoys.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also an opportunity for him to do some of the other things that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him do -- go out and get ice cream and ride bicycles. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comprehensive itinerary for you, but those are the kinds of things that he\xe2\x80\x99s done in the past and we expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do again on this vacation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any early thoughts on the format of the September speech?\xc2\xa0 Is it a primetime address or anything like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do anticipate that over the nine days that -- the course of the next nine days that there will be a lot of legitimate questions like that that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked, but I will say now -- and I suspect it will become a common refrain -- that I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point have any specifics about the content or timing of the post-Labor Day speech. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Okay, all right.\xc2\xa0 Everybody enjoy the rest of the trip, and hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a quiet few days here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 5:02 P.M.
