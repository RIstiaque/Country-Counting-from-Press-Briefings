Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:43 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the delay.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to make, so I will go straight to Julie Pace.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple logistical questions on the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of where the speech stands right now?\xc2\xa0 Is it written?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the President is going to be working on today and over the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is working on the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 He is working with Jon Favreau, his chief speechwriter, as well as many others who are involved in the discussion about policy issues and other things that will be a part of the speech.\xc2\xa0 So that process is underway, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will continue to work on it through the next several days until he delivers it on Tuesday night at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI urge all Americans to tune in.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t tune in on their old-fashioned televisions, they should go to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sotu">www.whitehouse.gov/sotu</a>, where we will have enhanced -- essentially an enhanced version of the speech.\xc2\xa0 It will be live-streamed, but there will be graphics and other details that are occurring live and appearing with the speech that will give viewers who watch it on whitehouse.gov even more information.\xc2\xa0 After that, there will be a live-streamed discussion with -- a panel discussion featuring senior administration officials, and a live audience taking questions from Twitter, Facebook and Google+.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re very excited about all the ways that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to provide access to the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific opportunity for the President to describe his vision for where he believes this country needs to go, for its economy, as well as for its security.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to it, and working on his speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Radio is a good option, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tune in --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- on the radio.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you haven\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to preview the content of the speech, but should we be expecting to hear anything from the White House on the content over the weekend, or really any time before Tuesday night?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if the AP hears about it, can we --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can everybody else get a piece of that action?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Honestly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of plans right now to get into details of the speech before the speech is delivered.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been our approach of late in these major presidential addresses, that our preference is really for the news to be fresh when the President gives a speech.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo how this process works, you can\xe2\x80\x99t always control all the information about something like this.\xc2\xa0 But our hope is that when Americans hear it -- many millions of Americans hear it or watch it or read about it, they will be doing all of that for the first time and learning about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas are, what his vision is, at least as regards the State of the Union address for the first time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just on one other topic, the French have threatened to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan early.\xc2\xa0 How concerning is that to the administration?\xc2\xa0 Have the French communicated any details about what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking at in terms of their troop levels in Afghanistan to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, our thoughts and prayers go out to the French people, and the families of those who lost loved ones in this tragic incident.\xc2\xa0 As you know, four French soldiers perished in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 France is a valued member of the NATO/ISAF coalition, and their forces have served alongside ours with valor and honor.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are in regular consultation with all of our ISAF coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to report to you about those communications with France, except to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very tight coalition and communication is regular and frequent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it concerning that a key U.S. ally in Afghanistan would be discussing pulling its troops out early?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, France has been an excellent and valued member of the NATO/ISAF team.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any discussions or decision that France might make with regard to its presence as part of that coalition.\xc2\xa0 We are -- we -- well, we believe the mission in Afghanistan is very important.\xc2\xa0 The coalition is very important.\xc2\xa0 The President laid out an Afghanistan strategy that he has been executing very deliberately and effectively, and we will continue to focus our efforts on executing that policy that brought a surge in forces that allowed us to focus our efforts on taking the fight to al Qaeda with the goal of disrupting, dismantling and ultimately defeating al Qaeda; with the other goal of stabilizing Afghanistan to give the Afghan government breathing room to help train up Afghan security forces so that we could then draw down our forces as we have begun doing, and transfer security lead to the Afghans by the end of 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that process is in place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a process that we obviously are significantly engaged in.\xc2\xa0 But it includes all of our ISAF partners.</p>\n<p>\n\tReuters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, on Iran:\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any reaction to an ally of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader today calling on Israel to be punished for killing a nuclear scientist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even aware of it, so I have nothing to say about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, on politics, did the President watch the debate last night?\xc2\xa0 And does the President think that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were a little busy last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you were.\xc2\xa0 That voters have a right to know about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was -- we were -- he didn\xe2\x80\x99t watch the debate.\xc2\xa0 As I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed with you before, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- tends not to -- not because of disinterest, necessarily, he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch a lot of television, at least not news television.\xc2\xa0 And I mean no disrespect.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he was -- he had events in New York last night, so -- I think when the debate was occurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even thinking about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The point of the question was not that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- one of the issues that came up at the debate was about candidates\xe2\x80\x99 personal lives.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, does the President think that voters have a right to know about candidates\xe2\x80\x99 personal lives -- for example, Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s -- the allegations by Newt Gingrich\xe2\x80\x99s former wife?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wade into the GOP primary contest and the debates and the issues.\xc2\xa0 The President ran for this office four years ago.\xc2\xa0 He put forward himself and his record and his vision.\xc2\xa0 Voters evaluated his record, who he is and his positions and his vision and elected him to this office.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s running again -- again, on his record and his vision.\xc2\xa0 And voters make their decisions and weigh a lot of criteria, and it would not be for him or for us to tell voters what should matter and what shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But this President is focused on the job he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, the record that he\xe2\x80\x99s compiled, the vision he has for the future.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll be speaking about that within the context of the State of the Union address, the things that we need to do working with Congress, the things that he can do using his executive authority to continue to recover from this terrible recession, to strengthen American security, and to build a foundation for America to, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, win the future, win the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll be up against one of those gentlemen on the stage later this year.\xc2\xa0 Should personal lives be on the agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to weigh into that.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will run his campaign.\xc2\xa0 He, because of the support he has within his own party, is fortunate enough not to face a primary contest.\xc2\xa0 That is a good thing because he has so much work to do for the American people as President.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll engage in the campaign, obviously, as the months pass here with more frequency.\xc2\xa0 And certainly once the Republican Party chooses its nominee, that frequency will intensify.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut right now he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the things that he can do, the things that Washington can do, Congress working with the administration, the things we can do with the private sector.\xc2\xa0 Those will be what he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll let the campaign take care of itself for now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Republican primary process play itself out, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll look to you all to let us know through your reports how that\xe2\x80\x99s going.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWho\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be?\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on the debate.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel at any time that these Republicans have had 16 occasions to take their views to the American people -- does he feel left out of it?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that, gee, I really would have liked to have responded to that comment there or another one?\xc2\xa0 Or is he content getting his message through the way he\xe2\x80\x99s doing it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been invited to these debates.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think the President, President Obama, understands well what this process is like, how challenging it is, what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to engage in debate after debate after debate, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Republican Party process.\xc2\xa0 And he recognizes that that\xe2\x80\x99s a process for each party to engage in as it allows folks across the country, in these states that are participating early on, to make key decisions about who should be that party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tI certainly think he feels that he has ample opportunity to engage with the public to convey what his views are about what policies we should be pursuing, what his views are about the future of the country and his incredible confidence in America and its -- the role it\xe2\x80\x99s going to play as, again, the indispensable nation in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there will be debates.\xc2\xa0 He will be, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, engaged in debates with the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 And that will afford him the opportunity to discuss the issues in a point-counterpoint way.\xc2\xa0 For now, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to focus on his job, which is to be President, to do the things he can do.\xc2\xa0 Because, as he\xe2\x80\x99s pointed out, American political, presidential campaigns take a long time, and we can judge whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing or a bad thing.\xc2\xa0 But we have 10 more months, almost, before Election Day.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and we should not use all of that time simply to campaign.\xc2\xa0 We should -- this President believes very strongly that he will use that time, that he should use that time, and the American people expect him to use that time, to govern, to try to move the ball down the field, if you will, in terms of growing our economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be his primary focus in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he must be aware that everything he does is seen through a spectrum of politics in this year, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly that is a part of this process, and it\xe2\x80\x99s partly because -- and this is not a judgment but an observation -- the media, because of the importance and the duration of the presidential campaign, tends to in an election year view everything that a president or members of Congress does -- a member of Congress does through the prism of politics.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s going to focus what he does on the policy proposals that he can pursue, that he can work with Congress on.\xc2\xa0 We need to, as has been discussed, extend this payroll tax cut to 160 million Americans for the duration of the calendar year.\xc2\xa0 We need to extend unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 There are just many things -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about them on Tuesday night -- many things that we can and should and must do that aren\xe2\x80\x99t about an election campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he looks forward to fulfilling those responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why you run, after all.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why every individual who has found himself in the Oval Office sought that job to begin with -- to pursue a vision and policy goals.\xc2\xa0 And nobody -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, and I certainly know this President didn\xe2\x80\x99t run for this office so that he could run again; he ran for this office so he could be President and do the things he can do to help the country, to help the American people, to grow the economy; to, in the case that he found when he took office, to help stave off a Great Depression; to save an automobile industry that was on the brink of extinction in America; to pass historic health care reform -- a culmination of a 100-year effort to do that; to rebalance and refocus our foreign policy and national security policy so that we took the fight to the enemy that attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, so that -- to end the war in Iraq, as he promised, in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible; to reassert ourselves in the Pacific region, because of the neglect that our foreign policy had experienced while it was preoccupied with Iraq and other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why he ran -- the great opportunity the American people gave him to put his proposals and promises to the test, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to do that throughout this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow on that, please?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You just said there that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use this time, the American people want him to use this time to govern.\xc2\xa0 And yet, last night, he had four fundraisers in New York, he had six I think last week, in D.C. and Chicago.\xc2\xa0 His first TV ad is a million-dollar ad buy; came out yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So how can you continue to present this image that he\xe2\x80\x99s just focused on governing and the campaign is a small part when he\xe2\x80\x99s holding fundraisers left and right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I never said he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t participating in -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about -- we actually bring the press into these fundraisers -- about the fact -- and these campaign events, virtually all; any event where there\xe2\x80\x99s remarks given.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But he has the good fortune of not facing a primary challenge, not having a primary contest.\xc2\xa0 He is -- that allows him to spend even more of his time doing the job that he was elected to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no disputing that he\xe2\x80\x99s governing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that.\xc2\xa0 But can\xe2\x80\x99t you also admit that he\xe2\x80\x99s spending a significant amount of his time campaigning and raising money?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can -- Ed, you seem to want to have a -- make an issue of the fact that we state forthrightly that he has campaign events.\xc2\xa0 As a portion of his time, it is still relatively small.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s in part because he has no primary contest.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also because that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was elected to do.\xc2\xa0 He was elected to be President.\xc2\xa0 And there will certainly come a time, and it will increase gradually as the year goes on, where he engages in more campaign activity.\xc2\xa0 But certainly, relative to the would-be nominees in the Republican Party right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very small portion of his time.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, because that means he can focus on being President and governing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he is fully prepared and looking forward to the opportunity to presenting himself again before the American people; to taking -- presenting his vision for the country, his ideas for where we need to go; putting forward his record of rescuing us from a potential Great Depression; of saving the automobile industry; of passing health care reform; of taking the fight successfully to al Qaeda, and all the other things that have been accomplished in these three years, and presenting it to the American people, and having a debate about it with his opponent.\xc2\xa0 But that time has not come.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing -- on governing.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are having their House -- House Republicans are having a retreat in Baltimore, and one of the things they keep hounding is the Keystone decision.\xc2\xa0 We already know that; they\xe2\x80\x99re upset about it.\xc2\xa0 But moving forward on the governing front, the Republican line now seems to be that they want to bring it back up specifically in the payroll tax cut negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Is that a poison pill for this President, or will you negotiate that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of discussions and negotiations that are occurring and will occur with regards to extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that we anticipate and hope that Congress will, and Republicans in Congress in particular will approve this extension without drama, without arbitrary, ideological fights.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not drawing lines about what --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re calling it an arbitrary, partisan fight.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like you want it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was an arbitrary inclusion in December, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not making -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not negotiating the payroll tax cut extension from here.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I am saying is that I think the American people who were watching this debate in December saw the approach that Republicans took for what it was.\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, because 160 million Americans are depending on this tax cut.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve got it now.\xc2\xa0 They got it for two months.\xc2\xa0 It will mean -- it will do enormous harm to those millions of Americans if it is not extended, and we fully expect that it will be.\xc2\xa0 We fully expect that Republicans and Democrats will come together and pass that extension.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlexis, you moved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just trying to keep you on your toes.\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions to follow up on what you were just talking about with campaign events.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe afternoon event today is closed in D.C.\xc2\xa0 Can you -- first, can you just describe what that event is and why it\xe2\x80\x99s closed and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to attend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get details for you.\xc2\xa0 But as is the case -- and I just mentioned this to Ed -- that we provide I think pretty extraordinary access to the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign events.\xc2\xa0 When there are no formal remarks given I think that\xe2\x80\x99s when we -- the events are closed press.\xc2\xa0 So that would be the case today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question is, just recently there was an article that stated flatly that President Obama is opposed to the pro-Obama super PAC that is working to raise money.\xc2\xa0 And could you just clarify his feeling about a super PAC being out there raising money to support his reelection?\xc2\xa0 Is he actually opposed?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct, he\xe2\x80\x99s opposed to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the article.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember the article that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.\xc2\xa0 I think our position on Citizens United is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on Citizens United is very clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would have to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what it is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We opposed the decision.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not healthy for the system.\xc2\xa0 I think you know that.\xc2\xa0 But thanks for asking.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details for you on it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him.\xc2\xa0 But our views on the system that has created this situation are pretty clear.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to follow up, has he ever suggested that he would prefer that that group -- and he knows them well --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that conversation with him, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- there is, as is the case by law, there\xe2\x80\x99s no coordination, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Do you folks not see the optics of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys get that you\xe2\x80\x99re totally obsessed with campaign politics now, right, even though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a primary contest?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it an obsession, but do you not understand the optics of it --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I get it.\xc2\xa0 I did it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s fun to cover the campaign, sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you not understand the optics when the President -- the economy event -- he was on the ground in Orlando for, I believe, less than three hours, yet he spent roughly seven hours at these four different campaign events.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the way that this is viewed, you hear from Republicans --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I would challenge you to look at what the President does on any given week, including this week and many weeks going backward, and not come to the conclusion that he spends a relatively small amount of time at this stage on campaign events.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a simple fact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, his would-be challengers are spending all of their time.\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been spending many years exclusively on this while he\xe2\x80\x99s been here governing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the system works.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact that, yes, he had a number of events last night in New York, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And not just last night, I mean, there are other times when he goes on the road.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same kind of thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I get that.\xc2\xa0 But again, I challenge you to look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule and not come to the conclusion, the factual conclusion, that at this point in the campaign he is -- partly because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a primary contest -- obviously, if he did, he would be out more and engaging in that primary contest as previous incumbent presidents have had to do -- because of his broad support within his own party, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he is making the appropriate use of the extra time that affords him, which is to focus on governing; to focus on engaging with Congress to do things to grow the economy and create jobs; focusing on the things he can do independently like the announcements he made yesterday about the executive order and initiatives to significantly expand tourism, a vital industry in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he was doing yesterday in Florida.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep doing that, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s what he believes is important, and at this stage in the campaign he can do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a status update on same-sex marriage, where the President is on that evolving process?\xc2\xa0 And what is he doing to assist that evolution?\xc2\xa0 Does he meet with people?\xc2\xa0 Does he read books?\xc2\xa0 What is he doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important in this, as part of my answer here, to just remind you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on these issues -- ending \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and on marriage in particular having the federal government stand down from -- or his administration stand down from defending DOMA, believing that it\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutional and working to have it repealed.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s personal views I will leave for him to describe.\xc2\xa0 But this administration, his administration\xe2\x80\x99s record on these issues that are very important I think are pretty clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no movement at this time?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will leave it to him to describe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same answer I have given in the past to Chris, for example, who has his hand raised.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve deprived him of the opportunity to ask it today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, I have a follow-up question to that.\xc2\xa0 Can I jump in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Chris, how are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m doing good.\xc2\xa0 How are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Very well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A number of state legislatures in the coming weeks, including those in Washington State, New Jersey and Maryland are going to try to push for same-sex marriage legislation in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 I know you said you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk specifics about the State of The Union address.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you could rule out the possibility of the President completing his evolution and endorsing marriage equality next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will not rule anything in or out.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to talk about, beyond pointing at his words, his personal views on this.\xc2\xa0 I think his administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies on related issues are there for people to judge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did watch the debate last night.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How was that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They painted a picture of America --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I heard it was pretty entertaining.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At times.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I followed it a bit on Twitter in between events, as a casual observer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So one could, after watching that debate, have a view of America.\xc2\xa0 What is the state of the union today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you should stay tuned to hear the President deliver an address to the nation from Congress at 9 p.m. on Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the President believes that this country suffered an economic body blow the likes of which it had not encountered -- suffered from since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s indisputable.\xc2\xa0 The facts make that clear, and I think that any discussion with any American who\xe2\x80\x99s been affected by the Great Recession would reaffirm that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is also true is that because of who we are as a country -- the fact that we always get up when we\xe2\x80\x99re knocked down, because we have the best workers, the smartest workers in the world, and because of the measures that this President, working with Congress, took to halt an economic collapse and to reverse it, this country is stronger now than it was when he took office, both economically and in terms of its national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On national security.\xc2\xa0 The President said last night -- you used it again today -- that he has restored the United States as the \xe2\x80\x9csole indispensable power in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The United States was not that four years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think is indisputable -- and I would refer you to the reports that you and your colleagues made regularly at the time -- is that the United States, prior to President Obama taking office, was viewed very differently than it is now, by allies and partners around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, Iran is a very good example of an approach that this -- an issue to which this President\xe2\x80\x99s approach has changed that dynamic in a way that has allowed the United States to lead, not just unilaterally, but to lead other nations towards historic and unprecedented sanctions and pressure on Iran, so that it is now clear to the world that the issue is not -- the problem here is not the United States, it is Iran and Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that was not the way the world, unfortunately, viewed it back in 2008.\xc2\xa0 He has, through ending torture, I believe, he believes, done something that was absolutely the right thing to do, and improved the way the United States is viewed around the world.\xc2\xa0 Because we are not only strong, but we have incredibly strong values, and we conduct ourselves accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the context in which he was speaking.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward, as I think he said in a recent interview, to having a debate about foreign policy as well as domestic policy when the time comes.\xc2\xa0 I was looking to Ed, but he\xe2\x80\x99s stepped away.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll have that debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the topic of national security, yesterday, as you know, you just commented on the President announced that he wants to speed up the tourist visa process in certain countries, as well as expand the Global Entry program.\xc2\xa0 What kinds of measures are in place to make sure that this process doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compromise national security in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we provided a lot of information about that yesterday, Kristen.\xc2\xa0 And what absolutely remains as true today as it was prior to this week and this announcement by the President, is that our security remains our number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 What the President directed through the initiatives that he announced yesterday was for various agencies to take steps to streamline the visa applications in certain cases, in certain countries; to take other measures to make it easier for tourists to visit the United States and enjoy what this great country has to offer; and to, by doing so, help create American jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut all of that is done with an absolute eye to the paramount concern, which is security.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you for details to the Departments of State and Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Jay, on Syria, one activist in Syria was quoted in a newspaper saying, \xe2\x80\x9cUntil now, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a civil war, but if the international community continues like this, just watching and doing nothing, there will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to those words?\xc2\xa0 And does this steady drumbeat of people calling for a Libya-like intervention, is that making the administration reassess its stance right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would make two points.\xc2\xa0 One, the international community is not standing by.\xc2\xa0 The international community has, with American leadership, taken action to pressure and isolate Syria, and that is having an obvious effect as the Assad regime loses control of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same type of intervention that we had in Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same situation.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, each country affected by the so-called Arab Spring is different, and circumstances are different in each country, and circumstances are different with regards to how the region views these developments.\xc2\xa0 So there is not a one-size-fits-all approach here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you is that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s fall is inevitable.\xc2\xa0 It is clear that his regime is no longer, as I said, in full control of the country, and that it is only taking Syria toward a dangerous end.\xc2\xa0 There have been defections of senior military officials and a parliamentary representative recently.\xc2\xa0 And those are just additional data points that demonstrate the momentum and how it continues against Assad and his regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe stand with the Syrians who want to have a transition in their country so that Syria can be democratic and prosperous.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to work with our international partners to enhance the pressure on Assad to do the right thing and step aside.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could try just one more on the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t preview specifically what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in it.\xc2\xa0 But to what extent will it include different ideas or themes than those that we heard during the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Osawatomie, Kansas?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there will be thematic consistency between not just what the President said in Osawatomie, but what he has been saying since he began his campaign for this office back in 2007.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there will be news in the speech.\xc2\xa0 There will be new ideas.\xc2\xa0 And going to I think Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question to start off the briefing, we are hoping that those will be -- the newness of those ideas will be preserved for him to announce them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about some kind of framework?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is keenly focused, as you know, on doing everything he can to ensure that every American gets a fair shake and a fair shot; that we rebuild this economy in a way that ensures that everyone plays by the same rules so that opportunity is available to everyone; that Wall Street, for example, plays by the same rules as Main Street; and that we grow as a nation together, that we expand access to the middle class and expand security for those who are already in the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat dynamic that has existed now for, by some measures, 30 years and certainly intensively for the decade before this President took office, has to be broken.\xc2\xa0 The middle class has been under intense pressure in that decade prior to President Obama taking office.\xc2\xa0 Middle-class incomes stagnated or declined.\xc2\xa0 And at the same time, the wealthiest 1 or 2 percent of the country saw their incomes expand greatly, and their share of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth share greatly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on this is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about we need to, as a country, to ensure that we are the most powerful economy, the most innovative and sophisticated; the job-creating engine that this economy needs to be.\xc2\xa0 We need to make some very important investments in education, in infrastructure, in research and development.\xc2\xa0 And in order to do that we need to make sure that everyone pays their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that goes to I believe the point about the theme, one of the themes from the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Osawatomie.\xc2\xa0 And as you have heard since that speech and certainly predating it, but since that speech you will continue to hear that theme.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Online piracy bills up on the Hill were put off and votes were postponed on SOPA today until there can be some consensus.\xc2\xa0 Christopher Dodd, in a New York Times piece yesterday, was suggesting that perhaps the White House should hold a summit to bridge the gaps and so forth.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House think of holding a summit on online piracy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we made our principles clear about these issues over the weekend and this week.\xc2\xa0 We believe that online piracy is an important issue and a problem that needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a legislative solution to that that Congress can find.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for both sides on this issue to come together and work out that solution that both deals with online piracy and continues to ensure a free and open Internet.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we call on and are encouraged by indications that this -- that others believe this should happen, too; that the stakeholders in this issue who have, on all sides, very legitimate concerns work together to find what we believe is a legislative compromise.\xc2\xa0 But it has -- everybody has to be in on it for it to work and get through Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could that be aided by a summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think it can be -- we have laid out our principles, which we hope will be looked to as a guide for that process.\xc2\xa0 But I think this is a legislative process that folks on the Hill can take up, working with those with strong opinions on both sides of the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may, one other question on the foreign affairs front.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the reports about Brennan helping look for a place outside of Yemen for Saleh?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 Our view of this issue hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 We remain focused on achieving a peaceful political transition and helping the Yemenis hold a presidential election in February that will begin a new chapter in that country\xe2\x80\x99s history.</p>\n<p>\n\tMost of the questions I get about this are in terms of Saleh\xe2\x80\x99s visa application.\xc2\xa0 There have been no changes in that.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- I have no information, or no knowledge, about that question that you asked.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Wolf.\xc2\xa0 And then Ann.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned before -- thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned before use of executive authority in the context of the State of the Union speech next week.\xc2\xa0 Last year it was his first speaking to a partially Republican Congress; this year he\xe2\x80\x99s got a partially Republican Congress in an election year.\xc2\xa0 He can\xe2\x80\x99t be expecting much in the way of legislation.\xc2\xa0 Will he sort of talk about, if you won\xe2\x80\x99t work with me, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep doing this alone?\xc2\xa0 Will he mention the \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d campaign that he\xe2\x80\x99s on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question, because I think that we disagree with that premise that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done just because it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the American people want that to be true or would be happy if that were true.\xc2\xa0 And Americans of all political persuasions are going to want their elected representatives here in Washington to work together, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s an even year or an odd year or a year in the presidential cycle.\xc2\xa0 They want progress.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t want members of either party to throw up their hands and say, we can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xc2\xa0 And they don\xe2\x80\x99t want what -- based on one report I read, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think, to hear from one party -- which is, again, referring to one report from the House Republican caucus -- declare that the year is all about challenging the President instead of getting things done.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we believe that there is opportunity, and there could be more opportunities this year to achieve things with Congress, Republicans and Democrats working together in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 I think there are historic examples that actually contradict the assumption that you can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done in a presidential election year -- 1996 comes to mind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will -- this President will try, he will put forward ideas both in the State of the Union address and continue to press ideas that he put forward last fall -- the kinds of ideas, referring to those provisions of the American Jobs Act that haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet passed, that on their face are bipartisan in nature.\xc2\xa0 Their pedigree is bipartisan in nature.\xc2\xa0 And they should enjoy bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to press for that.\xc2\xa0 And there is reason to hope, at least, that members in Congress -- and I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking here about Republicans who blocked those provisions of the American Jobs Act -- will view things a little differently this year.\xc2\xa0 Not just because passing those provisions would be good for the country, good for the American people, good for their constituents, but may be good for them politically.\xc2\xa0 And then, boy, is that a win-win-win situation, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tSo hopefully that will happen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- this President is not going to assume that nothing can get done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it does sound like he\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring up the other side, which is, if not, then --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But he has been doing that all along.\xc2\xa0 Well, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not in the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about using his executive authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to preview specifics.\xc2\xa0 He has been talking about the fact that he will use his executive authority to advance the priorities of the American people, and he has been doing that.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 It is true that the context here is often, we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress to act, and that will be true throughout the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut where Congress will act, he will eagerly join with them to get the people\xe2\x80\x99s business done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 David Plouffe did just get specific on the State of the Union with mayors saying that the President will present what he called a blueprint for the middle class, specifics on how to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, to lay out a blueprint for the middle class in this address coming up?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s all that specific, Ann.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, I mean, his whole agenda has been a blueprint for the middle class and it will be going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe American Jobs Act is an economic proposal designed to help the middle class, give it more economic security; return teachers to the classroom and construction workers to infrastructure projects; give 160 million Americans, essentially middle-class Americans, a tax cut for the entire calendar year; provide unemployment insurance to those hardworking Americans who are unemployed but looking for work and who need that assistance to help themselves and their families.\xc2\xa0 And that money itself then provides a boost to the economy.\xc2\xa0 So you will hear more ideas from him about how to assist the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s vitally important to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he practiced at all or will he this weekend?\xc2\xa0 How many drafts has he gone through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specifics on drafts.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, there is a speech that\xe2\x80\x99s being worked on.\xc2\xa0 The President is very engaged in that process, as he always is.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re at a stage yet where he\xe2\x80\x99s practicing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good at giving speeches, so when it comes together I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to deliver it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more -- oh, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even -- two more, since I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- introduce yourself and then --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m David Welna with NPR.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about Israel.\xc2\xa0 I was at the RNC\xe2\x80\x99s winter meeting last week in New Orleans.\xc2\xa0 And they in general assembly passed unanimously a resolution that says, \xe2\x80\x9cpeace can be afforded to the region\xe2\x80\x9d -- referring to Israel -- \xe2\x80\x9conly through a united Israel governed under one law for all people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a clear departure from a two-state solution that has had bipartisan support up until now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to venture too far into analyzing what it means within the context of an approach that both sides in the Middle East peace process believe is the right approach to the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 So this President\xe2\x80\x99s position, in keeping with his predecessors, his recent predecessors, is that the way to achieve a two-state solution, which both parties want, is through face-to-face negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we commend the Jordanians, the King of Jordan in particular, for overseeing the resumption of talks.\xc2\xa0 This is a very challenging issue.\xc2\xa0 If it weren\xe2\x80\x99t, it would have been resolved probably a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 This President is committed to continuing to work on it.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly believes that it is profoundly in the interests of both the Palestinians and the Israelis to achieve that two-state solution that gives Palestinians sovereignty and gives Israel the secure Jewish state that they need and deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of pursuing a two-state solution, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSorry, Victoria, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the classified coalition report on the animosity between Afghan soldiers and U.S. soldiers and coalition soldiers, there have been 26 attacks by Afghan soldiers on coalition forces in the last four years; of course, as we saw, four French killed today.\xc2\xa0 It says that these are not isolated incidents; in fact, saying that -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve made your pronouncement to the contrary -- it seemed disingenuous, if not profoundly intellectually dishonest.\xc2\xa0 Is it --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you\xe2\x80\x99re reading -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re reading from.\xc2\xa0 So I can tell you that there is no indication that these incidents are linked or part of any larger coordinated effort, but ISAF is closely examining the incidents and has taken steps to improve the vetting process.\xc2\xa0 As the NATO Secretary General pointed out in his statement on the incident, every day, 130,000 ISAF troops from 50 nations fight and train with 300,000 Afghan soldiers.\xc2\xa0 I think ISAF has more details.\xc2\xa0 But you opened up by saying this was a classified report, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not familiar with the quote you gave, and if it were in fact a classified report I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking about it from here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you read The New York Times --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do read The New York Times.\xc2\xa0 One day, I will remember.\xc2\xa0 But I have it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSchedule for the week of -- well, Victoria, my response to your question and to that article is what I just said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The schedule for the week of January 23, 2012, is as follows:\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 He might even be putting the finishing touches on his speech.\xc2\xa0 Actually, that will probably happen Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 Tuesday evening, the President will deliver his State of the Union address at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\xc2\xa0 Following the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address, he will begin a five-state, three-day swing across the country.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, he will begin his trip with an event in the Cedar Rapids area, followed by an event in the Phoenix area.\xc2\xa0 He will then travel to Las Vegas, where he will spend the night.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will hold events in the Las Vegas area and the Denver area before traveling to Detroit that evening, where he will spend the night.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the President will hold an event in the Detroit area before returning here to Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is your week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 I hope you all join us next week.\xc2\xa0 It will be fun.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have a nice week.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
