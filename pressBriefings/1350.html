BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I want to start with a statement about the attack in Afghanistan today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reminded again this morning of the great sacrifice that our troops and their families are making, and our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those we lost.\xc2\xa0 While our troops are fighting for a better future for the Afghan people, the Taliban offers only destruction and they have so little respect for humanity that they would murder Afghan civilians waiting for a bus.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Afghan government remain steadfast in our determination to build security, stability, and opportunity for Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We are confident that the legacy of our troops\xe2\x80\x99 extraordinary sacrifice will be an America that is stronger and more secure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s from the President or you?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s just me.</p>\n<p>You guys should have the background on the event in Youngstown.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that being released on the ground in the same way?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that will be out by the time we get there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it sure will -- do you mean the statement or do you mean --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The statement.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just me.\xc2\xa0 The background, however, everybody should have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the sanctions, the U.N. sanctions, what are going to be the targets for those sanctions?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re working through the diplomatic process on that and more information will be available later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 But the ultimate target is to stop Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapon program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking banks, shipping -- can you say anything there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all going through the normal course of diplomatic process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they decided yet?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a strong draft already in agreement by the P5-plus-1 that\xe2\x80\x99s being worked through the process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a formal timeline of when the President is going to announce the independent commission?\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s going to sign an executive order.\xc2\xa0 Do we expect that today, tomorrow?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would expect that in coming days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This week?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Potentially.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say something about what the President hopes to accomplish with the Mexican visit?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There should be some more information on this this afternoon, but the visit of President Calder\xc3\xb3n to the United States is one in which the President -- the two Presidents will help to strengthen the strong bond between the two countries.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about a wide variety of shared interests like immigration, security, the economy, and other such issues.\xc2\xa0 But he just looks forward to having such a strong ally here at the White House to strengthen our bond.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the Brazilians have said that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to get into the P5-plus-1 talks with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. view on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get to you when we get on the ground.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has spent a lot of energy and time engaging Turkey and Brazil.\xc2\xa0 Is there any irritation at all that those two countries appear to be complicating one of the most prominent U.S. foreign policy goals?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you saw what Secretary Clinton said at the hearing, her view is that they acted in good faith.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately our goal here is to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody who follows this issue was surprised, to see that Iran was doing something that could help forestall sanctions against them.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the answer to that effort yesterday is this strong agreement that we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached with the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to apply pressure in every way that we can.\xc2\xa0 We started with unilateral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working on multilateral sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue until Iran lives up to their international obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any opinion or thoughts about Richard Blumenthal apparently misrepresenting his non-existent Vietnam record?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know if we put out any comment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the Jeremiah Wright letter that\xe2\x80\x99s floating out there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments and the comments of his campaign are all still there to see on Google for the last couple of years, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave it to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve previously said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been I think an increase in some of the hostile rhetoric towards BP coming out of Congress, accusing it of negligence, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 How does the administration feel about having BP as a partner in this cleanup effort?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does the administration still feel that BP is doing what it needs to?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, our view is that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose any partner for this catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve done is worked with the responsible party to do everything we can to stop oil from leaking from the bottom of the Gulf and to mitigate the environmental disaster that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the water right now.</p>\n<p>We are obviously working with BP because, frankly, they have the equipment that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary in order to get down to the bottom of the Gulf to help plug that hole.\xc2\xa0 And in places where we think we need to make changes or do different things, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them on that.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working very hard, but the priority right now is plugging that hole and cleaning up the oil.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President invite Jewish lawmakers to meet with him these evening?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is a meeting where the President is going to -- which the President requested, where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about some of the important issues to the strong supporters of Israel and Congress, such as proximity talks and Iran and things like that.\xc2\xa0 It also offers a forum for them to ask questions of the President on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on issues of interest to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, is he going to be kind of unveiling some new policy or anything like that to them before --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that.\xc2\xa0 This is more of a check-in and update.</p>\n<p>Carol, you got anything back there?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You have any questions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Bill.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Buckle up.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:25 P.M.
