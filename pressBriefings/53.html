Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:07 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Hope you all had a wonderful weekend. \xc2\xa0I do not have any announcements to begin, so we can go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKathleen, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I\'m going to start with the Supreme Court decision or non-decision on the contraceptive agreement. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if you view this move as a clear result of the vacancy on the Court, and if you have any thoughts on whether or not you think the Court is intentionally dodging contentious issues at this point. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by saying that we obviously were pleased with the announcement from the Supreme Court today. It will allow millions of women across the country to continue to get the health care coverage that they need. \xc2\xa0So this obviously is an outcome that we are pleased to see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur concerns about the continued vacancy on the Supreme Court persist. \xc2\xa0In this case, based on, again, the announcement from the Supreme Court, it\'s not obvious that an additional justice would have yielded a different result, but I haven\'t heard anybody make the argument that leaving the Supreme Court of the United States short-staffed is somehow good for the country. The argument that we\'ve heard from Republicans is that they don\'t want to confirm another of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nominees to the Supreme Court, and they have made that declaration based solely on partisan reasons. \xc2\xa0And many Republicans are having a tough time explaining to their constituents why they refuse to do their job simply because the Republican leader in the Senate has requested that they do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are Presidents in both parties that made a strong case for the Senate fulfilling their constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0And it was President Reagan who observed that a protracted vacancy on the Supreme Court didn\xe2\x80\x99t serve the American people well. \xc2\xa0And President Obama has made exactly the same case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And as for the substance of the issue, are you confident that the administration and these groups can come to some sort of compromise at this point? \xc2\xa0Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise to be had?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what is true is the administration has put forward an accommodation that ensures that women, nationwide, have access to health care, including contraceptive coverage -- without pay, I might add -- while also protecting religious liberty. \xc2\xa0And we were pleased to announce this accommodation and to demonstrate that we were committed to both principles.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is there may be another process that plays out, because ultimately that was the announcement that\'s been remanded to lower courts. \xc2\xa0And we\'ll obviously continue to engage in the process. \xc2\xa0But we obviously are pleased that the announcement today from the Supreme Court protects the ability of millions of women nationwide to continue to get access to their health care.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And switching topics. \xc2\xa0On Libya, the announcement out of Vienna that the U.S. is backing the decision to lift the embargo and start arming the government there. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if -- obviously this has been a decision that the U.S. was reluctant to make because of the concerns of these weapons falling into wrong hands, so I\'m wondering if you could speak to why you\'re confident now that the government there can control some of these arms at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think my understanding of the way that this process is working is that Government of National Accord that the international community has come to rally around is now in a position to make a specific request of weapons that they would like to see provided to forces in Libya that are fighting ISIL and securing the country. \xc2\xa0And the United Nations will review that request and determine whether or not that is a request that can be agreed to in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exacerbate our concerns that those weapons could fall into the wrong hands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is the beginning of the process, not the end of it. But it is an indication that the international community is coming together in support of the Government of National Accord in Libya that\xe2\x80\x99s seeking to bring some long-sought political stability to that country. \xc2\xa0Libya has encountered some significant challenges. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey had an authoritarian dictator that ruled that country for more than four decades that eroded almost all of the remaining institutions that typically are needed to govern a country. \xc2\xa0And it means that the Government of National Accord is essentially having to come in from the bottom up and start building the infrastructure of a government to rule a country that\xe2\x80\x99s got a significant economy, particularly based on the natural resources that they can sell on the global market, and a populace that has been divided along tribal lines for a long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is a difficult challenge. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the international community to come together in support of this Government of National Accord so that the Libyan people can finally have the kind of government that reflects their preferences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But as a sign of -- a vote of confidence in this government, should we expect that then, particularly in the campaign against ISIS, that the U.S. and the coalition will start to be more engaged in Libya? \xc2\xa0Should we expect more Special Operations or airstrikes, or is this sort of the first step towards an increased involvement in Libya on that front?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ultimately, our goal would be to build up the capacity of the Government of National Accord so they could begin doing this work of fighting ISIL and securing their own country themselves. \xc2\xa0That ultimately is the goal, so that the United States and the rest of the international community doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to come in and fight this fight for them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, as I mentioned, they are doing some very basic work that -- to sort of build up the institutions of that country. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a lot of broader international support in order for them to succeed in that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the United States has already taken military strikes against ISIL targets in Libya, and when necessary, to take additional strikes to protect the American people, we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to do so. \xc2\xa0So back in November, as a result of a U.S. military airstrike, there was -- the leading ISIL figure in Libya was killed. \xc2\xa0There was another strike that was carried out earlier this year that removed a number of ISIL fighters from the battlefield. \xc2\xa0These are fighters who we were concerned were prepared to go out and carry out a large-scale operation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve used -- the President has ordered military action in Libya against ISIL targets in the past, and that continues to be an option. \xc2\xa0But that is not a substitute for building the capacity of a central government in Libya that can begin to secure that country and begin to take the fight to ISIL in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick one on the House invitation for Ben Rhodes to appear tomorrow. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been suggestions that he may not appear. \xc2\xa0Could you tell us definitively if he will not appear tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tim, the answers that you heard from me before are still operative here. \xc2\xa0The truth is, it is Republicans in Congress who criticized the Iran deal, who have got a lot to explain when it comes to saying things about the Iran deal that didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out to be true. \xc2\xa0And if they want to hold a hearing to determine whether or not Republicans were just wrong and badly misinformed, or if they were purposefully lying to the American people, then they can do that. \xc2\xa0There obviously would be ample time -- at least they should set aside ample time, because there are any number of witnesses, including individuals who serve on the committee, who could provide some significant insight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think what\xe2\x80\x99s true is, Tim, that previous administrations have been fairly skeptical of these kinds of efforts, particularly because this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a whole lot more than just a three-ring circus that Republicans are looking to organize up there. \xc2\xa0And so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for you. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to review the letter, but I think you can sense the not-so-thinly-veiled skepticism about this whole exercise that I\xe2\x80\x99m displaying here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But to be clear, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a definitive answer for you. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a definitive answer for you. \xc2\xa0Anything else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. Trump is saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to have a good relationship with Britain\xe2\x80\x99s David Cameron. \xc2\xa0Does this have any -- does this jeopardize the relationship the United States has with Britain?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the individual presidential candidates express their own views about what they hope to do to strengthen our alliances around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident Obama, obviously, over the course of his tenure in office has invested deeply in our alliances around the world because of the important benefits those alliances bring to the American people, both in terms of economic security but also when it comes to our national security. \xc2\xa0And the President has invested deeply in the special relationship that the United States and the UK have enjoyed for centuries, and the President certainly believes that that\xe2\x80\x99s an alliance that\xe2\x80\x99s worthy of an investment.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday at Rutgers, we saw the President criticize policies of a certain Republican, one by one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Jim Inhofe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, not that one. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh, okay. \xc2\xa0Well, he was the only one that was specifically mentioned in the speech.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s policies, is this kind of a signal that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President open up a little bit more?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mr. Trump wasn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned in the speech, though, Tim. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Mr. Inhofe was, though. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0Is it likely we\xe2\x80\x99ll see --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to illustrate here is that this is a -- the concerns that President Obama raised were not new but are concerns that extend broadly throughout the Republican Party. \xc2\xa0The President talked a lot about the continued insistence by Republicans to deny the fact of climate change in the face of overwhelming evidence and already-observed impacts. \xc2\xa0Republicans continue to deny that this is even taking place, and the President highlighted the example of Senator Inhofe, in the middle of winter, bringing a snowball to the floor of the United States Senate, and suggesting that somehow this confirmed his denial of science. \xc2\xa0Even years later, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain exactly what he was trying to illustrate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that difficult, however, to make clear what the President was trying to illustrate, which is that our country has long benefitted from political leaders that are not seeking to deny evidence and facts and science in order to advance a political agenda, but actually to focus on evidence and science and facts to make an argument about improving the country and moving the country forward and living up to the values that we have long fought for. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are not new arguments that President Obama has made. \xc2\xa0For example, the President talked about the fact that, \xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest challenges we face cannot be solved in isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I know that many of your colleagues, Tim, suggested that that might have been a shot at one presidential candidate or another. \xc2\xa0The truth is, that sounds like just a few more words for \xe2\x80\x9cyes, we can.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech is these are values that he fought for as a candidate for President and that he has spent the last seven and a half years fighting for in office. \xc2\xa0This has been his approach to problem-solving. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been his approach to leading the country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been his approach to leading the world. \xc2\xa0And the country and the world are better off for it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one more on the speech yesterday. \xc2\xa0While he didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name, he did go after the wall policy and he did go after the temporary ban on Muslims. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious whether we might hear more from the President on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of women.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Tim, there are a variety of Republican candidates and a variety of Republican officeholders who have suggested that a religious test should be imposed on individuals seeking to enter the United States. \xc2\xa0And for the reasons that the President outlined in the speech, that is inconsistent with our values and it\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with a smart strategy to destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0So, again, this is not an argument about one presidential candidate; this is an argument about many leaders in a political party that have eschewed evidence because it is inconvenient to the political argument that they want to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s particularly dangerous when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something like the national security of the United States and the danger that the Republican strategy poses to our efforts to coordinate with Muslims in America and Muslims around the world to fight ISIL. \xc2\xa0Those are some of our most important partners. \xc2\xa0And to alienate them is unwise, to put it mildly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You mentioned being satisfied with this ACA decision, the status quo is intact. \xc2\xa0But isn\xe2\x80\x99t this disappointing that it\xe2\x80\x99s going back and, at the very least, will probably lead to a compromise that is less than what you originally would have liked to have seen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, we were gratified by the ruling today. \xc2\xa0And this announcement does ensure that millions of women across the country can continue to have access to their health care. \xc2\xa0And it is a reflection of something that we have long believed, which is that it is possible to prioritize both access to health care for everybody while protecting the religious liberty of every American. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what we sought to do, and we obviously are pleased that this is something that will continue to remain in effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Things could change at the lower court level, though. \xc2\xa0And I mean, in terms of trying to find a compromise, that could morph in a way that you might not agree with, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the process is going to play out so we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And seeing how this was the result of an evenly divided Court, and looking at how this could have gone another way if the President had a nominee that was accepted prior to this, so do you expect this to just solidify opposition to taking up Garland? \xc2\xa0And I mean, in a sense, Republicans could see this as the status quo working for them in some ways. \xc2\xa0Do you feel like that\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have no idea what Republicans will conclude. \xc2\xa0The truth is, all the Democrats and at least a couple of the Republicans have concluded that Chief Judge Garland, the most experienced Supreme Court nominee in American history when you consider his 19 years of service on the federal bench, is somebody who is deserving of a fair hearing and a yes-or-no vote. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s even Republicans who have described him as a consensus nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I did take note of something that Leader McConnell said last week that in some ways I think actually makes the case as strongly as anything that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to come up with. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell, speaking on the floor of the House of -- or I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, of the United States Senate -- and this is not something that we had to dig into the archives on and find on C-SPAN from three decades ago but rather something that he said last week. \xc2\xa0Senator McConnell: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic work of government this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSome have said that because it is an election year we can\xe2\x80\x99t do much. \xc2\xa0I would like to remind everyone that we have had a regularly scheduled election in this country every two years since 1788 right on time. \xc2\xa0I heard some people say we can\xe2\x80\x99t do it because we have an election next year, and others have said we can\xe2\x80\x99t do whatever it is because we have an election this year. \xc2\xa0We have elections in this year right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our work.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I think Senator McConnell said it quite well. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Now that we have sort of the fruits, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing this happen now that we only have eight people on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So how big of a concern is it that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see this happen again and again?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think it is unclear exactly what role the protracted vacancy on the Supreme Court had on this -- the outcome here, in part because the announcement reflected the unanimous view of the justices. \xc2\xa0Now, would they have been able to cobble together a different agreement if Justice Scalia were still alive and serving on the bench, or if Chief Judge Garland had been confirmed as he should be to the Supreme Court? It\xe2\x80\x99s very unclear exactly what the difference would be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think what is undeniable, though, is that even Republicans have failed to make any sort of coherent case that the American people are better served by having a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That flies in the face of certainly the argument that President Obama has made. \xc2\xa0It also flies in the face of the argument that President Reagan has made. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to overcome. \xc2\xa0And the truth is I think this is the -- this underscores the discomfort, the obvious discomfort, that Republican senators have shown in trying to defend their position. \xc2\xa0The fact is, there\xe2\x80\x99s no good justification for allowing this vacancy to persist. \xc2\xa0And it is simply a result of Republican senators refusing to do their job, and refusing to do their job at the specific request of Leader McConnell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not exactly sure exactly what the broader Republican aim is, particularly when you consider the views of most Republican senators about both presidential candidates. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s something for them to explain.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And speaking of presidential candidates, Bill Clinton as economic czar for Hillary Clinton -- is that a good thing for Democrats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Democrats will have to decide. \xc2\xa0Ultimately this will factor in, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, into the decision that some Democrats will have to make in terms of choosing a nominee. I think what I can just say generally is I think those of you who remember -- and I think -- believe at least some of you in here covered the 2012 Democratic convention down in Charlotte -- you may remember a speech that former President Clinton delivered on national television in which he articulated an economic strategy and an economic vision entirely consistent with what President Obama has fought for in his seven and a half years in office. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the results speak for themselves. \xc2\xa0They certainly spoke volumes in evaluating President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. They also speak volumes about the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in this country over the last seven and a half years of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office, even -- again, after all, Leader McConnell himself said it best when he acknowledged that our country was better off -- is better off now than we were when President Obama took office. \xc2\xa0And a lot of that is because of the economic strategy that President Obama has pursued to grow our economy from the middle out, to be focused on the middle class, to be focused on job creation, and to be focused on the future of our economy that will be critical to our long-term success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, in the aftermath of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives last week on transgender rights, one issue that remains is the ban prohibiting transgender people from serving openly in the armed services. \xc2\xa0Last week, Secretary Carter said the issue was complicated, which was detailed in a Washington Post report over the weekend on agreements on lifting that ban. \xc2\xa0Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House apply the same standard on the Pentagon for transgender access as it has done for education, health care and bathroom use?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, I think that we have long acknowledged, even on issues that are relevant to the LGBT community, that ensuring the effective implementation of policies at the Department of Defense has higher stakes than it may in other government agencies. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about our basic national security. \xc2\xa0And what the Secretary of Defense has concluded -- and the President agrees -- is that qualified American citizens should not be denied an opportunity to serve their country just because of who they are or who they love. \xc2\xa0Our national security is enhanced when we can draw upon the skills and expertise and patriotism of every American. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what motivated Secretary Carter to conduct this review and seek the smooth implementation of a policy that would allow transgender Americans -- again, who meet the relevant qualifications -- to serve our country. \xc2\xa0But the smooth and effective implementation of this policy is not insignificant. And what Secretary Carter and the other services are conscientiously moving forward to do is to figure out the best way to settle on a policy and implement it effectively and as expeditiously as possible. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what they continue to work on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last week you said that the President was regularly updated on the developments of the joint guidance for schools on transgender students. \xc2\xa0Is the President receiving the same kind of updates with regards to the military service guidance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President does have a regular opportunity to meet with the Secretary of Defense in the Oval Office when they both happen to be in town. \xc2\xa0It happens once or twice a week -- I\'m sorry -- once a week or once every two weeks. And the President is updated on a range of issues that Secretary Carter is focused on. \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to read out the details of every conversation that they have, but it\'s fair for you to assume that in those conversations the President is kept apprized as necessary of the progress of this review.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One such meeting is going to take place this afternoon, according to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0Will the President, during this meeting, call on the Secretary to move forward with the conclusion of this review?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, the President -- again, I\'m not going to walk through the agenda for their meeting, but the President continues to have confidence that the Department of Defense is handling this review as conscientiously as they should.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOlivier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, is the President proud of his Syria policy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, I think the President is certainly pleased that the Syria policy that he has put forward \xc2\xa0-- and he\xe2\x80\x99s confident that the Syria policy that he has put forward and pursued has advanced the national security interest of the United States. \xc2\xa0What is also true is that we\'ve seen terrible violence in Syria; it\'s an awful humanitarian situation and it\'s a genuine human tragedy. \xc2\xa0And it\'s a dangerous place and it\'s a place that poses a heightened risk to the United States and to our allies and interests around the world. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\'s why the President and his team have spent so much time focused on how to confront that risk, how to counter that risk, and how to work with the international community to ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0But there is no denying that what has happened in Syria has changed millions of lives, and not for the better. \xc2\xa0And that\'s a testament to the failed political leadership of Bashar al-Assad. \xc2\xa0It\'s a testament to the way that the political chaos in that country has propagated so much violence, not just in Syria but throughout the region. \xc2\xa0And people fleeing that violence have gone to far-flung countries around the world in a way that has been genuinely destabilizing to some of the countries where they\xe2\x80\x99ve sought refuge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the long-term consequences of what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in Syria are serious, but the President does believe that the way that he has handled this situation is entirely consistent with our national security interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when Ben Rhodes tells Syria activists we are not proud of our Syria policy -- is that a fair characterization of how the White House views its own policy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Olivier, again, I can\'t speak to any of that conversation. \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there for that conversation, so I don\'t really know the context in which it came up. \xc2\xa0But I think the description that I have just put forward of the situation in Syria and the way that the President has focused on our interests in that situation are consistent with the way that Ben views that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And at the risk of giving everybody whiplash, in the GQ interview, the President was asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever said, give me the JFK assassination files, I want to read them, give me all the secret stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d and the President says, \xe2\x80\x9cI got to tell you, it\'s a little disappointing. \xc2\xa0People always ask me about Roswell and the aliens and UFOs, and it turns out the stuff going on that\'s top secret isn\'t nearly as exciting as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Why not make it public?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\'t looked at the documents, so it\'s unclear to me exactly what the equities might be. \xc2\xa0So maybe at the next news conference you can have the opportunity to ask the President that yourself -- which would be interesting. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tByron.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Reuters is reporting that the U.S. is planning to make some changes in boosting investment and trade in its sanctions regime against Burma -- Myanmar. \xc2\xa0Can you explain what those changes might be and why they\xe2\x80\x99re being implemented?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any announcements about our sanctions against Burma at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously those are maintained by the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll keep you posted if we have any changes to announce.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s schedule this week -- can you give us some detail?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Judge Garland -- Chief Judge Garland is heading back up to Capitol Hill where he\'ll have a series of meetings this week. \xc2\xa0He\'ll be meeting tomorrow with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \xc2\xa0On Wednesday, he\'ll have a meeting with Senator Hirono of Hawaii and Senator Udall and Senator Murphy. \xc2\xa0And on Thursday, he\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with Senators Merkley and Heinrich. \xc2\xa0So that is another six senators -- all Democrats this week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No Republicans? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meetings that he has coming up with Republicans this week. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has there been any response to the questionnaire that was handed in last week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we did make note of the fact that this is a question that was a questionnaire that was accepted by Republicans and I believe posted on the committee website. \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that at least the American public now has access to even more evidence to illustrate why the President has chosen Chief Judge Garland to assume the important responsibility of serving a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We have a team that\xe2\x80\x99s been doing some reporting about the number of Americans who are involved in ISIS, trying to join, being recruited, so on and so forth. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, how big a problem does the administration see this as -- Americans -- I think the number is about 250 -- who have tried to join. \xc2\xa0There are a few dozen who have made it to Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0How serious is that part of the problem?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about our counter-ISIL strategy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about the military aspect of that strategy, particularly as it\xe2\x80\x99s focused on taking ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0And that obviously is an important priority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut another key priority in which the administration has deeply invested is countering violent extremism and countering the efforts of ISIL to radicalize vulnerable populations around the world, including inside the United States. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked diligently with community leaders across the country, include in the Muslim community, to counter the strategy that we know ISIL has, which is to recruit people from around the world to do one of two things -- to either carry out attacks where they are or travel to Iraq and Syria and take up arms in that region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an issue that we take quite seriously. \xc2\xa0The good news is that when you consider the success that ISIL has had thus far in radicalizing Americans to their cause, that the percentage of people -- based on the sizeable population of the United States -- is much lower than it has been in other countries. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a product of hard work, and we remain vigilant in countering those efforts because we understand the potential negative consequences of failing in that effort.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand there are investigations going on in just about every state. \xc2\xa0Does that sound about right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about any ongoing investigations. \xc2\xa0You can always check with the FBI about that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And have you been able to develop a sense of who are the most -- is there a group, a region, a category of people who you think are most vulnerable to this? \xc2\xa0And is there any more specifics about what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, or what law enforcement is doing, or what anyone is doing, for that matter, to try and combat this particular -- is the phenomenon getting smaller, bigger? \xc2\xa0Just trying to get a bit more about just how big a problem this is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Ron, I think as even your network\xe2\x80\x99s reporting shows that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the people from all walks of life are potentially vulnerable to this kind of radicalization; that it\xe2\x80\x99s not focused on just one region of the country or on one specific community. \xc2\xa0And in some ways, that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes them so dangerous. \xc2\xa0This is a pretty amorphous effort that they have undertaken. \xc2\xa0Obviously they are able to use social media to interact with the world and that poses some significant challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur countering violent extremism efforts are actually based over at the Department of Homeland Security, and they are focused on understanding the way that ISIL has used social media in particular to try to recruit people. \xc2\xa0We have worked hard to lift up the voices in the Muslim community that can effectively counter the radical ideology that\xe2\x80\x99s being propagated by ISIL extremists. \xc2\xa0But we can certainly get you a more comprehensive rundown from the Department of Homeland Security about what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to counter these efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about a development out of the Treasury Department today that certainly had some coordination with the White House in one of the implications for White House policy. \xc2\xa0The Treasury Department had disclosed that Saudi Arabia now holds $116 billion in U.S. debt. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is it now going to be going forward -- the government\xe2\x80\x99s policy to release the Saudi data rather than keep it secret, as it had been for a few decades? \xc2\xa0And do you have a handle on whether that is the full extent of Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s treasury holdings? \xc2\xa0There had been a New York Times report that there was something like $750 billion in play that the Saudis were going to pull back if that bill went forward. \xc2\xa0Part three of my one-subject question is what\xe2\x80\x99s the state of play now with that legislation? \xc2\xa0Are you working actively to try to head this bill off? \xc2\xa0Is there actually a veto threat out there now? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the state of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, for the technical aspects of the report from Treasury in terms of what their disclosure schedule is moving forward, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s a shift in policy. \xc2\xa0I mean, you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the Department of Treasure has indicated that that was the case. \xc2\xa0And those of you who follow these reports closely noticed the difference. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that somehow that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a change in policy, but for how that policy will be implemented moving forward I encourage you to check with the Treasury Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the latest legislative proposal from Congress as it relates to Saudi Arabia, but obviously the concerns that we have with the way that it was written when it was presented last month are still significant and I know that there has been some talk on Capitol Hill about potentially revising that legislation, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where that effort stands at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you speak to the question of whether that $116 billion is comprehensive, or are you referring that to Treasury?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I encourage you to check with Treasury on that as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I toss out a Vietnam question?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit from the podium about how the President wants to mark the legacy of the Vietnam War when he goes and about this idea of him being at war longer than any other U.S. President -- largely because of issues that he inherited -- how he will address that broader topic in Vietnam particularly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, last week, the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor had an opportunity to meet with Vietnam War-era veterans and veterans service organizations to talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for any American President to go to Vietnam without acknowledging the history between our two countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe truth is, there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole generation of Americans that proudly served this country in Vietnam. \xc2\xa0And I think the mistake that most Americans if not all Americans acknowledge that was made in this country at that time is that there was a tendency to allow political concerns with American foreign policy to interfere with showing respect and gratitude to fellow Americans who had put themselves in great peril to serve the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think this President, like many Americans, is determined to make sure that that never happens again. \xc2\xa0And so I think you can anticipate that on his trip, the President will acknowledge that history but will do so with the courageous service of hundreds of thousands of patriotic Americans in mind.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAndrew.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, do you have a reaction to the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of a state of emergency?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that announcement from President Maduro. \xc2\xa0Obviously the reporting, particularly just over the last couple of days about the situation in Venezuela is breathtaking. The conditions for the Venezuelan population are terrible. \xc2\xa0And obviously we continue to be quite concerned about the wellbeing of the people of Venezuela. \xc2\xa0And we stand with the international community in expressing that concern. \xc2\xa0But the solution to these challenges will require the inclusion of all interested parties. And now is the time for leaders to listen to diverse Venezuelan voices and work together peacefully to try to find solutions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the failure to do that only puts hundreds of thousands if not millions of Venezuelans at risk of further suffering.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to ask a couple of questions on two different subjects. \xc2\xa0One, ACA. \xc2\xa0With the months that you have remaining here at the White House, what are the lessons learned when it comes to ACA? \xc2\xa0I mean, you had the ruling today and then also last week you had another one about subsidizing insurance or subsidizing co-pays for some of the people who wanted it. \xc2\xa0So what are some of the lessons learned?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think certainly one of the lessons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republican critics of the bill is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to stop at nothing to try to tear this bill down. \xc2\xa0But I continue to be confident that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to fail. \xc2\xa0And as it relates to the district court ruling that we saw last week, it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Republicans have even resorted to getting taxpayers to foot the bill for their political efforts. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think even some Americans who might be skeptical of the impact of the Affordable Care Act I don\xe2\x80\x99t think would appreciate that their taxpayer funds are being used in this way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we continue to have a lot of confidence in the power of the legal arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for some time. \xc2\xa0I think at this point the Justice Department has built up a pretty effective track record for our success in protecting the Affordable Care Act so that millions of Americans can get access to the health care that they\xe2\x80\x99ve long been denied. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a legacy that President Obama is quite proud of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the President himself -- early on, critics were saying things needed to change, and the President said he welcomed ideas about how to tweak it. \xc2\xa0Looking back, what are some of the areas beyond the Supreme Court issues -- or maybe even with the Supreme Court rulings -- that you would tweak in these waning months? \xc2\xa0And also, is there a fear that once this administration is over, number 45 comes in, that things could be different for ACA?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, at this point, we\xe2\x80\x99re quite proud of the record of the ACA. \xc2\xa0Every single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy has created private-sector jobs. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good track record, particularly when you consider that Republicans, even six years later, try to describe that bill as a job-killer. \xc2\xa0At some point, somebody is going to call them out for, again, either being wrong or lying. \xc2\xa0But there will be ample time for that, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe legacy of the Affordable Care Act is 20 million more people now have access to health care that didn\xe2\x80\x99t before, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0The growth in health care costs is lower than it\xe2\x80\x99s ever been in the history of tracking that measurement; that\xe2\x80\x99s more than 50 years now. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important -- to say nothing of the benefits that millions of Americans who had health insurance before the Affordable Care Act now enjoy because of the patient protections that are included in that legislation. \xc2\xa0No one in America can be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition. \xc2\xa0Every child, every young adult in America is eligible to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health insurance until they turn 26 because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tA whole range of preventative services are now available to Americans for free because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a legacy. \xc2\xa0And that includes millions of Americans that think that they\xe2\x80\x99re unaffected by the Affordable Care Act because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t had to go and purchase insurance through the exchanges, but yet they benefit in ways that have a profound impact on their family\xe2\x80\x99s budget and on their health.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is a piece of legislation that the President remains intensely proud of. \xc2\xa0And the legacy of this legislation is a stronger economy and a country full of citizens whose health prospects are enhanced because of this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And with that issue of high deductibles for some of these insured -- is that anything that could be tweaked or looked at or viewed through a microscope? \xc2\xa0Because some people have complained about higher deductibles through this process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, April, this is an argument that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for six years. \xc2\xa0The health insurance market is a lot better for private citizens now than it was before the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact. \xc2\xa0And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that Republicans like to deny, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the truth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And my last question. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s this increased interest in Roswell. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re doing your dance at the podium about it. \xc2\xa0Is there a such thing? \xc2\xa0Are you -- look at you, you\xe2\x80\x99re drinking so you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to think. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Is there a such thing -- are you keeping quiet because of security concerns? \xc2\xa0I mean, are we to think that there might be life beyond here? \xc2\xa0I mean -- seriously. \xc2\xa0I mean, you need to answer this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, April, there are some questions that even the White House Press Secretary doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have answers to, and this is one of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get off easy like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Well, you keep trying. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on the question about Ben Rhodes and the possibility of making him available for Congressman Chaffetz. \xc2\xa0To just clarify, if nothing else, is it your opinion that his appearance would be, if nothing else, instructive, if not enlightening?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have all of the available evidence that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to evaluate who was telling the truth on the Iran deal and who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0There are members of the committee who are not telling the truth on the Iran deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, if they want to hold a hearing, and they think it would be useful to get to the bottom of why they were so wrong about the Iran deal, then they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do that. \xc2\xa0They can start by swearing in Ken Buck, Congressman from Colorado, I believe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned Tom Cotton, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a lot to say. \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get some pretty tough questions about all the things that he said about the Iran deal that didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out to be true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Absolutely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Everything that Ben Rhodes said about the Iran deal did turn out to be true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So then wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be at least instructive, if not enlightening, to have him go ahead and testify?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a fair deal for people who lied about the Iran deal to question the people who told the truth? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a very American approach to these kinds of things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I thought you suggested on Thursday that it would be a good idea to get to the bottom of it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting that I think, based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve reported -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you talk about this at length in some detail -- it would seem to help to get to the bottom of it if Ben Rhodes were part of the conversation. \xc2\xa0Would you agree?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, Ben Rhodes is the person who told the truth about the Iran deal, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who are either badly misinformed or outright lying about the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0And so if they want to explore that, they are welcome to do that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand why getting to the bottom of who lied about the Iran deal requires somebody who told the truth about the Iran deal to participate. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s just swear the liars under oath and let\xe2\x80\x99s see what they have to say for themselves. \xc2\xa0Maybe they can explain why they were so wrong about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to live up to the commitments that they made in the context of the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0Maybe they can explain why they said that Iran would never agree to the Iran deal in the first place, even though they did. \xc2\xa0Maybe they can explain why our international inspectors have been able to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the deal. \xc2\xa0Maybe they can explain why they said Iran, in the case of Steve Scalise, would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief as a result of the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrong on just about every measure. \xc2\xa0So if they want to talk about that, and they want to come clean to the American people about what was going on when they weren\xe2\x80\x99t telling the truth about the Iran deal, then they\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do that. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the person who told the truth about the Iran deal needs to be a part of it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick clarification. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting that Senator Cotton should lie, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I am suggesting that what he said about the Iran deal did not turn out to be true. \xc2\xa0And so was he wildly misinformed, or was he not telling the truth? \xc2\xa0Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll answer the committee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You think it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0But the fact is he, time and time again, presented a wide range of information about the Iran deal that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not just a conjecture, tha\xe2\x80\x99s something that we know as a fact. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking for the actual quotes here, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I want to make sure we get this right. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe said -- this is Senator Tom Cotton on Meet the Press. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s television footage of all of this. \xc2\xa0He said that \xe2\x80\x9cThis deal gives them $150 billion of sanctions relief.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Not true. \xc2\xa0He was wrong about that. \xc2\xa0He said \xe2\x80\x9cIt puts them on the path to be a nuclear-weapon state in eight to 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Not true. \xc2\xa0In fact, we will be able to verify over the course of the next 10 years and beyond that they are not advancing toward a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And because this deal went through, they are farther away from having access to a nuclear weapon than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in about eight to 10 years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to re-litigate the conversation. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there would be more clarity if a guy of Ben Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s information and knowledge -- intimate knowledge of the details, if that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be helpful. \xc2\xa0And if it would be, why not make him available?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess part of the reason is that there are administration officials who, on countless occasions, have traveled up to Capitol Hill to participate in hearings about the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0There have been literally dozens of congressional engagements about the Iran deal since January of 2015. \xc2\xa0The most recent example of this -- you have actually the person who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of implementing the Iran deal under Secretary of State Tom Shannon, who appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and he appeared there solely to discuss Iran and the Iran deal.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, in fact, the House Foreign Affairs Committee held an open hearing with the coordinator from the Department of State on this question back in February. \xc2\xa0I guess my point is -- and I guess the other metric here that I think is relevant is that the administration has provided classified briefings or appeared at open hearings to discuss the Iran deal more than 30 times in just the last 18 months. \xc2\xa0So if it were a matter of just one hearing that would convince Republicans to stop lying or to at least start telling the truth when it comes to the Iran deal, then presumably that would have happened in one of the first 30 or so meetings that we had with them. \xc2\xa0I\'m not sure the 31st hearing in 18 months is going to get them to straighten up and act right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0Can you give me an accurate number of detainees at Gitmo? \xc2\xa0I\'ve asked you I think once a week for the last five weeks, and previously you were super specific -- you said there were 98, or 104. \xc2\xa0But lately you\xe2\x80\x99ve been sort of kicking the can a bit, saying, I\'m not sure, I\'ll get back to you. \xc2\xa0No one has gotten back to me. \xc2\xa0Can you give me a specific number of detainees? \xc2\xa0And if you have any announcements about potential transfers that are --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Somebody will get back to you today, I assure you of that. \xc2\xa0I\'m not really sure why that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- those numbers are surprising --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I will. \xc2\xa0It\'s not a surprising number. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s the other part of this. \xc2\xa0Every time there\xe2\x80\x99s a transfer we announce it publicly. \xc2\xa0So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a change to that number since the last time that we spoke, that\'s something that you would have seen because we do make an affirmative public announcement every time that that happens. \xc2\xa0But I will make sure somebody follows up with you today to give you the specific remaining count.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The chair of the House Appropriations Committee has introduced a bill for $622 million to fund Zika. \xc2\xa0It\'s all out of existing money and it comes with the statement again that the administration has failed to answer -- repeatedly failed to answer questions about where and how the money would be spent. \xc2\xa0Is it enough money? \xc2\xa0And are there questions you haven\'t answered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, not that I\'m aware of, because I do continue -- while sometimes I don\'t have the Gitmo guidance that Kevin is looking for, I have made a habit of bringing this with me. \xc2\xa0This is the letter that was sent by the White House to congressional leaders on February 22nd, detailing exactly how our $1.9 billion appropriations request should be used to protect the American people from the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHere we are, almost three months later, and we hear that some House Republicans have gotten around to considering a piece of legislation that is only about a third of what our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some money spent already, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, not because Congress did anything. \xc2\xa0There have been some funds that have been reprogrammed by the Centers for Disease Control and a couple of other health care-related agencies that have been devoted to this effort. \xc2\xa0But that is essentially the bureaucratic equivalent of digging through the sofa cushions to try to come up with the necessary money. \xc2\xa0So the truth is our public health professionals shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reduced to doing that when it comes to something as critically important as protecting the American people from the Zika virus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, the thing that I will say is that at some point this summer -- and we\'re probably not that far off from it -- there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be widespread public reporting about the threat of the Zika virus, and there will be questions, I\'m confident, in this room by all of you, wondering why the federal government didn\xe2\x80\x99t more effectively plan to protect the American people from the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0And my answer then will be, we\'ve been trying. \xc2\xa0The President held a meeting on this back in January. \xc2\xa0The President made clear the first week in February that we were going to have a specific request for funding. \xc2\xa0The administration put forward that specific request just a couple of weeks later in the form of the letter that I just held up. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve not seen Republicans act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I don\'t really know what the explanation is for that. \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really aware of the fact that there was a partisan difference about the need to protect the American people from Zika virus.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The chairman is saying you still haven\'t provided full accounting of justification for the request. \xc2\xa0And given the lack of complete information, independent determinations on necessary funding levels have not been made. \xc2\xa0Any future funding now has to wait, he says, until the fiscal year 2017. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\'t think that\'s going to be a satisfactory explanation to the American people when they see that pregnant women and babies across this country are at extreme risk because of the Zika virus. \xc2\xa0The truth is our public health professionals have had many conversations with members of Congress about what exactly is needed. \xc2\xa0There are countless letters that have gone back and forth, including the first one that I just held up from February 22, 2016. \xc2\xa0So if there was something in that February 22nd letter that Republicans in Congress didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t they pick up the phone on February 23rd and ask about it? \xc2\xa0Waiting a day to deal with an emergency situation seems like -- I guess it\'s a legitimate question. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut here we are, three months later, and Republicans are making bureaucratic excuses about why they are not dealing with what our public health professionals say is a genuine emergency. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing. \xc2\xa0It\'s not just scientists and it\'s not just Democrats at the White House who have raised these concerns. \xc2\xa0I began my briefing one day last week by reading a letter from the bipartisan group of governors all across the country who are deeply concerned by congressional inaction and Republican obstruction to needed Zika virus funding. \xc2\xa0And we haven\'t gotten it, and the American people I think are rightly concerned about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, is it going to require the onset of that emergency before Republicans act? \xc2\xa0I sure hope not, but that\'s the direction it seems to be trending.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJuliet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, in terms of the nationwide guidance on \xc2\xa0transgender students that the administration put out last week, you and others have described it as a response to school administrators on the state and local level who were asking for clarification. \xc2\xa0And I assume there was some consultation with those officials. \xc2\xa0I was interested into what extent the administration, the Education and the Justice Departments consulted with top state elected officials in forming that guidance, whether anything was done on that front.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I\'d refer you, actually, to my colleagues in the Department of Education and they can talk about the sense of outreach that they did to develop this policy guidance.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, the thing that I would just point you to is that the way that we can tell there was extensive outreach is that the guidance that was produced included essentially case studies of the way schools all across the country have dealt with this particular challenge. \xc2\xa0So those ideas didn\xe2\x80\x99t just materialize, they were a result from intensive consultations by the Department of Education to educators and community leaders all across the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut for the details of those conversations, I\'d refer you to the Department of Education. \xc2\xa0Maybe they can provide you some more information about who exactly they consulted. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President has now been at war longer than any U.S. President in history. \xc2\xa0Does the President or the White House have any reaction to that unexpected element of his legacy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\'m not sure I would describe it as unexpected. \xc2\xa0I think those who listen carefully to the President\xe2\x80\x99s arguments as a candidate for President understood that he believed that the United States had been distracted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and had not been sufficiently focused on going after al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why President Obama ramped up the commitment that the United States made to decimating core al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \xc2\xa0And that was a mission that was carried out under very difficult circumstances by courageous members of our armed forces. \xc2\xa0And they succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda in that region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what we also knew was likely to happen is that the threat from al Qaeda elements around the world was likely to be more diffuse. \xc2\xa0And we do continue to be concerned about dangerous al Qaeda elements in other countries. \xc2\xa0The dangers that they pose is different than the danger that was posed by core al Qaeda, but they are dangerous nonetheless. \xc2\xa0And the President has been vigilant about countering those extremist organizations, ordering the military to take action against them -- to take military action against them, all in the name of trying to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the success that our country has had in fighting core al Qaeda and in protecting the American people and in intensifying our ability to work with our allies around the world to do that is an important part of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0I just want to follow up on Juliet\xe2\x80\x99s question about the transgender guidance, as well. \xc2\xa0You said last week that this was not a direct response to what happened in North Carolina and the legislation there. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about whether you think that influenced the process at all? \xc2\xa0In other words, were you hearing from more educators, more folks who had been following this issue because of the public debate over that law, and some of your own Cabinet members were actually coming out and saying that there was a risk of North Carolina endangering its own funding?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the scrutiny around this issue was increased dramatically after states like North Carolina took the steps that they took. \xc2\xa0I know that there was a referendum that was considered by voters in the city of Houston, I believe last fall, around a similar question. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that in the last several months there has been increased public awareness of dealing with this issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo what precise impact that had on the process, again, I think I\'d refer you to the Department of Education, because ultimately they were the ones who were formulating this policy guidance and they were on the receiving end of people seeking the guidance. \xc2\xa0But I\'ll just go back to where I started, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that there has been a significant uptick in public consideration of these kinds of questions, and that included a broader public consideration of what kinds of policy responses were available to school administrators and local elected officials. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is a challenge that many of those school administrators are dealing with across the country, and the desire on the part of the Department of Education was to empower those school administrators with more information and more good ideas about what steps they can take to protect the safety and dignity of every student at their school. \xc2\xa0That ultimately is the goal of administrators who are seeking to nurture an inclusive environment where their students can learn and get the best possible education. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Education is obviously fully supportive of that goal, and that\'s what motivated them to share this guidance last week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To your knowledge, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any effort by the White House to say, we know this policy was under consideration, now it\'s time to move forward with it? \xc2\xa0Because there have been activists who have been asking for this for quite a long time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There have been. \xc2\xa0But, look, this is a policy process that was the responsibility of the Department of Education. \xc2\xa0They obviously had to work closely with the Department of Justice because there were important legal questions that were raised. \xc2\xa0And as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, the White House was not just aware of these policy deliberations, but in the loop as decisions were being made to ensure that the guidance reflected the President\xe2\x80\x99s values and the President\xe2\x80\x99s preferences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re obviously aware that this issue has created a lot of discussion around the country. \xc2\xa0Over the weekend, you heard some praise for the administration; you heard a lot of outrage as well. \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned that you\xe2\x80\x99ve given the Republican base a campaign issue here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not surprised to hear -- or I was not surprised to see that there were Republican politicians who were seeking to use this as a political tool. \xc2\xa0And I think this goes to the core not just of what we were talking about in this room on Friday, but it goes in part to what the President was talking about in his commencement address at Rutgers on Sunday, and that is simply this: \xc2\xa0People who serve in government have a responsibility to look out for the best interests of the American people and to ensure that our values are reflected in the way the country is governed. \xc2\xa0And too often, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency on the part of politicians to cynically use these kinds of decisions to score political points and to slice and dice the electorate. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe truth is school administrators across the country are dealing with an actual dilemma that has consequences for the safety and dignity of every student at their school. \xc2\xa0So when the response from politicians is just to use rhetoric that\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at scoring political points, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t protect any students\xe2\x80\x99 safety or dignity. \xc2\xa0What those school administrators need is practical advice. \xc2\xa0They need the legal interpretations. \xc2\xa0They need good ideas that have been used by school administrators around the country to address this challenge. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what was provided by the Department of Education, and they did that in spite of the cynical political gamesmanship of a lot of Republican politicians across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned the issue of safety. \xc2\xa0Can you explain why the administration moved relatively quickly on this issue, which carries the potential loss of federal funding, when, in contrast, on the issue of sanctuary cities, the administration, for eight years, has not threatened to take away a city\xe2\x80\x99s federal funding for harboring dangerous illegal immigrants?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think, as -- again, as we pointed out and discussed on Friday, there were requests for this kind of guidance that had been coming to the Department of Education for more than a year. \xc2\xa0And so I think that there were many school administrators who had been waiting a long time and urging the Department of Education to provide this guidance. \xc2\xa0I think they would have liked to have seen it arrive even more quickly than it did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to keep track of the various proposals around sanctuary cities that have been put forward by Republicans. \xc2\xa0But the truth is, and the irony about this, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who blocked comprehensive immigration reform legislation. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little rich for Republicans to block the solution and then blame the President for not punishing cities who are dealing with the problem. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, I think that actually is maybe even a better example of Republicans eschewing common-sense solutions because it might interfere with their ability to deliver a persuasive political message. \xc2\xa0And again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s relevant to a lot of what the President had to talk about in Rutgers yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Groups of people like the Little Sisters of the Poor are saying that the return of the case to the 11th Circuit Court from the Supreme Court actually strikes down several of the key decisions it had made that hurt their case, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t really precedent for the Supreme Court to do such a thing. \xc2\xa0So how can you say that you\xe2\x80\x99re gratified by the ruling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The announcement from the Supreme Court today ensures that millions of American women all across the country will continue to enjoy the health care coverage that they have sought. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased about that because we care about making sure that women have access to the health care that they want.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe also care about making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the religious liberty of all Americans. \xc2\xa0And we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the appropriate balance that our policy has struck. \xc2\xa0And we were pleased to see that the Supreme Court didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike that down. \xc2\xa0And that has preserved women\xe2\x80\x99s access to health care and it\xe2\x80\x99s preserved the protections for religious liberty that this administration has prioritized.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Women\xe2\x80\x99s groups are saying that now they have to wait. \xc2\xa0So the decision isn\xe2\x80\x99t really final. \xc2\xa0Now they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to wait for more -- for that health care.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I acknowledge that, but while we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting, millions of American women all across the country will continue to enjoy the access to the health care that they and their doctors determine that they need.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, the federal judge declared that the Obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money to subsidize health insurers without obtaining an appropriation from Congress. Then hospital insurer stocks dropped -- the unanticipated costs of providing health care to customers on the states online exchange has prompted large insurers to seek rate increases. \xc2\xa0United Healthcare pulled out of Maryland. \xc2\xa0So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you say there\xe2\x80\x99s a negative trend happening with the law?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think that the positive trends are undeniable. \xc2\xa0Every single month since President Obama signed that bill into law, our economy has created private sector jobs. \xc2\xa0That happens to be the longest streak of private sector job growth in American history. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 20 million more Americans get access to health care because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0No longer can a single American be discriminated against because they have a preexisting condition because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0Every young adult up through age 25 is able to stay on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0Women can\xe2\x80\x99t be discriminated against just because they\xe2\x80\x99re women because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And millions of people across the country have access to a health insurance market that forces insurance companies to compete for their business, and that has led to better health care available at better costs for people who don\'t get their health insurance through their employer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll of these are important positive benefits that are a direct result and part of the design of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last statistic I\xe2\x80\x99ll share in some ways is the most important one, that we\'ve actually seen the growth in health care costs held to the lowest level on record because of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0And keeping those costs -- or that growth in costs low has a positive impact on our economy, has a positive impact on the bottom line of businesses large and small. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt has a positive impact on the deficit -- all things that are important to this economy. \xc2\xa0And that\'s part of why the President made this issue a priority -- not just because of the moral question about whether or not having access to health care is a right. \xc2\xa0The President believes that it is, that every American is entitled to access to quality health care, but also because resolving this problem in the right way can be good for our economy and yield important economic benefits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd after six years, it\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable that that\'s been the case. \xc2\xa0And that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped -- as I mentioned earlier, that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped Republicans from resorting to all sorts of wild strategies to try to undermine the bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI suspect the reason they\'re trying to undermine the bill is because they all opposed it. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty cynical view on their -- a pretty cynical tactic on their part to try to undermine a bill that they opposed. \xc2\xa0Maybe that helps them justify why they opposed it, is if they can find a way to tear that law down and say, see, we told you it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the truth is they\'ve been unsuccessful in that effort. \xc2\xa0There have been previous occasions where people have gotten excited and hope that, oh, well, maybe this will finally be the legal death blow to the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0They\'ve been wrong every single time. \xc2\xa0And as it relates to this specific case, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident they\'re going to be wrong again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSarah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0At the beginning, you suggested that the press too narrowly interpreted the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday in hearing them as being about Trump. \xc2\xa0You said they\'re about the Republicans more generally. \xc2\xa0At the same time, we\'ve seen a lot of coverage kind of suggesting a lot of ways that Trump doesn\'t fit with GOP orthodoxy. \xc2\xa0So could you just articulate kind of the key areas where the White House sees Trump and the GOP as being in lockstep?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys talk about Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to be focused on what the President believes is important for the American people to consider as they head to the ballot box in November. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to make that case in public will become more frequent when we actually are in the general election stage of the campaign. \xc2\xa0We\'re getting close to that, but we\'re not there yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President will have an ample opportunity to weigh in and make his case that the President who succeeds him is a President who is committed to building on all of the success that we\'ve enjoyed over the last seven years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee at this point. \xc2\xa0Why not use his name? \xc2\xa0And once he really -- assuming he does ultimately, officially have that title of nominee, will we hear the President speak about him by name, or in a more specific way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as you pointed out, the President has on occasion spoken directly about his candidacy or some of this statements on the stump. \xc2\xa0And I suspect the President will do that again in the future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut just in terms of people trying to understand exactly the message that the President was delivering to the Class of 2016 at Rutgers, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to understand the broader argument that the President was making. \xc2\xa0This is central to not just his presidency over the last seven years, but also central to the promise of his candidacy back in 2007 and 2008.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable consistency to the President\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy for these kinds of issues and a remarkable consistency to the President\xe2\x80\x99s arguments. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for that not to be lost in the swirl of the ongoing presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been consistent discussion among Republicans down ballot about whether they should or could run against Trump or distance themselves from Trump. \xc2\xa0The way the Republican Party is right now, can people down ballot, or especially in the Senate do that authentically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I would just note the difficulty that many candidates have encountered in trying to do that. \xc2\xa0I know at least one candidate tried to draw a distinction between supporting a candidate and endorsing a candidate. \xc2\xa0If that\'s the best they\'re going to be able to do, then I wish them luck.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:23 P.M.
