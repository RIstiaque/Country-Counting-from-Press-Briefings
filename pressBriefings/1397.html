EST</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the jersey?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a jersey, or another pinstriped suit?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hockey sweater.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there free trade or something?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another broken promise.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There we go.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we won\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another missed deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it here yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The jersey is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It has arrived?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- is in the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, then.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this, I will probably -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably see this tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I do regret that -- it has my name on it, the Canadians were very nice about -- and I -- Marvin is a big hockey fan, a big Canadian hockey fan, and I told him today that I greatly lament that I should have gotten Nicholson put on the back of this jersey and given it to him.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty cool with just getting the jersey that says Gibbs on the back.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- he\xe2\x80\x99s altogether happy about that.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably do -- I will likely make good on my wager tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of wagers, are we still betting on a March 18th deadline?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good segue there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Pelosi only would say that the date is interesting.\xc2\xa0 Hoyer is obviously not on board.\xc2\xa0 We got a week -- is this really going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think whether you traveled with the President over the last few days or whether you saw his remarks, his great interest is in getting this done as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this for -- the formal process of working on this for more than a year.</p>\n<p>The President, again, said last night it is time for Congress to act; it is time for Congress to vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President wants.\xc2\xa0 Quite frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Speaker Pelosi, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Majority Leader Reid want.\xc2\xa0 We are working toward that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re -- I know that CBO is evaluating different aspects of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 Our hope is to get this done as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 If it takes a couple extra days after a year, it takes a couple of extra days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re backing off the 18th date?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I am saying that the President wants, as do -- as does everybody here -- wants to get this done as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, on the immigration meeting today, is there the political oxygen to get this done?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you guys are fighting on cap and trade; your guys -- you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting on financial regulatory reform that Dodd came out on; health care is not a done deal.\xc2\xa0 Why add yet another priority that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of bipartisan support on it, when the White House\xe2\x80\x99s priority has been said to be jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this.\xc2\xa0 Our priority -- our main priority is jobs and on getting the economy focused on creating those jobs in both the short term and laying the foundation for long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The President had a very productive meeting, he believed, and I think many of the Democrats and Republicans left the meeting on comprehensive energy legislation -- left that meeting feeling positive.</p>\n<p>Today the President will meet with Senators Schumer and Senator Graham, a Democrat and a Republican, to see where they are in building that bipartisan coalition, because I think you hit the nail on the head by saying this is not something that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to pass without strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 So the President is anxious today to get an update from them on the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made on seeking and gaining that bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 That meeting, I think, is a little bit later on the afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have -- likely have a readout after that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say that -- is the White House aware that -- or you guys are working with Capitol Hill independently to build support for immigration reform?\xc2\xa0 It has been more than a year since the President made the promise to present legislation to Capitol Hill, and so far there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the two primary sponsors that are working on this legislation now -- Senator Schumer and Senator Graham -- the President is eager to hear from both of them today about the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made, aspects that they\xe2\x80\x99re working on in their legislation, but more than introducing a bill, more than outlining the specifics of this proposal or that proposal, as was mentioned a minute ago, the only way that -- the only way we get this through the House and the Senate is with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So the President is going to ask each of them today the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made on lining that bipartisan support up.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the American people want us to deal with their problems, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the update the President is anxious to get.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of bipartisanship -- how\xe2\x80\x99s that for another segue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the question is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the breakdown on financial regulatory reform talks?\xc2\xa0 Senator Dodd -- what does that mean for the chances of getting fin reg passed this year, both on a substance level and on a political level?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I -- look, I think obviously Senator Dodd has done a tremendous amount of amount of work on financial reform.\xc2\xa0 Legislation has passed the House.\xc2\xa0 First, talks broke down between -- with Senator Shelby leaving the process, and now Senator Corker has -- is going to continue to talk to Senator Dodd but Senator Dodd is going to put out a piece of legislation that can be marked up prior to the upcoming recess so that we can move this process forward.</p>\n<p>Jeff, our strong hope is that instituting rules for the road, ensuring that we don\xe2\x80\x99t face the type of crisis we did a few years ago, that we have protections for consumers that don\xe2\x80\x99t have carve-outs for things like payday lending -- those are all important to the President on a substance level and I think quite frankly important to the American people.</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99s going -- the President will continue to work, as Senator Dodd said he would, on getting the support necessary to get this through Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody wants to leave Congress this year, more than two years after -- at that point, it will be two years after the economic collapse -- without putting into effect new rules that would prevent the same type of reckless activity that got us in the mess to begin with.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people want to leave Congress without that having been done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to do that, you have to have votes, right?\xc2\xa0 And so what does the fact that this has broken down mean for that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it means that we\xe2\x80\x99re still likely, again, to get something that gets marked up and moves this process forward onto the floor, where I assume there will be a myriad of amendments on different aspects of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President has outlined the priorities that are strongest for him, as the Secretary of the Treasury has as well.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still very optimistic that this can get done.\xc2\xa0 I think this will get done this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I think it is going to be up to those that do not want to see rules in place to prevent what happened -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- if you\'re not supportive of those new rules you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a chance to explain that opposition to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think given what the American people have lived through as a result of that economic collapse, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe many are going to want to go home and face voters next November not having done something as it relates to those rules.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has talked quite a bit about wanting an up or down vote for health care reform legislation in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some talk now among House Democrats of using a certain kind of rule so that the Senate bill could be adopted without ever actually having a vote taken in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re calling this the Slaughter rule, after Louise Slaughter of the Rules Committee.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not familiar with this, so I would have to check with somebody about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the larger question is just, would it be okay with the President for this to happen, without there ever being actually a vote?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I have not looked at what the specifics of this are, so let me take a look.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 In the House earlier today, Dr. Peter Mugyenyi, who was on hand when President Bush introduced PEPFAR, said that over the last two years PEPFAR funding has flat-lined.\xc2\xa0 He said new PEPFAR contract awards emphasize treatment for \xe2\x80\x9conly those already on it and only very limited slots for new patients.\xc2\xa0 Currently my institution, which pioneered antiretroviral therapy in Africa and treats a large proportion of AIDS patients in Uganda, is not taking new patients due to lack of funding.\xc2\xa0 We\'re forced to turn away desperate patients daily, often 15 to 20.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>There is a slight increase in funding for PEPFAR in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, but it is less than the rate of inflation in Africa, which is why they say it\xe2\x80\x99s flat-lined.\xc2\xa0 The President, when he was running for President, at Saddleback said that he supported an increase of a billion dollars a year.\xc2\xa0 Why has he chosen to break this promise?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the specific comments that you reference.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has been a big supporter of this program and I think when asked in the past has been very complimentary of former President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in getting this type of program -- not just coming up with it conceptually but getting it through Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President obviously is committed to that.\xc2\xa0 As you mention, there\xe2\x80\x99s an increase in the budget.\xc2\xa0 I would have to take a look at the exact figures and get back to you on what the exact PEPFAR funding dollars are for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can tell you if you want.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a look at it and talk to the budget folks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A $180 million increase, and that\xe2\x80\x99s about 2 or 3 percent --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I don\'t have the budget in front of me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take a look at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I did the research before.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t go by my numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer to look at the budget.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the last few days the President has obviously launched on this road show to push health care reform and has been beating up on the insurance industry.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen any benefit at all from that so far?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Benefit --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of support?\xc2\xa0 Have you seen numbers just -- you know, hearing from people on the ground -- that people are starting to buy this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think people are starting to -- look, I think the insurance rate increases that people have seen over the course of the past four to six weeks, I think have crystallized this debate in a way that broke through and really localized what people were facing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we understood that as it looked like health care reform might not happen, we got a sense of what happens if we don\'t get meaningful health care reform.\xc2\xa0 We are going to see the type of rate increases that patients have gotten in the mail when their insurers take their insurance rates and increase them exponentially seven, eight, nine, 10 times that of health care inflation.\xc2\xa0 I think members are hearing from constituents who are getting those letters.\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen media coverage of those increases in a way that I think has, like I said, really crystallized for many people the problem, because you heard the mantra of let\xe2\x80\x99s not do this now, let\xe2\x80\x99s start over.\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here a lot, these insurance companies are not starting over, right?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not pushing pause on a health insurance increase of 40 percent or 39 percent when health care inflation is going up 4 or 5 percent.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not starting over -- they\xe2\x80\x99re exponentially increasing what individuals in that market are facing.</p>\n<p>So I think it has had a very positive effect for moving and providing some health -- momentum for health care reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the President still planning to launch his Asia trip on time?\xc2\xa0 Any chance of a delay?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- if we have any changes in the schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly let you know, but the President believes it is an extremely important trip with -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an important region of the world and these are important partners.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, obviously has seen, as many countries including ours have seen, the impacts of horrific terrorist activities.\xc2\xa0 Australia is a country we enjoy a trade surplus with, something the President is anxious to highlight, as well as a strong supporter of ours in providing support for Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s two important partners in two -- in a very important region of the world and the President looks forward to making the trip.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You seemed to back off on the March 18th deadline a bit there by saying it could -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s a day or two -- but does the President still want this thing passed by -- that Senate bill passed by the House before he gets on the plane?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, if it takes a couple of days extra, Chip, we\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to have it passed then, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even if he\xe2\x80\x99s already taken off on the trip.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Even if he\xe2\x80\x99s already gone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily going to delay this takeoff.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you right now on the trip, except to say the President is going on that trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Henry Waxman has said that the goal -- the plan of Democrats now is to get this thing passed, get the 216 votes without trying to change the abortion provision; simply include the Senate provision, and if Stupak and company vote against it, so be it, if they think they can get the votes without that.\xc2\xa0 Is that your understanding, and is that the strategy the way --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if Nancy-Ann or others have spoken with Congressman Waxman about that or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi today said -- getting back to the issue of the 18th and when this thing gets through -- she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning the House -- \xe2\x80\x9cwill spend at least a week on it among ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And a week from today is the 18th.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that she seems to be in less of a rush --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think she\xe2\x80\x99s in less of a rush.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody that\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in this for more than a year is plenty energized to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned -- has the President expressed concern or have Nancy-Ann and other people that if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get passed buy -- get signed into law by the 26th, then people go home for recess, that it will be another August all over again?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you saw the support for health care reform, if you looked at the polling in August, increase, so I don\'t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a fear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be worried about people going home --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 Indonesia has been portrayed by some, in some articles, as more of a vacation trip than a policy and diplomacy trip.\xc2\xa0 How much of it is vacation, taking the family along?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a vacation at all.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I have not seen the criticism that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not criticism.\xc2\xa0 Nobody is criticizing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re simply saying that part of what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing is taking the family to show where he grew up for four years of his life.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of an educational trip for the family.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is the -- as I mentioned earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s the largest Muslim country in the world.\xc2\xa0 The President will build off the speech he gave in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 The President will attend a democracy conference in Indonesia; will highlight counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of the trip.\xc2\xa0 This is not a -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of the trip, not anything else.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a family education trip, too?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, not at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything about the trip that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be delayed if you needed to?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything about -- is there something on the trip that you have to do in that week, or could you put it off a couple of weeks to finish up health care?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The trip won\xe2\x80\x99t be put off a couple weeks.\xc2\xa0 The President will be traveling to Indonesia and be traveling to Australia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a concern about leaving here if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been completed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate all the hypotheticals, but I\xe2\x80\x99m -- we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get health care done, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go on an important trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to leave before the Easter recess if they\xe2\x80\x99re not done.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to go on the trip, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the financial reform, is there a concern that the same thing that happened -- that you could lose the trust of Corker -- Corker is the one Republican you guys are negotiating with right now -- is there a concern that if you have this dual track of a bill, that you could lose the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean a dual track?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if Dodd does his own bill himself sort of without --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Chuck --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- without Corker completely, are you concerned that you lose Corker?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, if Senator Corker -- if Senator Corker can\xe2\x80\x99t agree to some adjustments in his positions in order to sign on to a bipartisan bill, this is a better question for Senator Corker in terms of what he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to meet people part of the way on.</p>\n<p>Again, you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were you concerned with a delay tactic, is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I -- look, I think many of us read yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s newspaper about carving out payday lending from consumer financial protections, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think many people in the White House or at the Treasury Department thought that was a great idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any other Republicans that you think will come on board on financial reform?\xc2\xa0 Because you need at least one, assuming --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the better question is, to Republicans, why would you filibuster financial regulatory reform?\xc2\xa0 Why would you -- why would you, when lobbyists are being hired hand over fist to kill financial reform, why do you seem to side with high-priced lobbyists instead of putting strong rules in place to prevent what happened before?\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that\xe2\x80\x99s a fight they really want to have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no bipartisan support of a bill that comes out of that committee -- is that okay with the White House?\xc2\xa0 Obviously you want bipartisan support, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll accept --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think Senator Dodd has, first, spent an awful lot of time with the ranking member, Senator Shelby, and then at some point Senator Shelby decided he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be part of that process anymore.\xc2\xa0 He spent a lot of time with Senator Corker, and now Senator Corker has decided he can\xe2\x80\x99t be part of that process.</p>\n<p>Again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s negotiating in good faith anymore?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 Senator Dodd and Senator Corker are going to continue to talk about these problems.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this is a better question for Senator Corker about what is it that -- what is it that he has to see to come on board.</p>\n<p>Again, I think Republicans in the Senate are going to have to ask themselves why they would stand in the way of financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that the House find a way not to pass -- to make sure the Senate bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become passed if they don\xe2\x80\x99t do the reconciliation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I have not read what Jake was talking about, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported for two weeks.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not seen it and don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On financial regulation, how would you respond to Senate Republicans who say that the use of reconciliation on health care has poisoned the atmosphere out there and that\xe2\x80\x99s hurting bipartisan cooperation on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same old tired spin they were using last week and the week before.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m always struck by comments like when Senator Gregg says 51 votes is 51 votes, unless he\xe2\x80\x99s on the other side, apparently, of 51 votes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful -- helpfully contrived answers to justify delay tactics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on immigration, you said that the President wants to hear what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing to build a bipartisan coalition.\xc2\xa0 What has the President been doing to build a bipartisan coalition?\xc2\xa0 To what extent does he view this as his responsibility to bring some other Republicans on board?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, he\xe2\x80\x99s been -- the President worked in the Senate in both 2005 and 2006 with a bipartisan coalition to see comprehension immigration reform happen.\xc2\xa0 The President is strongly supportive of comprehensive reform.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s anxious to talk to Senator Schumer and Senator Graham as to -- some of the colleagues that he worked with that they\xe2\x80\x99re in contact with each and every day, where are they on -- where are they now on reform?\xc2\xa0 Where are Republicans that were for reform in 2005, in 2006, in 2007, in 2008 -- where are they now in 2010?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just how actively is he personally working it or is he leaving it to his allies on the Hill at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get an update and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly had meetings, several meetings, here.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with activists on these issues and he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk with the CHC later today about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing, just on the scheduling of the trip, just ask you one other way I guess -- I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to put it off by a couple weeks, but are you aware of any contingency planning to move it back even a day or two if necessary?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements on today\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if the House were to pass the Senate health care bill, would the President sign it right away or wait for a fix-it bill to be enacted?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this gets into parliamentary issues that may well be decided by the parliamentarian on Capitol Hill, not by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If a bill arrives here, though, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he sign it or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did the President react in any way to what Chief Justice Roberts said yesterday about using his State of the Union speech to take a swipe at the Supreme Court decision?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President, in many ways, responded to the Supreme Court decision at that State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 Look, we -- we\'re heading into an election season, and to open up and change the -- the President fundamentally disagrees with that decision, as, I would say, do the vast majority of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think the President thought it was anything but perfectly acceptable -- I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re there, but he and the American people disagree with the decision that they made.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re actively working with Congress to close any of the loopholes that have been open to ensure that the special interests don\'t have a greater hold on our electoral system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if Chief Justice Roberts and the President spoke to one another since that night?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What Roberts complained about was the fact the State of the Union has become a political pep rally and he said -- \xe2\x80\x9cwonders why we\'re there.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t respond to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the Chief Justice --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Mr. -- if I\'m not mistaken, many of you showed footage of Justice Alito responding to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to the question that Mark asked, though.\xc2\xa0 He said -- he asked about Chief Justice Roberts.\xc2\xa0 Does the President disagree with Chief Justice Roberts?\xc2\xa0 Does he think it has not taken on a pep rally political air in the State of the Union address?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President believes that the State of the Union is an important venue to lay out his agenda for the year and to update the American people on the work that the Congress and the President do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason for the justices to sit there and feel uncomfortable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know why they\xe2\x80\x99d feel uncomfortable.\xc2\xa0 They made the decision.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I guess I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the criticism of feeling uncomfortable if they\xe2\x80\x99re -- look, the President disagreed and polls show 80 percent of the country disagrees with that decision.\xc2\xa0 The President would have said that in that room had they been sitting in that row or not been there at all.\xc2\xa0 The President is -- the President just disagrees, quite frankly, with the decision that they made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he also disagrees -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the State of the Union has become just a political rally?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s only done one of them.\xc2\xa0 We did obviously address the first year -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a pep rally to me.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I just follow up on something Mark asked about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just try to get through a few more.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You may have just made news and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you\xe2\x80\x99re aware.\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of members of the House are very worried that what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen with health care is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to sign the Senate bill and the Senate is never going to pass the fix.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying the President would sign the -- would sign it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I think Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question was if the bill was here --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re assuming the bill won\xe2\x80\x99t get here.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, what I said earlier was that I think likely the parliamentarian will make some rulings about how bills go and where they go, and we will wait, certainly, for those rulings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned that during the Senate confirmation hearing Eric Holder didn\xe2\x80\x99t disclose that he signed a brief asking the Supreme Court not to uphold President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he could imprison American citizens as enemy combatants?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the Justice Department has said that they take responsibility for that not having been included, and I think they addressed that in a statement yesterday and I would point you over to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t he include it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question for the Attorney General and the Justice Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a chance of reviving a standalone consumer protection agency now that Dodd is introducing his own legislation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens I think Monday when Senator Dodd rolls out a piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important is not simply where and the address of an agency that would protect consumers but what\xe2\x80\x99s the scope, what\xe2\x80\x99s the independence, what\xe2\x80\x99s their ability to set their own budget and make rules.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate.\xc2\xa0 And if the President believes that the legislation that leaves the committee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t meet those standards, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll seek to strengthen the bill on the floor of the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you be happy if it were at the Fed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of where the bill might place it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, what side deals additionally would the White House like to see removed from the Senate bill in addition to the ones already outlined by the President on the Web site?\xc2\xa0 There are ones in Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 Can you list any others?\xc2\xa0 Would those be the three that we would be most directed towards?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that the legislation that the President put on the Internet removed many of the special provisions that initially were in the legislation.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made it clear to the Senate that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position in the final legislation should not contain provisions that favor a single state or a single district differently than others.\xc2\xa0 Across the board we\'ve -- I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you list any others that I did not mention?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which ones did you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Vermont.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that -- Massachusetts --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I said New Hampshire --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Massachusetts and Vermont I\'m told are not in there.\xc2\xa0 The Medicare Advantage stuff for New York and Florida is not in there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a provision I think that benefited Michigan that is not in there, and I think as the story said today, and as I\'ve said earlier, there are additional things like maybe Montana and Connecticut that we\'ve asked the Senate to take out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how has that been communicated?\xc2\xa0 Because when asked about that on the Hill today, some Senate leadership aides and senators involved were unaware of it.\xc2\xa0 Was this communicated by the chief of staff in any of the two meetings that have gone on on the Hill this week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they talked about it specifically in those two meetings, but I\'ll see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 There was a Post story this morning -- I\'ve got the survey here in front of me -- about employers and what they expect to have -- what they expect to happen as they deal with health care -- these are employers who provide health insurance -- with health reform:\xc2\xa0 69 percent say in a survey that they expect their costs to go up, and a third or more of them expect a decrease in the amount of employer-provided health care as a result of reform, not with things at the status quo.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m curious if those who are providing health care now, looking at reform legislation, as they understand it, fear their costs will go up, and in some cases, the insurance they\xe2\x80\x99re able to provide will decrease -- what should American people conclude from their fears about what health reform will mean for them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Major, I think we -- you\xe2\x80\x99d certainly have to evaluate the individual businesses and the circumstances that are involved.\xc2\xa0 I would say that as we set up an exchange that provides choice and competition, one of the provisions that the President added also was a rate authority to look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to insurance as we\'ve seen in the individual market and in other places, to assure that as insurance companies are looking at their customer base right now they\xe2\x80\x99re not increasing the cost of their insurance at a way that isn\xe2\x80\x99t justifiable.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the Secretary of Health and Human Services has asked those major insurers to provide actuarial data to demonstrate exactly what would justify those price increases.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there something they\xe2\x80\x99re misunderstanding about reform, though?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are pretty solid numbers -- 69 percent fear that their own costs will go up as a result of what health reform will mean for them; their administrative costs, they say, they fear will go up because of health care reform.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there are strong provisions in health care reform that would require a lot less paperwork, a lot more of premium dollars going to cover health care and not to -- through a series of selection maneuvers -- try to figure out who not to cover and who to cover and whose rates to jack up and how to try to game the system a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I think there are strong provisions in the legislation that would prevent that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They just misunderstand this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to them, Major.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what -- I don\'t know, again, what they\xe2\x80\x99re basing some of that on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other issues.\xc2\xa0 This is related to Justice Roberts and the Supreme Court decision.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that appears to have happened as a result of that is the Chamber of Commerce is now growing in its lobbying efforts and raising money and exercising a more aggressive political voice in the entire process.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned about the Chamber, and does it see any result of its increased ability to raise funds, increased ability to get involved in grassroots political activity as an outgrowth of the Citizens United case?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- our disagreement with the decision isn\xe2\x80\x99t directed at one entity\xe2\x80\x99s use of loopholes; it is directed at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s use of enhanced loopholes.\xc2\xa0 This is -- whether this is an organization that normally aligns itself with Republicans or with Democrats.\xc2\xa0 The President fundamentally disagrees with a decision that provides more power in our elections to big money and special interests regardless of what side of the political spectrum they\xe2\x80\x99re on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Considering the clash, or the apparent clash, between the White House and the Chamber last year, does this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I dismissed the Chamber argument a minute ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing, because last Tuesday you told us, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t have the update with me on Sestak.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Two things have happened since then.\xc2\xa0 Two things have happened.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Darrell Issa sent a letter to the White House Counsel --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything additional on that.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you ever going to have anything additional on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have it today.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about the timing of the immigration and energy meetings this week.\xc2\xa0 Health care is in a kind of endgame here.\xc2\xa0 Financial regulatory reform is about to take another step.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re having meetings this week, updates, as you describe them, on two major pieces of legislation.\xc2\xa0 Why this week?\xc2\xa0 Are you trying -- are you triaging in a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the rest of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I think two things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already discussed are big priorities for the President after we get health care reform done.\xc2\xa0 First is financial reform, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, and that\xe2\x80\x99s moving its way through the process.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the Citizens United case.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got important elections coming up, and the question is, are the special interests going to have -- play a bigger role in those with their contributions than they normally would?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously there are a series of -- a series of legislative activities around tax credits for small business and hiring, small business lending, and different job creation programs that the President is focused on.</p>\n<p>Immigration is something that the President has supported for quite some time, and energy has made it through the House, and my guess is there will be a clamoring for an energy bill when gas prices go up, as they normally do, as we get closer to more driving as we get closer to the summer.</p>\n<p>So I think the President is trying to get an update on each of these issues to see what the pathway forward is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that immigration and energy, while important to the President, clearly aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the top of his priority list for this year.\xc2\xa0 Does he want to see something done on energy or immigration this year?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, Sam, but again, what I said I think to the very first question, it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be more than the President wants to get something done.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to ask, as he did in the energy meeting and as he will when he meets with Schumer and Graham, to see what progress they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in aligning their colleagues for the type of reform that all three support.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be key to moving any of these issues forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a follow on the follow-up.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham said to me a couple of days ago that he felt that the onus was really on the President and that he sort of wanted an update from the President and \xe2\x80\x9cthe President needed to step it up.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How could the President step it up, and do you think -- and Graham also said that it was hard to line up that elusive second Republican without the President weighing in on, say, the biometric ID card.\xc2\xa0 Does he have any intention of stepping forward on this stuff?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President is going to get an update specifically on the provisions that they mention on ID cards.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- my guess is we\xe2\x80\x99re more than one more Republican away from immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I appreciate that the President is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure the President will be effective in talking to many of our friends on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not lumping this all onto Senator Graham.\xc2\xa0 We can all name many Republicans that have been for immigration reform at different parts in their career.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you name them?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can.\xc2\xa0 But the question is, where are they?\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Graham is certainly pretty well positioned to get -- to take their temperature and see what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take for them to make progress on this issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you open to the idea -- is the President open to the idea of the ID card?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get an update on that today and I think he will be interested in hearing from both of them on the nature of their proposal and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal, again, that can garner increased bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>Do you have anything?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, this has been going for many, many years, and this was really a Republican bill which President Bush pushed hard personally.\xc2\xa0 And also, don\'t you think the President believes that immigration is related directly with health care and also economy because it will bring billions of dollars as far as these people living, almost 20 million plus, under a shadow, and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know how directly it\xe2\x80\x99s linked to all those issues.\xc2\xa0 I know -- as you mentioned, former President Bush was a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, and we made progress on that issue.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the President is anxious to hear from others and from Graham and Schumer as to where they are.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Congressional Black Caucus meeting today, what specifically on health care is the President going to discuss with those members at that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to discuss and outline the proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward, the reason that he believes that the time is now to get it done, and ask not simply for their support on that but also for them to talk to their fellow members and build support in the House to get this done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there concerns about the lack of a public option?\xc2\xa0 What does the President -- is the President going to be open to hearing them at that meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are at a point in the process where the President has outlined a proposal.\xc2\xa0 Different aspects of that proposal are being scored by CBO and looked at and evaluated by others.\xc2\xa0 The legislation does not include a public option.\xc2\xa0 It does include strong provisions for choice and competition.</p>\n<p>I think you heard the President pretty clearly the other -- last night.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to -- it\xe2\x80\x99s time to put the debate and the discussion to rest.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to vote.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask them to come to the table and support moving forward on this in a vote.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on -- a follow-up on the CBC, please.\xc2\xa0 According to reports and from hearing in the past, is there tension between the Congressional Black Caucus and this President, and does the CBC have the ear of this President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the same stories you have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These stories have been circulating for a while.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think the President -- look, the President used to be a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I think the President has first and foremost used every bit of his power and done everything that he possibly could to help change the economic circumstances of this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, wait a minute, let me finish, please.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 Lester, Lester, Lester, hold on, let me -- come on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was on a roll, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please let me finish.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying.\xc2\xa0 No, the President has done everything in his power to do what he can to get our economy moving again, to put people back to work, to take the steps necessary to try to replace the jobs -- some of the jobs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, and build, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about before, a foundation for jobs in the future.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about education.\xc2\xa0 I think we -- I think the President has worked on -- worked on, throughout his time here, issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, and to many in the Democratic Party since being elected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 One that note, on that note, though, many in the civil rights community are concerned that this President -- there\xe2\x80\x99s word after that meeting that the President had with the civil rights leaders during the snowstorm that he was emphatic, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not have an urban agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Did this President say he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have an urban agenda?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was shoveling my driveway during that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to -- I, April, doubt seriously that the President said that, because I think putting people back to work, keeping their health care costs low, improving our schools, I think in every way, shape or form, that\xe2\x80\x99s an agenda that helps urban America, it helps rural America.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been very proactive on an agenda that helps members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on that subject --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said I would take your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on that subject -- I think I was next.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, Lester.\xc2\xa0 You weren\xe2\x80\x99t, but anyway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, after the meeting today, would the President say or give some kind of statement that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hopeful for the immigrants that are waiting for him to do something?\xc2\xa0 They are saying that the President promised, and they really voted for him because they believed in him.\xc2\xa0 Now it has been a long time, and they have gotten nothing.\xc2\xa0 And what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that it has gotten worse because the families are being torn apart, more now than before.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a readout after the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to include something from the President in that.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President believes that the system that we have right now is unworkable and unsustainable; that we have to have a comprehensive solution to a problem that we\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with for many years.\xc2\xa0 His commitment to that is unchanged, and if we can see a path to getting this done in the Congress with bipartisan support I can assure you the President is anxious to get this and many other things done.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll do one more, Lester, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 A two-part.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Why is the President --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How come -- it used to be two questions.\xc2\xa0 Is this one question with two parts?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Why is the President meeting today in the White House with the racially segregated Congressional Black Caucus, which rejected the membership applications of Democrat Congressmen Pete Stark of California and Steve Cohen of Tennessee because of their white skin?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- the President was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus and looks forward to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he approve of racial segregation like this?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does he or not?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is not in charge of the membership of the Congressional Black Caucus, Lester.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he disagree with it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is anxious to meet with their members and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a very charming evasion.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the compliment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so charming.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think -- I think given that charm, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to skip on out on your second part.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:35 P.M. EST</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
