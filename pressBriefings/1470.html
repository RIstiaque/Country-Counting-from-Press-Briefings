EDT</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Good morning.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us on our trip to Massachusetts and Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 I have a week ahead for you all.</p>\n<p>The President will spend this weekend in Washington, he has no scheduled public events.\xc2\xa0 On Monday afternoon the President will travel to Jacksonville, Florida, to meet with U.S. servicemen and women and to deliver remarks at Naval Air Station Jacksonville.\xc2\xa0 Later he will travel to Miami, where he will deliver remarks at a DSCC/DCCC fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend the night in Miami.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday the President goes to Southwest Florida.\xc2\xa0 He will then travel to Norfolk, Virginia, where he will deliver remarks at a rally for Creigh Deeds at Old Dominion University.\xc2\xa0 He will return to the White House that night.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday the President will deliver remarks at the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday the President will meet with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And on Friday the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>With that, let\'s open it up.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we read anything into the fact that he\'s talking to military members on Monday?\xc2\xa0 Is an Afghanistan decision in the offing?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, he will -- he will make his decision on Afghanistan at the right time.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t over-read anything into the remarks that he\'s delivering on Monday, other than he wants to thank the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces for the hard and courageous work that they do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Home sales jumped to 9.4 percent.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration\'s view, and if you could talk about the extending of the first-time homebuyers tax credit?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that, you know, there are some indicators that show that the economy is, in places, doing better.\xc2\xa0 But the President still thinks there is a lot more work to do.\xc2\xa0 He\'s going to continue to work to make sure that we are putting Americans back to work and getting this economy back on track.\xc2\xa0 But other than that I don\'t have anything specific for you on the extension of the homebuyers\' tax credit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the opt-in versus opt-out public option?\xc2\xa0 It seems like there\'s apparently a vote being taken as you and I speak this moment in a caucus in the House on all of this.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- does the President believe that some sort of public option will be in both bills when they pass the floors?\xc2\xa0 And does he favor some particular approach to the public option that he thinks is the most likely to pass?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This may surprise you, but the President didn\'t send his number two spokesperson to the back of the plane to roll out a new position on the public option today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that the public option is the best way to achieve choice and competition and bring down health care costs for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to ensure that it is achieved in the final health care reform legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on the latest from Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Iran.\xc2\xa0 The President, just like everyone else, is waiting to hear from ElBaradei on what the final word is.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have more for you when we hear.</p>\n<p>Boy, the moment when you lift off you really feel it, don\'t you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President\'s message was to the congressional leaders that came to the White House last night?\xc2\xa0 There wasn\'t much by way of a readout last night.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President and leadership from the Senate had a very productive conversation about the way forward as it relates to health care reform, and they\'re going to continue to work day and night to make sure that it gets done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he communicate what he and Pelosi talked about during their lunch?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know at that level of granularity whether or not he talked about another conversation in that conversation that was in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 But they all talked about health care reform and how we achieve it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was productive but not robust?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, it was productive and robust.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s going on with the vote counts?\xc2\xa0 Valerie took a shot at Mike Allen this morning on MS saying that he probably -- she doesn\'t know if he can count votes.\xc2\xa0 The White House obviously can count votes.\xc2\xa0 Are there the votes there in the House for the public option?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Far be it from me to question Valerie\'s assessment of Mike Allen\'s vote counting.\xc2\xa0 However, I will say that the President continues to think that the public option is the best way to achieve choice and competition, and that\'s what he\'s working towards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are the votes there?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\'re working on getting health care reform done, and in order to do that, obviously you\'re going to need some votes in the United States Senate to move it forward, and that\'s what we\'re working on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any thoughts on this plane that apparently had the pilots fall asleep over Minneapolis?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate on any of that.\xc2\xa0 I will just point you towards the FAA and the TSA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re sure you don\'t have any thoughts?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m pretty sure I don\'t have any thoughts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, what\'s the main energy message today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to talk about the importance of investing in innovative energy technology, how it can create jobs and help this economy grow in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sounds like the same message that\'s been out there for a while.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\'s an important message, and the President is going to continue to talk about things that can help grow the economy, because there are few things in this administration that are more important than creating jobs and getting this economy on track.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the energy thing specifically, will he use this as an opportunity to specifically talk about the need to push forward on energy legislation, climate change legislation, pending in the House and Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This event is more about jobs and the economy, and specifically some of the investments that we\'ve made than it is about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On exec comp, three employees will make -- will have salaries more than $1 million; a total of 66 will have their total compensation above $1 million.\xc2\xa0 How does that mesh with the administration\'s overall compensation plan?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President put Ken Feinberg in place so that he could make an independent assessment of the best way to make sure that the American taxpayers were protected and that their tax dollars were used wisely and prudently, considering the economic situation that we\'re in.</p>\n<p>There\'s been a lot of criticism from folks who think that the administration has been too hard on executives.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been criticism from folks who think that it\'s been far too lenient.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that the independent assessment that Ken Feinberg undertook was appropriate and is glad that he\'s been the fierce advocate for American taxpayers that he put him in place to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President thinks it\'s appropriate that 66 of these executives from bailed-out firms are going to have compensation packages over $1 million?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get into the specifics of every decision that he made.\xc2\xa0 Ken Feinberg took a comprehensive look at all the different firms and the compensation packages and made an assessment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to make a statement on Iran later today, Bill?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\'re waiting like everybody else.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what exactly are you waiting for?\xc2\xa0 State television in Iran pretty much said this was a non-starter.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The word is that ElBaradei has not received official word yet, so we\'re waiting until that happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, one more question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President wearing a pink tie for Breast Cancer Awareness Month?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you too?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a coordinating strategy.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It is a comprehensive effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t get the memo.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Clearly.\xc2\xa0 I see a lot of green and blue here in the press corps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wore mine yesterday.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Different people make different choices.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s Plouffe doing on board?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He\'s here as a guest of the President.\xc2\xa0 He\'s about to go on a book tour, and this is one of the last opportunities he\'ll have to spend time with the President before he does that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been on Air Force One before?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President read the book?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I don\'t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you check and find out?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Maybe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Bill.</p>\n<p>* * * * *</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I just read the remarks more closely.\xc2\xa0 The President will, indeed, address comprehensive legislation that helps to make renewable energy a profitable kind of energy in America.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about it how can create millions of jobs, combat global warming by -- and decrease our dependence on foreign (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 He\'ll thank Congressman Markey for the work he did on getting legislation through in the House, and Senator John Kerry for some of the work that he\'s doing in the Senate to get it done.</p>\n<p>I also didn\'t mention earlier that Senator Kerry is on the plane -- which you may or may not have known.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so after initially refusing to talk about the energy legislation, he\'s (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 I\'m kidding.\xc2\xa0 Kidding.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This means that the speech is largely a push for the climate change legislation --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I wouldn\'t say that.\xc2\xa0 It talks about the importance of investments in order to create jobs in this field of, you know, innovation and finding ways to make clean, renewable energy.\xc2\xa0 But definitely gets into comprehensive energy legislation (inaudible).</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exhorting the Senate.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Say that again?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exhorting the Senate.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He talks about its importance and he\'s urging all of us to work hard to get it done.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>10:46 A.M.
