Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:53 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please see below for a correction of a typo (marked with asterisks) to the transcript.</em></p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make -- welcome to the White House for your daily briefing -- so I will go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 Ken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be meeting with King Abdullah today.\xc2\xa0 What is he hoping to accomplish with this meeting?\xc2\xa0 And at this point, what are the expectations for Middle East peace?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is meeting with the King of Jordan, as you note.\xc2\xa0 They will discuss a variety of issues, as they always do -- regional issues as well as King Abdullah\'s important leadership role in the region, notably through his pursuit of our shared goal of a two-state solution through the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 They will also discuss Syria and the King\'s courageous statements calling on President Assad to step down in that neighboring state.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for our view of the peace process, we commend the Jordanian King for the role he\'s played in the talks and the renewal of talks.\xc2\xa0 We believe that those talks offer the parties a real opportunity to make meaningful progress towards peace.\xc2\xa0 This is a difficult issue; it has long been a difficult issue.\xc2\xa0 And it has its best chance of reaching a positive result when the two sides are sitting down negotiating face to face.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way to bring about peace.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way to resolve the issues that divide the Israelis and the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we support this progress, but we obviously recognize that there\'s a long road to travel here to get to a final result.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said this morning the Palestinians had no interest in entering peace talks. Does that perhaps put some cold water on these discussions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we don\'t characterize other leaders\' remarks.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on a process here and the reality that the way to achieve peace is through face-to-face, direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there has been some progress in that regard is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 We\'re certainly not going to overstate it.\xc2\xa0 There are many thorny issues to resolve, but this is the mode and the forum by which you can get this done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some members of the Jobs Council would like the U.S. to stop taxing overseas profits.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration support that proposal?\xc2\xa0 And what\'s the administration\'s take on the proposal to open up federal land to more exploration of oil, gas and coal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any announcements to make on the specific policy that you mentioned.\xc2\xa0 I would note that of the 35 recommendations from the Jobs Council that don\'t require legislative action, the administration has taken action on 33 of them and completed implementation on 16.\xc2\xa0 That includes, most recently, from last week, the establishment of SelectUSA -- or rather that was in June -- but the insourcing forum that the President had highlighting this very important trend in American business where American companies are bringing jobs back to the United States, which is a very positive thing indeed, and the efforts the President wants to take to increase that trend.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, on oil and gas production, we have higher oil production in this country in -- had it in 2010 than we\'ve had since 2003.\xc2\xa0 This President is committed to an all-of-the-above approach in our energy development, which means increasing production here at home, a focus on natural gas and its importance for our energy future, as well as investments in clean energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have some stats here on the fact that last month, the Department of the Interior held a major oil and gas lease sale covering more than 21 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico that are currently not leased.\xc2\xa0 Also last month, as part of the President\'s effort, the Department of the Interior held a lease sale that covered over 140,000 acres in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.\xc2\xa0 And the point of this is that we\'re absolutely committed to increasing domestic oil and gas production, but to do it in a safe and responsible way.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\'s possible, and the facts that I just laid out to you demonstrate that.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around -- Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is Newt Gingrich correct in calling our President "the food stamp President"?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is this country is emerging from the worst recession since the Great Depression, the greatest economic and financial crisis of our lifetimes.\xc2\xa0 When this President took the oath of office in January of 2009, our economy was in freefall.\xc2\xa0 We were hemorrhaging jobs at the rate of nearly 800,000 a month.\xc2\xa0 The economy was contracting -- or had contracted in the previous quarter, the last quarter of President Bush\'s term in office, by nearly 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 The result of that terrible recession was a dramatic increase in unemployment and a dramatic increase -- or an increase, rather, in the number of people who need assistance -- needed assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would simply say that those are the facts, and the economic policies that helped create that situation are ones that, in the case of the candidate you just mentioned, he supported and they\'re the kinds of policies that he advocates to this day.\xc2\xa0 This President takes a different approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the language that the speaker uses is that these are people that President Obama put on the food stamps.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know as well as I do that that\'s crazy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the economy and some of the polls talking about -- the President has been in office more than two years, and some are saying that after two years, the President should take responsibility for some part of the economy.\xc2\xa0 Where does the Bush presidency end in this presidency when it comes to the economy, and where does this President pick up in taking responsibility for the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President took responsibility on the day he was sworn into office, and began a process of creating policies and implementing them that have helped us return to economic growth, have helped us have an economy that has created more than 3.1 million private sector jobs in the last 22 months, I believe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is the hole that was dug by this recession was very deep, and we are still climbing our way out of it.\xc2\xa0 There is still much more that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is focused on passing the American Jobs Act, for example, the need to work with Congress to do more to help the economy create jobs and grow faster.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he is so insistent that Congress act to extend the payroll tax cut through the end of the calendar year and extend unemployment insurance through the end of the calendar year.\xc2\xa0 And the President expects that Congress will do that without drama, and there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been some indication that members of Congress agree with that approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- but also there\xe2\x80\x99s the issue -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the hole was deep.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that we could go back into that hole with another component of the economy, the possibility of gas prices going up to $5 a gallon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this President remains concerned about oil prices and the effect an increase in gas prices can have on Americans across the country who are struggling to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the case since the day he took office.\xc2\xa0 It has been an issue that we are always focused on, as we were when there were price surges last year during the Arab Spring, and we continue to monitor that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has the all-of-the-above, all-inclusive approach to energy development and production that I described earlier at this briefing.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to have domestic oil and gas production increase as it has and to have our reliance on imports decrease as it has.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is long-term work, April, as you know.\xc2\xa0 We need to take a multifaceted approach to developing oil and gas resources here at home, to developing clean energy sources as well as taking other measures to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and broadly -- not just regarding the price of oil -- but helping the middle class through the measures this President has put forward to get on sounder economic footing.\xc2\xa0 That is the number-one objective -- domestic objective that this President has.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan, did you have one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Jobs Council and their recommendations, those that will require congressional approval.\xc2\xa0 What are the chances that there will be any real progress there, when the President himself pointed out this morning that in an election year, it will be difficult to get some of these things done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is certainly often the case that election years can create a difficult environment for legislative action.\xc2\xa0 However, there are notable exceptions to that.\xc2\xa0 Those of us who were here in 1996 remember a great deal of cooperation between a Republican Congress and a Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 We certainly hope that that will be the case this year.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to be done, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that can only be done through legislative action, through the kind of bipartisan cooperation that this President has stood for since he took office.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a great deal of opportunity out there for that kind of cooperation if leaders in Congress want to go in that direction, and if Republicans in particular want to go in that direction.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has put forward an agenda of economic and job-creating initiatives that are the kinds of initiatives that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support, that have traditionally garnered the kind of Republican support in the past that has ensured that these kinds of measures become law -- spending on our infrastructure, for example, the kinds of investments that help our economy in the long term but also put people back to work right away, idle construction workers who could be working right now if that element of the jobs act were passed by Congress and signed into law by this President.\xc2\xa0 Certainly the President would endorse that and hope that -- he hopes that happens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s true of a variety of measures that could be acted on if we can get the kind of bipartisan support that can be tough to find in an election year, but there is certainly precedent for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President views the economy overall, what does he rate it at right now?\xc2\xa0 Where does he see it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t discussed it in those terms with him, but I know that he believes we are on a better path.\xc2\xa0 The economy has been growing now for two years, roughly -- I forget the number of quarters -- but after shrinking considerably during the recession.\xc2\xa0 The economy has been creating jobs -- 3.2 million private sector jobs thus far.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s all -- those are all good signs of positive progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut none of it is enough.\xc2\xa0 This President is keenly aware of the fact that there are too many Americans out there who are still worried about losing their job or still looking for jobs and can\'t find them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\'s focused on doing everything he can, working with Congress and using his executive authority, to address that need for economic security and the need to grow the economy further and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question -- back on Newt Gingrich, also out on the trail today.\xc2\xa0 Someone in the audience was asking him about getting tougher on the President and when he was going to bloody his nose, and he said, "I don\'t want to bloody his nose, I want to knock him out."\xc2\xa0 What do you, and what does the President, perhaps, think --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard those comments.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the campaign trail is filled with exuberant rhetoric and I\'ll just let that one pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry if you\'ve answered this in the past.\xc2\xa0 The National Defense Authorization Act -- the President expressed concern about the provision that would allow the military to indefinitely detain an American citizen.\xc2\xa0 Last night at the debate -- at the Republican debate, not only did Ron Paul express a concern about that provision but Rick Santorum, not known for being libertarian or liberal on these issues, said that he thought the way the law was before was more appropriate than this new law.\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama doing anything to rescind this provision that gives the military this new power?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I have talked about it in the past.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, we had concerns with the legislation as it was written.\xc2\xa0 We worked with the authors of the legislation and changes were made that allowed the President to sign the bill.\xc2\xa0 And we have made clear in the signing of the legislation and in our discussions afterwards that the President retains the flexibility that he believes is essential for the Commander-in-Chief to make sure that our people in the field have all the tools necessary to do their job and that make sure that we are handling these matters in a way that are consistent with our values.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will implement the law in a way that makes that achievable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a signing statement that says this is how you\'re interpreting the law.\xc2\xa0 But the law is the military now has the power to indefinitely detain an American citizen if they suspect them of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that the President is going to interpret it his way, but he\'s not going to be the President forever.\xc2\xa0 He might not even be the President for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no updates for you on -- since the law was just passed and signed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no update to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that we made clear our concerns about it.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear how we will approach implementation of it.\xc2\xa0 And how this is revisited, if it is revisited, remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But at this moment, I think the President has been very clear about the values he brings to it and the method -- or rather the approach he will take when the law is implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you disagree with the way that the civil liberties groups and Rick Santorum are interpreting the law?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just refer you to the President\'s statement -- signing statement about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s not a declaration of -- I\'m not talking about how he\'s going to implement it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just talking about the law as it stands on the books.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand that, and we\'ve made clear what our position is on how it needs to be implemented in a way that\'s consistent with our values, in a way that -- and in a way that maintains maximum flexibility for our operators in the field.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just ask this final question.\xc2\xa0 Are you comfortable with how any President in the future might interpret that law?\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\'re -- that\'s a hypothetical about the future, and in terms of how we will approach this issue in the future I don\'t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 I can just point you to the way we have discussed it and the signing statement, as you mentioned, that the President used when he signed it into law.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the centerpiece of the President\'s economic or tax policy has been that everybody pays their fair share.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney, this morning, was asked about his tax rate.\xc2\xa0 He said that he pays closer to the 15 percent rate.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t discussed that with the President.\xc2\xa0 I think you know, from what the President has said and others in the administration, that he believes very strongly that -- or he agrees, rather, with Warren Buffett that those who are making millions of dollars -- millionaires and billionaires, say -- should not pay a lower effective tax rate than middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 As Warren Buffett put it, he should not pay a much lower tax rate than his own administrative assistant, his own secretary.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President shares that belief.\xc2\xa0 And I think that this only illuminates what he believes is an issue, which is that everybody who\'s working hard ought to pay their fair share, and that includes millionaires who might be paying an effective tax rate of 15 percent when folks making $50,000 or $75,000 or $100,000 a year are paying much more.\xc2\xa0 He thinks we ought to fix that.\xc2\xa0 And that is an element of the approach he takes in his economic proposals, as you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Mitt Romney is just following the law, isn\'t he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not disagreeing with that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we ought to change the law for that reason.\xc2\xa0 His policies about the need for everybody to get a fair shot and to pay their fair share have been quite clear.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had a lot of debates about it already with Congress, and I assume we\'ll have a debate about it this year once the Republicans choose their nominee.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly that everybody needs to pay their fair share and that everybody, therefore, gets a fair shot at the American Dream.\xc2\xa0 And that would apply to somebody paying 15 percent -- an effective tax rate of 15 percent on millions of dollars of income.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We don\'t know exactly the rate that Mitt Romney is paying because he has not released his tax returns.\xc2\xa0 He says that he hadn\'t -- he said last night in the debate that he hadn\'t planned on releasing his tax records but that most likely he\'s going to get asked to do it in April.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well -- what\'s the question?\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Chomping at the bit.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was anticipating.\xc2\xa0 But go ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why should he have to release his tax records?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s not for us to call on someone to release his tax records, but it is an established tradition for presidential candidates to release their tax records.\xc2\xa0 Then-Senator Obama did release multiple years of his tax records, and obviously has released his tax records, as tradition dictates, since he\'s been President.\xc2\xa0 And the President is not unique in that regard.\xc2\xa0 President George W. Bush, President Clinton, nominees for each party for years and years and years -- I think going back to 1976, this has been a very standard tradition.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good tradition.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why then-Senator Obama released his tax records going back I think six or seven years when he was a candidate for President in the 2008 election cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I believe -- I think it was a tradition that was initiated by then-presidential candidate George Romney, back in 1968, who released 12 years of tax records in \xe2\x80\x9968, as I understand it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on Bill\xe2\x80\x99s question about --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just happened to know that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow on Bill\xe2\x80\x99s question about Gingrich last night saying that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m a student of presidential politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- more people have been put on food stamps by Barack Obama than any President in history.\xc2\xa0 It is true that since Barack Obama has been President it\xe2\x80\x99s gone up 45 percent -- the number of people on food stamps.\xc2\xa0 So what is inaccurate about what Speaker Gingrich said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I answered this question already, Norah.\xc2\xa0 I think everyone understands that this economy took a body blow in 2007, 2008, from which we are still recovering, and that that resulted in an economy that was contracting, that was shrinking at an historic pace, an economy --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- 2131 that the number of people has gone up more than any other President.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re just saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that it was the result of the worst recession since the Great Depression that was brought on by economic policies that certainly predate this President, and that this President has been working very hard with his team to try to fix, and working with Congress to try to fix and correct, so that we can grow, as we have been growing on his watch, so that we can create private sector jobs, as we have been doing -- 3.2 million private sector jobs in the last many months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s the direction that we need to be going in.\xc2\xa0 Not the direction that we were headed into when he took office three years ago almost to the day, when the economy was in freefall, when there was talk of another Great Depression, there was talk of unemployment as high as 25 percent potentially.\xc2\xa0 Because of the actions that this President took working with Congress, we averted that absolute calamity.\xc2\xa0 But the impact of the recession has been severe, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been severe on the most vulnerable Americans, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been severe on middle-class Americans who have had to struggle to make ends meet as a result of it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why this President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is so keenly on helping those Americans deal with this economy, emerge from the recession on sounder economic footing, and why he believes that the folks who benefitted the most from the previous 10 years, who saw their share of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s wealth increase dramatically while middle-class Americans saw their incomes shrink or stagnate, that they need to pay their fair share -- which goes back to the Buffett rule, and the idea that someone making millions of dollars should not pay a lower effective tax rate than somebody making 50 grand or 75 grand.</p>\n<p>\n\tAri.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, the White House expressed opposition to the current form of the Online Privacy Act.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder whether it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to describe this as the White House siding with Silicon Valley over Hollywood?\xc2\xa0 And how important is it to the White House that some version of this bill pass?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that that\'s an accurate way to describe it.\xc2\xa0 I think what you saw in the exposition of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position over the weekend was a keen focus on the need to do something serious about online piracy, especially by foreign websites.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a serious problem that requires serious legislative responses.\xc2\xa0 But we will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cyber security risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative, global Internet.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach and the balance that we think needs to be taken as we work through this issue in Congress, and as the stakeholders who have a lot of important contributions to make to the debate engage with Congress as this legislation moves forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we made very clear over the weekend our opposition to what\xe2\x80\x99s called the DNS filter because we believe it creates a cyber security risk.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are a direct player in because obviously national security and cyber security are something that we are engaged in directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs far as the interests of private sector actors, I mean, there are legitimate concerns on both sides and those need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to maintain Internet freedom; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to do something serious about online piracy from foreign websites.\xc2\xa0 But our position on this, the approach that we believe is the best approach to take we did spell out over the weekend as a result of the \xe2\x80\x9cWe the People\xe2\x80\x9d petition.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before from the podium the President spends I think about 10 percent of his time or some small number like that on the presidential campaign.\xc2\xa0 So how did you know about George Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 12 years of tax returns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said that he spends.\xc2\xa0 I do a lot of reading, Ed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So your percentage is what, 30 or 40 percent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, I just read that in probably an article that one of your colleagues wrote.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many years -- maybe you do -- George Romney released of his college transcripts, but Republicans like to complain the President has not released his college transcripts.\xc2\xa0 What is the stated reason for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a question you could take --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve answered this a bunch.\xc2\xa0 I think that the tradition of releasing income tax records for presidential candidates, for serious potential nominees and nominees of the two parties is well established.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a law, but it\xe2\x80\x99s well established.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one that this President abided by when he was a candidate as senator.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that numerous Republicans and Democrats have abided by, and we just think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the Jobs Council, because it seems like the whole point has been -- the narrative has been the President is acting on jobs and other things as part of the whole \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d campaign.\xc2\xa0 Republicans, as you can imagine, are very excited this morning to read the report, and it has a whole section, the President\xe2\x80\x99s own Jobs Council saying that, as was talked about a little bit before, more oil and energy production -- and his own Jobs Council says that this could create hundreds of thousands of jobs, which has really been a Republican talking point on Keystone, that it could create if not hundreds maybe tens of thousands of jobs, something you disagree --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or maybe six or seven.\xc2\xa0 I mean, some jobs, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, okay.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s own Jobs Council now, though, seems to be agreeing with the Republicans that at least\xc2\xa0 -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t specifically mention Keystone, but a lot of jobs could be created.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the number, a lot.\xc2\xa0 So why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President signed the certification yet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the Jobs Council wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about Keystone specifically.\xc2\xa0 The Jobs Council was talking about the importance of expanding domestic oil and gas production, a goal this President shares and has expounded upon at length, and has taken action as a policy matter to demonstrate his commitment to, which --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the certification is sitting on his desk right now.\xc2\xa0 So you say he\xe2\x80\x99s taking action --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s ready to act on right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What certification?\xc2\xa0 You mean the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The 60-day clock started running on the President signing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the congressional -- the political ideological action by Congress to try to short-circuit a process that is long established --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Excuse me, but the President signed that into law, correct, even though you say it\xe2\x80\x99s ideological?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And you --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He signed it into law, though, right?\xc2\xa0 Did he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You apparently know that there is no alternate route yet in Nebraska, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but he signed this into law that he had 60 days to decide.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on his desk.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s acting on this. Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he acted on Keystone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the State Department runs this process, as you know, which is a precedent that long predates this administration.\xc2\xa0 The delay in the review was a result of concerns in Nebraska about the route by which the pipeline was meant to take -- the route the pipeline was meant to take through Nebraska and how it would affect the aquifer there -- concerns that were expressed by a number of stakeholders there, including the Republican governor of Nebraska.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the State Department decided that those concerns were legitimate and there needed to be an alternate route, that began another process, and this process requires the careful weighing of a variety of criteria, and that has always been the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tEveryone -- a lot of people, and certainly we made clear back in December that a political effort to short-circuit that process for ideological reasons would be counterproductive because a proper review that weighed all the important issues in this case could not be achieved in 60 days -- according to the State Department, which, again, runs this review process.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you.\xc2\xa0 I refer you to the State Department on where that stands now that the legislation has been signed into law.\xc2\xa0 But it is a fallacy to suggest that the President should sign into law something when there isn\xe2\x80\x99t even an alternate route identified in Nebraska and when the review process is -- there was an attempt to short-circuit the review process in a way that does not allow the kind of careful consideration of all the competing criteria here that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the council report say we could create hundreds of thousands of jobs if we wait three or four years?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to conflate --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation that you\xe2\x80\x99re creating jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to conflate something here that the Jobs Council didn\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xc2\xa0 The Jobs Council supports increased oil and gas production, which the President supports and, in fact, as I read out earlier, has taken action on.\xc2\xa0 The President believes, for example, that natural gas is an important component of our energy future and he is very supportive of exploiting that resource in this country in a safe and responsible manner going forward, as he is -- and as he has shown he is with regards to oil production here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also is committed to an all-of-the-above approach, including the development of clean energy resources here in the United States, all with the aim of reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is domestic production is up and imports are down.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to pursue this all-of-the-above approach because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for our national security and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for our economic security.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jerry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple things from the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction to the departure of his former ambassador to China from the Republican nomination process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any for you.\xc2\xa0 No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- much to the chagrin of a lot of people, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked politics with him today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any reaction -- I know this is probably another no -- but does the President have any reaction to the entry of Stephen Colbert into the -- (laughter) -- Republican process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have none to report.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a point to be made about super PACs?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just haven\'t had the -- I haven\'t spent my valuable time with him today talking about these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, if I could go 0-for-4, does the President have --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You could try one that I can answer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any concern -- let everyone else do that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any concerns about moving his acceptance speech of the Democratic nomination to the Bank of America stadium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President -- well, first of all, I would refer you for more information about this to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 But the President looks forward to delivering his acceptance speech in a stadium with a large capacity, much as he did in Denver in 2008.\xc2\xa0 That allows for greater participation by Americans from all walks of life.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason why he did it in 2008 at Invesco Field, and that\'s why he\'ll do it later this year in Charlotte.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the biggest venue, and he looks forward to holding that event and delivering his acceptance speech before tens of thousands of Americans in person, as well as, we certainly hope, many millions of Americans watching on television.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the choice was made based on the size of the venue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 He wants as many Americans as possible -- as was the case in 2008 -- to be able to participate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Want to move the State of the Union to a stadium?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That would be a great idea.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where does the State of the Union stand?\xc2\xa0 How far has he gotten along with it?\xc2\xa0 Will he be able to incorporate any of the long-range jobs proposals, particularly something like significant tax reform?\xc2\xa0 And is this speech this year, because it\'s a reelection year, a far more political approach than he would have last year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to preview any specifics.\xc2\xa0 I can say that he\'s obviously engaged in the process of deciding what he wants to say in the State of the Union address, the issues he wants to address, the policy proposals that he wants to include. I think that it will be, as is tradition, something that is very substantive, a speech that will contain a lot of policy substance.\xc2\xa0 And I think that he looks forward to the opportunity to describe his vision going forward to the American people about the kinds of things that he can do and that he can do with Congress to help the American economy grow and to help middle-class Americans feel more economically secure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, there are going to be a lot of opportunities, including in Charlotte, for the President to give political speeches.\xc2\xa0 This will be heavy on substance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but you talked a moment ago about this being a difficult environment in an election year for legislation.\xc2\xa0 Will he be more along the track of, I\'m going to do things my way without the help of Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he will echo the themes that we\'ve been talking about, he\'s been talking about, for a long time now -- I mean, broadly speaking, that he\'s been talking about since he began running for this office back in 2007, which is the need to help the middle class, which even prior to the beginning of the recession had been under a great deal of stress.\xc2\xa0 That will be a theme that you\'ll hear certainly at the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll talk about the need to do everything he can legislatively, working with Congress, as well as the imperative that he do everything he can using his executive authority to help the American people, to protect them, to give them greater economic security.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are themes that you\'ll hear.\xc2\xa0 But they are also themes that you have heard from him, and there will be a great deal of consistency in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sounds pretty familiar.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I -- again, there will be, I think -- there will be plenty of things within the speech that you will consider new and newsworthy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow on that and, in fact, a theme.\xc2\xa0 Will we hear the phrase, "win the future," or is that a line of the past?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to preview specific elements of the State of the Union address from here today.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 During the Jobs Council meeting, the President talked about the consolidation authority proposal that he\'s going to be sending to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is that legislative language complete, and is the goal to send that to the Hill before the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get an update for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that we will be sending proposed legislation to the Hill.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific day for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if there have been any phone calls, letters written, sort of ahead of sending the legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I expect there has been communication at least at a staff level, but also, I\'m sure, with some members about it -- those members who take a specific interest in it.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to Congress taking action on this.\xc2\xa0 This goes back to some of the questions that I had earlier about whether or not there\'s the potential for bipartisan cooperation in this election year, if you will.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is a perfect indication of an opportunity -- consolidating government, streamlining it, making it more efficient, and writing into law through the consolidation authority the requirement that the President who receives that authority use it in a way that reduces costs I think is something that every American should support and certainly that Republicans would normally be supportive of.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with any luck, Republicans as well as Democrats will support granting the President consolidation authority.\xc2\xa0 And then he can move on the first initiative, which Jeff Zients described for you last week, which is to bring under one roof the six agencies that deal with promoting American business and our competitiveness abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, on Iran, the OPEC governor there said on Tuesday that a European embargo on Iranian oil would be "economic suicide for Europe."\xc2\xa0 Does the administration still view the tone that\'s coming out of Iran to be suggestive of the fact that their currency is in a downward spiral?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a real concern that we could, in fact, be nearing some sort of a military engagement with them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there is no doubt that the concerted effort of this administration, working with our international partners and allies, to implement the most stringent sanctions against Iran in history have had a significant impact on Iran, on the Iranian economy, and have contributed to the fissures within the Iranian leadership that many of your colleagues have reported on.\xc2\xa0 They are also probably a precipitating factor in the kind of provocative statements and diversionary tactics that the Iranians have used to try to change the subject from the fact that they will not abide by their international obligations, and that is why they are the subject of this kind of pressure and this kind of isolation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will keep up that pressure, and we will keep up the effort to work with our allies and partners to further isolate Iran, even as we make clear that there is a solution here, and that is for Iran to get right with the international community; that is for Iran to abandon efforts to pursue nuclear weapons and to abide by its international commitments.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the path forward for Iran.\xc2\xa0 We will continue the effort to isolate and pressure Iran, working with our international partners going forward.\xc2\xa0 We think it\'s been effective.\xc2\xa0 And we hope that the Iranian leadership will choose the path of working with the international community to abide by its obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, that view of the sanctions doesn\'t seem to be shared by Prime Minister Netanyahu, who said yesterday that they would only be real and effective if they included petroleum sanctions, sanctions on the central bank.\xc2\xa0 And there were reports also that the administration had asked Israel not to take a unilateral early strike against Iran.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the U.S. and Israel are not on the same page on the speed and method of deterring Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the remarks that I believe the Prime Minister made to The Australian actually were of a different nature, where he talked about the effectiveness of the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly share that view.\xc2\xa0 Israel is a key ally and partner, and Israel has a profound interest in the effort to pressure Iran into abiding by its international obligations, as do many nations in the region and the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe, as I was just describing to Kristen, that that effort is unprecedented -- I mean, it is a demonstrable fact that it is unprecedented that we have the kind of international consensus, the likes of which we have not seen in the past -- certainly, the kind of consensus that did not exist prior to this President taking office -- and that that has made the fact of Iran\'s noncompliance all the clearer to the international community.\xc2\xa0 And it has contributed to the kind of international\xc2\xa0 -- or internal, rather, tension that you\'ve seen within Iran, and it\'s certainly had a dramatic impact -- a significant impact on the Iranian economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you take the Israeli position to be what was expressed in the interview with The Australian, and not what Netanyahu has said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m simply saying that you can cherry-pick some of the quotes.\xc2\xa0 We have worked very closely with the Israeli government, with the Prime Minister, as we do on a number of issues, and we believe that the approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken has put unprecedented pressure on Iran to change its behavior.\xc2\xa0 It has isolated Iran far more effectively than past efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope that -- and we will continue to ratchet up the pressure and the isolation, working with our allies, until Iran abides by its international obligations and works with the international community in a way that assures all of us that it is not and will not pursue a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tKen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President meets with the King, King Abdullah, shortly, how important will the effort to talk Israel out of a military strike on Iran be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any specifics to provide to you about a conversation that has not yet taken place.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of issues that the King and the President will discuss, including the Middle East peace process, including Syria, including the King\xe2\x80\x99s efforts towards reform in Jordan, which we support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note with regard to Syria that one of the signs of desperation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Assad regime is the fact that they -- that the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani, visited Damascus, and the fact that Assad is relying on essentially his last friend for support in his repression against his own people I think makes all the clearer that his time has come.\xc2\xa0 He must go.\xc2\xa0 He must step down.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Italian cruise ship?\xc2\xa0 The Italian ship?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Connie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Have you been in touch with the Prime Minister or Italian authorities?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comments?\xc2\xa0 And does this disaster make any statements on Americans taking ships that might be under foreign control, that they\'re in danger perhaps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie, I would refer you to the State Department where I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been handling questions about Americans aboard the cruise ship.\xc2\xa0 But this is obviously a terrible tragedy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen the horrific images and our hearts go out to the families of the victims -- both American and from everywhere else.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the other questions you had about it, I would refer you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is President Obama going to call the Italian --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on foreign leader calls.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Needless to say that the State of the Union will be focusing on domestic issues, the economy, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 How much of this State of the Union will be focused on an international audience, especially in terms of what my colleagues just mentioned, as well as the euro and the European countries being downgraded by S&amp;P?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will ask you to listen and read the speech.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview it for you here.\xc2\xa0 As part of the tradition of the State of the Union address, I think it will be broadly cast, but I don\'t want to get into percentages about how much on domestic issues, how much on international, which ones have more attention.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys judge that after he speaks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to ask you about a settlement that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reached early this month with a military contractor called Dyncorp.\xc2\xa0 A straight employee there was allegedly harassed based on his perceived sexual orientation, and when he complained the company did nothing.\xc2\xa0 He was awarded $155,000, but the company isn\xe2\x80\x99t required to change its non-discrimination policy to include protections based on sexual orientation.\xc2\xa0 Dyncorp receives more than 96 percent of its revenue from federal contracts that amount to $2 billion each year, making it the 32nd largest federal contractor.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a problem with companies having policies allowing this kind of anti-gay harassment if they receive this amount of federal money?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, why don\'t I take that question because I know none of the details that you just described, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\xc2\xa0 -- I don\'t want to make a general statement about it since I know nothing about the specifics.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- <strike>very misleading</strike> generally speaking --*</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to do -- you just listed a number of details about a case that I don\'t have any information on, so why don\'t we take that question and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Washington Times.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, back on food stamps for a second.\xc2\xa0 What policies did Newt Gingrich advocate as speaker 15 years ago that now are resulting in more people --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I said that the economic policies that contributed to the great recession were supported by and are being proposed by I believe all of the leading contenders for the Republican nomination.\xc2\xa0 I mean that\'s a fact, so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What specific policies --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, are you contesting that the economic policy -- that economic policy had nothing to do with -- I mean the approach, say, to regulating Wall Street that was taken by -- in the lead-up to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, that\'s not an approach this President shares.\xc2\xa0 And yet we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from every major Republican candidate that they would abolish Dodd-Frank, the reforms -- the Wall Street reforms that this President signed into law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are -- astoundingly you hear from some folks who are out running for office that they would not only either water down or abolish those important Wall Street reforms, but they would further reduce regulation of the very financial sector that contributed so mightily to the economic hardship of so many millions and millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just an approach we disagree with, and we look forward to the debate with whomever emerges from the primary process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, and then all the way in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Some supporters of the Occupy movement on the Hill this morning had a huge banner saying, "Liberals admit it, Obama let you down."\xc2\xa0 How worried is the President that the most liberal of his supporters won\xe2\x80\x99t show up on Election Day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 These are questions I would direct to the campaign.\xc2\xa0 This President is focused on the job he needs to do as President of the United States, and he is focused primarily, when it comes to domestic policy, on continuing the recovery, improving growth, improving job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have had some positive signs in the economic picture, but we have a lot more work to do.\xc2\xa0 We have over the last many months seen the creation of 3.2 million private sector jobs, but we have a lot more that need to be created in this country so that we can get to the point where every American who wants a job and is looking for a job can find a job.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what this President is focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that he looks forward to the debate about who has the better economic plan, who has the best blueprint for our economic future.\xc2\xa0 But that time hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s now focused on the work that he can do as President of the United States, working with Congress, working with his -- working through his executive authority, working with the private sector, to do what he can do improve the American economy and improve the job picture, as well as, obviously, our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he understands that they\'re -- some of them are very disappointed with the type of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think this President is very focused on the job he needs to do.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that Americans of every persuasion support the idea that we need to take action to help the economy grow, support the idea that we need to do the kinds of things that can put more Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0 That message that the President brought when he put forward the American Jobs Act was supported by a broad majority of the American people, including progressives, as well as independents and even conservatives.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep pushing that agenda, keep pushing that approach, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll let the politics of this take care of itself.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy birthday to the First Lady.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR.
