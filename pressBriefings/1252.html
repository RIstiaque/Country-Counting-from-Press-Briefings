WET<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Good evening, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re a little bit tight on time, but we have an on-the-record briefing with our Ambassador to NATO, Ivo Daalder, as well as Ben Rhodes, who you know from the National Security Council, our deputy national security advisor for strategic communications.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll really just turn it over to Ivo.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say by way of introduction that today we focused on the NATO Strategic Concept and unified position for the alliance going forward in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow we obviously have the session in the morning that will focus on aligning our approach to Afghanistan, and then the NATO-Russia Council.\xc2\xa0 And the President also has a bilateral meeting tomorrow with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 And then in the afternoon he has the U.S.-EU Summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say before I turn it over to Ivo is just to highlight -- and the President just spoke to this in his remarks -- really the extraordinary progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made over the course of the year in resolving some very, very important and difficult issues.\xc2\xa0 Chief among them, which Ivo can speak to, is the agreement on missile defense, which obviously is an issue that our administration has been interested in from day one.\xc2\xa0 Since the President rolled out his phased adaptive approach, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working this really hard with our allies.\xc2\xa0 And I think we saw a lot of that work bear fruit today, and Ivo can speak to that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd similarly, you\xe2\x80\x99re of course aware of the efforts we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on the Russia reset, which is another presidential priority, which will be manifested in the NATO-Russia Council meetings tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think what we see is an advancement of core Obama administration objectives that have also opened the door to taking this alliance to the next stage so that it\xe2\x80\x99s prepared for the 21st century.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, though, Ivo can make some comments and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 The core concept of this administration has been to rebuilding our alliances and partnerships.\xc2\xa0 And when we got, a year and a half ago, together in the last NATO summit, the leaders then, led by President Obama, set the goal of making this alliance relevant for the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And we were hoping that we could achieve that here in Lisbon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, I think we can say that we succeeded.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even self-evident.\xc2\xa0 Just a few weeks ago and a few months ago, there were differences within this alliance on some big issues -- nuclear weapons, missile defense, partnership, Russia -- appeared to suggest that this alliance couldn\xe2\x80\x99t unify around a set of central concepts and central themes that would allow this alliance to work together among the 28 in the 21st century.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we have done that.\xc2\xa0 We did it today just a few hours ago when we adopted the new Strategic Concept, which you will be able to receive shortly.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been -- just been handed out.\xc2\xa0 It is a crisp, clean, concrete, concise document that lays out how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet the core requirements of collective defense and cooperative security by working with others.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A central component on that is how do we deal with not only existing threats but new threats -- new threats of cyber, new threats of missile proliferation, new threats coming from states failing and how do we work that together.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A key component of that is the decision to build a NATO missile defense system that will provide the protection of NATO and the United States, of NATO Europe and the United States, against ballistic missiles of all territory and populations.\xc2\xa0 That is a key decision that this administration set itself as a goal when the President in December 2009 announced the phased adaptive approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Previous administrations have tried to get a European missile defense system.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded.\xc2\xa0 This administration decided that it needed to put in place a defense of Europe and the United States and do it together with our allies.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In contrast of previous administrations and in contrast of previous systems, this is a system that will defend Europe and the United States -- all of Europe and all of the United States -- and it will do so under the cover of this alliance.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is a major commitment that the United States is making to the defense of its allies and it\xe2\x80\x99s a major commitment of the allies to the defense of the United States and of Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that at this time not in contrast to or in conflict with Russia, but with Russia because tomorrow President Medvedev will come here and he will be invited to cooperate on missile defense with NATO, with the very system that we have put into place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in contrast to the narrative one has heard that somehow missile defense was a problem in U.S.-Russian or indeed NATO-Russian relationships, missile defense is now a means to foster greater cooperation with Russia.\xc2\xa0 In order to get that, we had to have a decision among the 28 allies for missile defense.\xc2\xa0 That decision was made today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, you will see tomorrow this alliance united together in support of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy with regard to Afghanistan, a general view that where we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in Afghanistan is a direction that the President set out back last December, and that NATO is now embracing not only in words but indeed in deeds by providing the capabilities necessary to succeed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think what we have is an alliance ready for the 21st century, dealing with the threats of the 21st century -- missile proliferation, cyber -- major movement on that as well -- while doing it in cooperation not only with our partners here in Europe but also NATO\xe2\x80\x99s partners beyond Europe, including in Russia and in Afghanistan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, let me -- be happy to take some questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does this missile defense shield protect the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 How does it protect the -- this particular missile defense system will in the first instance protect U.S. forces deployed in Europe; we have 80,000-plus forces.\xc2\xa0 And it is fully integrated and part of the homeland missile defense system that we have in the -- deployed already in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the later phases, because this is a phased system, and if the threat of long-range missiles -- ICBMs -- develops, this system will be capable of actually intercepting those missiles coming from the Middle East and *(be countered by the system based in)southeastern Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- from Europe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 From Europe, will be able to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 When asking the questions, could you speak up because I think we have this mic here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For the benefit of our transcribers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add, Margaret, if you recall when we rolled out our phased adaptive approach, it was based on the threat assessment that the immediate threat or the nearest-term threat was the medium-range ballistic missiles emanating from the Middle East region.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the phased approach takes that into account on the front end.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just underscore that there was a lot of skepticism when we rolled out our missile defense program, questions as to whether it would garner support from our European allies, questions as to whether it could achieve something which has not been achieved before, which is full coverage of the European populations.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at where the debate was on missile defense when we rolled out our system last September to where it is today, it points to an incredible amount of progress in terms of going from a United States plan that we put on the table to a plan that is now embedded in a core alliance capability that, again, will protect all European populations as well as supplementing our efforts to protect the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just clarify one thing that Ivo said?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that this system over time that is to be built in Europe would have the capability to intercept long-range missiles aimed at the United States from here in Europe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a phased system.\xc2\xa0 It has four phases.\xc2\xa0 In the last phase, the missiles deployed in Poland and/or -- and Romania, which will be -- will be upgraded, will be more modern versions, will be able to intercept ICBMs being targeted at the United States from those locations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Let me go over here to Julie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just looking forward to (inaudible) on the Afghan policy, there are some people who are equating Afghan (inaudible) the end of NATO\xe2\x80\x99s combat role in 2014.\xc2\xa0 Are those one and the same?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re not one and the same.\xc2\xa0 In the transition strategy that we will adopt tomorrow as an alliance is a strategy that says that in the early 2011 we will begin the process of the Afghans getting into the lead, and we hope that by the end of 2014 the entire country Afghanistan will be in the lead.\xc2\xa0 In the lead means that it will still have to rely on support from ISAF forces.\xc2\xa0 How, where, what is all dependent on the conditions on the ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it may well be that there are large parts of Afghanistan where the Afghanistans are not only in the lead -- they\xe2\x80\x99re in control.\xc2\xa0 But there may be other parts in which they are still only in the lead and will rely on ISAF support capabilities, continued training, of course, of Afghan forces, and the like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But over time, the weight of who is responsible will increase in terms of the Afghans doing more and more and the international community, including U.S. forces, having to do less and less.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Just to add to that, I think the core point here is that we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be addressing both the process by which transition takes place -- so literally how do we implement handover to Afghan lead in different parts of the country -- and then (inaudible) alignment on the general time frame which is a time frame that begins in 2011 and then reaches the goal that President Karzai set and that the international community has embraced of full Afghan lead responsibility in 2014.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So between the beginning of next year when this transition will begin to 2014, there will be a process of transition to Afghan lead in different parts of the country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously begin in places that are more ripe for that transition to take place.\xc2\xa0 But, again, just as the United States is beginning its transition in July of 2011, the alliance is going to together align our approaches to transition from, again, the beginning of next year through 2014.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be under the impression that NATO\xe2\x80\x99s role (inaudible) beyond 2014?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think -- our view, again, is that the Afghans will have the lead responsibility for security of the country.\xc2\xa0 The nature of the continued support that NATO and ISAF forces provide, be it training assistance and a variety of support, is something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be determined at that time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Steve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 In terms of (inaudible) EU-NATO cooperation, I presume that\xe2\x80\x99s (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 What did the Turks want and what did they get?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 The Turks are one of 28 allies.\xc2\xa0 Like every other ally, they were arguing for their position; they argued hard.\xc2\xa0 And in the end, they joined consensus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did they get?\xc2\xa0 They got an alliance decision.\xc2\xa0 They got an alliance decision that -- for missile defense -- that will protect all of -- will provide -- where the aim is to provide full coverage of all territory in NATO Europe as we move ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they wanted.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this decision will give them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the particular command and control arrangements, Turkey knows and everyone else knows that these are now the decisions that we start working on.\xc2\xa0 We needed to make a fundamental decision that the goal needed to be established of providing the protection for allied territories and populations.\xc2\xa0 That goal has now been set.\xc2\xa0 The decision that NATO should be in the business of doing this has been set.\xc2\xa0 And the mechanics of how to do it is something that we will work it into in the years -- in the months and years ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to NATO-EU, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, the decision was made to agree on a concept of how NATO and the European Union -- or actually, not a concept, a vision -- of how NATO and the European Union ought to cooperate, in which Turkey decided to join consensus today by saying it is our view that NATO and the EU need to work together as strategic partners and to do so by having the non-EU allies being involved in those operations.\xc2\xa0 And you will find the paragraph in the Strategic Concept to be forward-leaning, aspirational and visionary.\xc2\xa0 The actual implementation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t only depend on NATO, but now NATO has said we want to work together with the European Union and Turkey in a major and an important decision decided to be part of that process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And President Obama was able to speak on the margins to President Gul and communicate his appreciation for the Turkish decision to support this initiative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. HAMMER:\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I understood what you said.\xc2\xa0 You said this will be done not in contrast with Russia but rather with Russia -- (inaudible).\xc2\xa0 I just want to check and make sure, are you -- do you feel -- it sounds like you feel reasonably confident that President Medvedev (inaudible) support (inaudible).<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 AMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 What I said is we made a decision for NATO to defend NATO territory, and as part of that decision we invite Russia to cooperate with NATO on missile defense.\xc2\xa0 This is an invitation that we have now formally given to Russia.\xc2\xa0 Russia will come here tomorrow, and I believe that we will find that Russia and NATO will now decide that this is a time where we move together forward on how to cooperate, start asking those questions and begin answering them, rather than saying that this is an issue, which has long been a problem in the relationship.\xc2\xa0 Rather than being an issue for conflict, it is now an issue for cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the actual way in which we\xe2\x80\x99re going to cooperate is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start working out starting the day after tomorrow when we get back to Brussels.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And as the President mentioned, Christi, part of this is also the notion that we share threats with Russia, and that broadens the basis for this cooperation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d just return to the point that the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re here now in November 2010 talking about a missile defense system that covers all of Europe and cooperates with Russia potentially on these issues is in stark contrast to where we were when we entered into these discussions a year ago and in September when the President rolled out his phased adaptive approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with the ability to move the ball forward, both as an alliance on missile defense and in bringing Russia into the conversation through the NATO-Russia Council.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, could you address (inaudible) START treaty (inaudible) discussion here?\xc2\xa0 And the President in his comments just now alluded to the Polish Foreign Minister\xe2\x80\x99s comment, and as he left he indicated that some other heads of government (inaudible) issue a statement also, in effect, endorsing the New START treaty.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us more about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think that what the President was referring to is that both the START treaty and the security that it provides in terms of a verification regime with Russia is in the interests of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 And similarly, the reset with Russia has enhanced European security broadly, because you have, again, a more cooperative framework between Europe and Russia.\xc2\xa0 And that includes, again, our Central and Eastern European neighbors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the Foreign Minister\xe2\x80\x99s comments were very strong in pointing out that both the START treaty and the verification regime that it contains, as well as the broader effort that we\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken, is in the interest of European security and in their interest.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be, we\xe2\x80\x99d anticipate, statements from other leaders.\xc2\xa0 The President has had comments -- I\xe2\x80\x99d just point to one.\xc2\xa0 Chancellor Merkel and him had a good conversation about the importance of moving forward with New START.\xc2\xa0 And I think he had a number of those conversations on the margins.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think the broad consensus, again, is that having a treaty in place and ratified that allows for a verification regime, that allows for U.S. inspectors on the ground and that, again, responsibly restored reductions in our deployed nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles, enhances the security of all of Europe, just as it enhances American security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, again, the ability of the United States and Russia to work together, but also NATO and Russia to reset their relationship is in the interest of all of Europe, because it adds stability to, again, European security and also allows us to move forward with issues like Iran sanctions and Afghan transit that have been fundamental priorities for us.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad sense that New START is both in our security interest on the merits of the treaty itself, and that also the approach that has been taken between the United States and Russia, NATO and Russia, is in the broader interest of the alliance as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would expect additional comments from leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes (inaudible) with the President, if this is not going to go through now, so how it affects not just the relationship with Russia but also with NATO?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, our view is that we are working hard to see that the Senate approves the New START treaty this year.\xc2\xa0 It does have very broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 That includes former officials like Colin Powell and George Shultz and Henry Kissinger who are with the -- some of them were with the President the other day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt also includes bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lugar, Republican, has been the most outspoken and eloquent spokesperson for this treaty in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 14-4 with bipartisan support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are still working hard to get it passed with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the reason that that can take place is because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the national interest -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a democratic or Republican treaty or idea.\xc2\xa0 Just as the New START treaty is in the interests of all of NATO, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the American people, broadly speaking.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with Republican senators, as well as Democratic senators, to work to get the START treaty passed this year, again, because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the alliance, and it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of global security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The agreement -- the Strategic Concept said that NATO will remain a nuclear alliance.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the understanding (inaudible) Germany and France, about the intersection between deterrence and missile defense and whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten (inaudible) to keep its nuclear arsenal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a Strategic Concept that lays out how to think about nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And what it does is it embraces the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision in Prague, which on the one hand sets a very clear objective, which is to create the conditions of a world without nuclear weapons right there on the first page, and at the same time recognizes that as long as there are nuclear weapons, NATO will remain a nuclear alliance and that nuclear weapons will remain a core part of the deterrence strategy that this alliance has.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that was the essence of the balance that had to be struck -- on the one hand, a firm commitment to seeking a better world, one without nuclear weapons; and on the other hand, an understanding that as long as we live in a world with nuclear weapons, you needed to have a capability that was safe, secure and effective.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are not and did not discuss what the future of the posture is.\xc2\xa0 You will see in the Strategic Concept a commitment to continue the review of the posture in the future.\xc2\xa0 And indeed, we will have a posture review, not only of our nuclear weapons but indeed of all our capabilities for deterrence and defense starting next year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that countries that want to get rid of their nuclear arsenal are going to hide under your nuclear umbrella?\xc2\xa0 So where the rest of the world can continue to reduce its nuclear arsenal, but you\xe2\x80\x99re forced to defend all of Europe.\xc2\xa0 It says in the document that the United States remains the main provider of deterrence for the alliance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 And the United States is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR DAALDER:\xc2\xa0 The United States has been the main provider of the nuclear deterrent for a very long time.\xc2\xa0 That sentence actually comes straight out of the 1999 Strategic Concept, so there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new here.\xc2\xa0 And it is our view that the responsibilities and risks of nuclear weapons within this alliance need to be shared widely.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat is the view of the United States, and indeed it is the view of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 As long as nuclear weapons exist, this alliance will remain a nuclear alliance.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Strategic Concept affirms.\xc2\xa0 And with that come responsibilities that each of us take on as members of this alliance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add that it gets to -- from talking to those in the session, there was broad support for the framework laid out in Prague by the President, again, which is one that underscores the need to move in the direction of a world without nuclear weapons, that takes concrete steps as embedded in the START treaty, for instance, but also maintains a nuclear deterrent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this gets to the credibility question that was asked, because I think the credibility of the President is manifest in the fact that if you look across the board at the embrace of the Prague agenda, at the support, again, for this missile defense system, for the fact that the NATO-Russia Council is beginning again, these are the President\xe2\x80\x99s core priorities manifested in the agenda of the alliance.\xc2\xa0 They engender broad international support.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think that speaks to the fact that his credibility is substantial enough to drive the agenda here in Lisbon and to unify the alliance behind a core set of priorities that we have and that our European friends have that provides a basis for us to move forward together.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t8:13 P.M.
