CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, let me just take note of something.\xc2\xa0 As some of you probably saw last night, the Speaker of the House gave an interview on television, and in it expressed openness to eliminating unwarranted tax breaks for the oil and gas industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAs you know, this is something the President has long supported and that he has placed in his last two budget proposals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFollowing up on the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, the President sent a letter earlier today to the leaders of the House and Senate urging them to take immediate action to eliminate unwarranted tax breaks for the oil and gas industry and to use those dollars to invest in clean energy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe obviously believes very strongly, the President does, that this is of special urgency given the spike in gas prices that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that have once again reminded us what our dependence on foreign oil can do and how it directly -- has a direct impact on the wallets and pocketbooks of everyday Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so he strongly urges the leaders of Congress to take up legislation to eliminate those subsidies.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the oil and gas companies are all announcing their profits this week.\xc2\xa0 They are expected to be quite large.\xc2\xa0 And while we certainly are glad to see companies making a profit, we do not believe that given the size of those profits, record profits in some cases, that they need to be subsidized by the American taxpayer, especially in these times of constrained budgets and especially when we need to use some of those dollars to invest in clean energy technology so that we can build the industries of the future, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and create jobs in America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll start here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 First, a follow-up on that.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that cutting those subsidies to oil companies would do anything to affect gas prices in the short term?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Ben, the President has said and been quite candid about the fact that there are no short-term silver bullet -- well, there are no silver bullets here -- to solve the problem that is created by our dependence on oil and our dependence on foreign oil in particular.\xc2\xa0 He has -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he has, in quite deliberate fashion, laid out a long-term energy strategy that includes reducing our dependence on foreign oil by a third by 2025.\xc2\xa0 It includes diversifying our sources of energy and is -- including increasing domestic development as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s done safely and diversifying to a variety of other sources -- biofuels, for example.\xc2\xa0 It includes the investments that this President made through the Recovery Act in lithium battery technology and other means of clean energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo while there is no silver bullet, what a situation like we\xe2\x80\x99re going through now reminds us is that we cannot simply wait for this spike in oil prices to subside, go into a state of sustained amnesia about what the problem is, and then wake up again in a few years when the prices spike again and wonder what we need to do, because we need a long-term strategy, we need to come together in a bipartisan way to create an energy policy that reduces our dependence on foreign oil, diversifies our energy sources, creates jobs in America, and positions the United States for the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But so then the current context, these high gas prices, and probably going to be higher come summer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a reminder of the need for this long-term plan that the President advocates and that\xe2\x80\x99s where the tax subsidies come in.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not suggesting that even if Congress were to act on this, that the consumers would see a difference anytime soon -- is that fair?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are -- he is very focused on this issue of gas prices.\xc2\xa0 He is obviously looking at different things that need to be done or could be done, perhaps, to have an impact in the short or medium term.\xc2\xa0 But the reality is that we have a dependence on foreign oil that holds us hostage to the kind of spikes in the oil markets that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen lately that drives up gas prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to finding a long-term solution to this problem and not doing what tends to happen here, which is whenever we see these spikes -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in the past; we\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen this movie before when politicians run out and promise a variety of measures that will bring the price of oil down or gas down, and when those prices subside, usually because of the way the market works, everybody forgets that we have a problem.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to a long-term energy policy that addresses the long-term problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to shift briefly to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Any update on possibilities of sanctions against Assad and his inner circle?\xc2\xa0 Is anything imminent?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I would tell you is that, as I did yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing a range of possible policy options, including targeted sanctions, to respond to the crackdown and make clear that this behavior by the Syrian government is unacceptable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe strongly oppose the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of its citizens and we continue to oppose its continued destabilizing behavior, including support for terrorism and terrorist groups.\xc2\xa0 We call on President Assad to change course now and heed the calls of his own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about what those options are that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing.\xc2\xa0 They include potentially targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also, following up on some questions I got yesterday, consulting with our international partners about other actions that could be taken.\xc2\xa0 When we do something like this -- for example, when we seek to employ targeted financial measures -- we try to multilaterize and they tend to be more effective when they\xe2\x80\x99re multilateral, or certainly can have a greater impact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of scope of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now as we look at the options available to us.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of timing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on timing right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to go back on the oil and gas subsidies question.\xc2\xa0 What Speaker Boehner said last night was that this was something worth taking a look at, but since the President has sent that letter to congressional leadership, Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office is saying that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would actually raise taxes and increase prices at the pump.\xc2\xa0 How do you overcome the differences, when you get down to the details, of how to implement such cuts?\xc2\xa0 And how quickly do you think such action could take place, a deal could be reached?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here are tax breaks for the oil companies, a variety of tax breaks for oil companies that are simply, at a time of multibillion-dollar profits due to the high price of gas, are unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue that, given where the price of oil is now, that there\xe2\x80\x99s a need for subsidies of the oil and gas industry.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure some of you know, oil company CEOs themselves have said in the past that they do not need these kind of incentives to continue to explore, for example.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tFormer Shell CEO, John Hofmeister, just earlier this year said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the face of sustained high oil prices, it was not an issue for large companies of needing the subsidies to entice us into looking for and producing more oil.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I just think that in a time when Americans are suffering every time they go to the gas station and pull out their credit card or their cash to pay a very high price for a tank of gas, to then tell them that actually we need to spend $4 billion a year of their money to subsidize oil companies who this week are reporting massive profits is just not a credible argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so the President, as you know, has supported eliminating these subsidies for quite some time. He certainly believes that now more than ever the argument resonates.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why we heard the Speaker say he was open to that, and why we\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen CEOs of oil and gas companies acknowledge that the subsidies are unnecessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President says he wants immediate action.\xc2\xa0 He sees room for compromise with the Republicans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he wants immediate action, and he hopes that the openness that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the Hill to taking action will lead to a concrete result that will eliminate these subsidies and free that money up for the kind of investments in energy that can alleviate this problem in the long term, or help to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, my colleague, Gary Tuchman, just went to Hawaii and established again that there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence suggesting that the President, in fact, was born in the United States.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, Donald Trump persists, other critics, and last night Trump was on CNN saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s been told the birth certificate is missing, that it\xe2\x80\x99s either not there or has been taking out -- taken out somehow, and this is a problem for the President.\xc2\xa0 When the White House hears this continued claim, what does it say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I would say that we have a lot of problems confronting us.\xc2\xa0 I think CNN recently did a highly credible piece on an established fact, which is that the President was born in the United States of America, and this was a settled issue.\xc2\xa0 It is unfortunate that for whatever reason that instead of focusing on our economy, on our continued joblessness in this country, on the need to reduce our deficits and get our fiscal house in order, on the need for a clean energy -- for an energy policy and for investments in clean energy technology, on the need for an education reform strategy that positions our children for the 21st century, on the challenges that face us internationally, that this is the subject of -- that gets any kind of serious attention.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question on that, though.\xc2\xa0 As part of that CNN story you mentioned we noted that there is a certificate of live birth, which is considered in the state of Hawaii settled that he was born in the United States, period.\xc2\xa0 However, Trump and others keep saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s not the actual birth certificate, and as you know, Hawaii Department of Health says that you can request a birth certificate; you put in a Freedom of Information request, and within a few weeks you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a copy out of the vault.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President do that?\xc2\xa0 Is it because you believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction from these other issues?\xc2\xa0 Is it because he just thinks they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep moving the goal post?\xc2\xa0 Why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what do you think, Ed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the President\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you think they might keep moving the goal post?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re the President\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you what you think.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a distraction, obviously.\xc2\xa0 This is a settled issue.\xc2\xa0 The birth certificate that the campaign put up online has been available for everyone to see around the globe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same birth certificate you get to get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.\xc2\xa0 Anybody who was born in Hawaii who asks for their birth certificate gets the same thing that the campaign and the White House has provided to the press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I just think this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a distraction, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an unfortunate distraction from the issues that I think most Americans care about.\xc2\xa0 I think anybody who is watching this exchange in the West Wing of the White House would be appalled -- or most Americans would be appalled that this is what concerns us here when, in fact, there are so many major issues that are facing this country that need to be addressed by the President and by the Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to the letter that President Obama sent to the leaders on the Hill on the need to eliminate oil subsidies, he said immediate action, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated that from the podium.\xc2\xa0 Can you define that in any more clear terms as far as the deadline?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned legislation, but does this have a role in the conversations going forward on deficit and debts?\xc2\xa0 How is that going to move that ball down the field?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly -- look, immediate action means what it says, which is when Congress comes back let\xe2\x80\x99s take action legislatively to eliminate those subsidies.\xc2\xa0 It is also part of the larger discussion.\xc2\xa0 It is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposals.\xc2\xa0 It is part of any, we think, balanced approach towards reducing our deficits and getting our spending and revenues in line in a way that puts our fiscal house in order, reduces our long-term debt, allows for the investments that we need in education, research and development, energy technology, to be economically competitive and dominant in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And that is part of the bigger discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut with the current environment and the fact that the Speaker of the House, leader of the Republicans in the Congress, expressed an openness to addressing this issue last night, the President wrote a letter to say, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House had heard from the Speaker or anyone on his staff before?\xc2\xa0 Because they seem to be walking a little bit back on what he said to ABC yesterday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But he obviously said it on television last night.\xc2\xa0 He also expressed a sentiment that we think is very important, where he said that we have a revenue shortage, the federal government has a revenue shortage, which is a -- a revenue problem, rather, which is I think a recognition of what the President has been saying and others, Democrats and some Republicans, that when we approach this long-term deficit and debt problem and we look at fiscal reform, everything has to be on the table.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement spending, spending through the tax code, defense spending, and obviously interest on the debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on gas prices.\xc2\xa0 The President has acknowledged this himself last week at a fundraiser in Los Angeles -- we\xe2\x80\x99re wondering if you can respond to the new ABC News/Washington Post poll that said that 53 percent of those who are feeling serious hardship from the resulting gas prices say they definitely will not vote for President Obama in 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t look at this as an issue of electoral politics in 18 months.\xc2\xa0 We look at this as an issue of hardship for average Americans today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think when somebody sticks the credit card in the pump or pays the cashier the cash for the tank of gas, that they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about an election in 2012.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about the hardship it causes them, the pinch it places on their family budgets.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about that now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very concerned about it within the context of the need for a long-term energy policy, and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it in the context of the need to continue to lift up Americans as we recover from -- working Americans and middle-class Americans -- as we recover from this historic recession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo this is a -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to introduce electoral politics into it to make it a matter of great concern, because we are concerned about it here today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the matter of electoral politics, you say you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about hardship for the average American today.\xc2\xa0 You might as well go ahead and concede that this action would have absolutely no effect on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I never suggested and the President has always made clear that there are -- that our options are limited in terms of having a direct effect, an immediate effect, on bringing down gas prices.\xc2\xa0 And certainly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not by 2012.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- certainly having a long -- having -- removing oil and gas subsidies, removing subsidies from corporations that are reporting record profits and using that money to invest in a long-term energy strategy -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to lower the gas price at the pump tomorrow, but what it will do, what the President believes is essential to do, is create a situation where we have the right policies in place and the right diversity of energy sources so that we are insulated from these kinds of price shocks in the future.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s very farsighted.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focus of his -- that\xe2\x80\x99s his objective with this proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, are we giving or are we thinking about giving any kind of support to the people who are protesting there, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s communications equipment, money, Internet-breaking software?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, right now we are, as I said, looking at a range of options, including targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to specify the other options in addition to targeted sanctions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which would be beyond sanctions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand.\xc2\xa0 I said a range of options, including targeted sanctions, but not limited to targeted sanctions.\xc2\xa0 But at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not prepared to enumerate the other options that are on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say whether we\xe2\x80\x99re giving them any kind of help yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of or that I can announce.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal for rolling back the oil subsidies, Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman says it would be actually counterproductive.\xc2\xa0 He says it would raise taxes and increase the price at the pump.\xc2\xa0 Is he wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if in order to -- yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong in the sense that if you\xe2\x80\x99re telling me that eliminating a loophole in the tax code is somehow burdensome on the tax responsibilities of a major corporation that\xe2\x80\x99s announcing billions of dollars of profits -- apparently $100 million per day in profits -- I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s one way to look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think the fact is that the oil companies have substantial capacity to get along without the American taxpayer subsidizing them to the tune of more than $4 billion a year; more than $43 billion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t have that kind of money to throw around when we have other urgent priorities.\xc2\xa0 We need to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 And it is made doubly apparent by the fact that these companies are reporting such substantial profits this week, and those profits are driven in large part by the serious spike in oil prices and gasoline prices that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent weeks and months.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, Senator Manchin has signed on to a couple of bipartisan proposals, one that would cap spending, another that would implement a balanced budget amendment.\xc2\xa0 I presume you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with these proposals.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s take?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we -- the starting point is that we share with a number of members of Congress a great concern about the need to reduce spending, with the goal of reducing our deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat we don\xe2\x80\x99t think is necessary is to amend the Constitution or to pass a across-the-board spending reduction measure that will, for example, in both cases, seriously under-fund Medicare and Social Security, and does the exact opposite in many ways of what the President has said is necessary, which is take a balanced approach to our long-term deficit and debt problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we don\xe2\x80\x99t support that.\xc2\xa0 I will remind you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s deficit-reduction plan that he put forward in his speech last week contains within it a debt failsafe proposal.\xc2\xa0 And what it does is -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it will be necessary if Congress takes the right actions, based on his plan -- but if, for example, the economic picture does not turn out to be as we predict, it\xe2\x80\x99s a failsafe but it -- the trigger is the ratio of debt to GDP.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very wonky, I know, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a ratio of debt to GDP.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBecause the issue here is not spending for -- cutting spending for the sake of cutting spending.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is driving our deficit and debt down.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan does just that and has that debt failsafe, that protection measure, that if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the ratio of debt to GDP down to where it should be by a date certain, that trigger will take effect and it will obligate Congress to reduce the deficit through both spending in the tax code and direct spending, as opposed to the kind of measures that you are asking about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could, on a third measure.\xc2\xa0 It turns out a guy named bin Qumu who was held at Gitmo for a number of years is now leading the Libyan rebels, or a group of Libyan rebels, and very supportive, apparently, of the NATO-led effort in that country now.\xc2\xa0 But this is a person who apparently trained with al Qaeda prior to 9/11.\xc2\xa0 How much do we know about the Libyan opposition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along, Wendell, that we are confident of two things.\xc2\xa0 One, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with -- directly with members of the Libyan opposition and especially members of the council who we believe are credible and have made assertions about their goals that we can support, in terms of reforms that would lead to democratic elections and a representative government that would be responsive to the aspirations of the Libyan people and respect the rights of the Libyan people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe have also said that we obviously do not have -- I mean, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any doubt that -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not making this -- let me make clear, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying this in regard to this particular individual.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment or knowledge about this specific individual -- but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the motives or politics of every member of the opposition in that country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSavannah.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that there is no silver bullet and the President already asked for these oil and gas subsidies to be eradicated in next year\xe2\x80\x99s budget and last year\xe2\x80\x99s budget, is there any element of what the President is doing with regard to gas prices that\xe2\x80\x99s just for the sole purpose to demonstrate that the government is trying to do something, the appearance of action, because he knows Americans are frustrated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that everything he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, including writing this letter in response to an openness by the Speaker of the House to look at doing something that in the past has been opposed --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But his position was already well known.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, his position is well known, but why he\xe2\x80\x99s -- he continues to press for taking this action.\xc2\xa0 And I think looking at what the Speaker said last night, seems to me, taking his words -- taking his words at face value, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an openness expressed there to address this issue.\xc2\xa0 And that is why he wrote the letter.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing symbolic about it.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s asking for immediate action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd everything that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing on this issue has been designed to push forward on an energy policy, to ensure through the actions -- in terms of the administration, the Attorney General has announced actions towards ensuring that fraud and manipulation is not occurring in the oil markets and that consumers are not being affected by that.\xc2\xa0 These are concrete measures.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t defeat the fact that there are -- this is a situation where it is very hard, that there is no single silver bullet that\xe2\x80\x99s going to suddenly bring us back to $2.50 gas.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a reality.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need a serious long-term energy policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But while you say these measures are not done with politics as the motive or people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to the gas station thinking about who they\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote for, I mean, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think this has nothing to do with how Americans view him and his handling of the economy, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think when I\xe2\x80\x99ve had questions about -- and tried to answer them candidly about why polls have been moving in whatever direction they\xe2\x80\x99re moving, in terms of people\xe2\x80\x99s optimism or right track/wrong track, that kind of stuff, I mean, we do attribute a lot of that to the economic anxiety caused by high gas prices.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the question earlier was about impact on an election that\xe2\x80\x99s 18 months away.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an eternity in our minds, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not what\xe2\x80\x99s driving our actions today by any means. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd as others have pointed out, I mean, taking measures that support a long-term energy policy that can ensure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t go through this in the same in the future is a far-sighted, not a short-sighted approach to this problem.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s my answer.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Laura.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just picking up from there, so given that the gas prices are largely out of your control -- certainly in the short run -- how worried is the White House that this is going to remain a problem through the next year and a half?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- you keep -- you guys -- we have big -- this is not a -- like a time of sort of slow news, right, with small issues on the table.\xc2\xa0 It just seems a little unnecessary to me to start writing stories about these major challenges facing us in terms of an election that\xe2\x80\x99s 18 months off.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at it.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that\xe2\x80\x99s not how we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I just think these issues are important in and of -- by themselves.\xc2\xa0 Americans are not thinking about this in terms of elections.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about the impact on their family budgets in terms -- through a lens of politics.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re wondering how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet their budgets, how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay the bills, and what -- to the extent they\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about Washington, they\xe2\x80\x99re wondering what Washington is going to do to help them deal with this.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things Washington did do, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve pointed out, is we worked with Republicans and passed a tax cut that includes a payroll tax holiday, that has put more money in Americans\xe2\x80\x99 pockets every week, which has cushioned the blow that these high energy prices have delivered.\xc2\xa0 And then all the measure that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now, that\xe2\x80\x99s the response we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about how does this affect an election that\xe2\x80\x99s an eternity away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that you have said that there\xe2\x80\x99s no real short-term impact from these -- closing these loopholes, is this primarily a proposal to address gas prices, or primarily a deficit-control proposal?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President called for in his letter was that this money be used to invest in -- let me get the exact language.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But putting aside how the money is used -- I understand you want to use the money for this -- but those are really two separate proposals that you\xe2\x80\x99re putting together.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re proposing to raise taxes on gas companies, which you support in it of itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re proposing to eliminate subsidies that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing at the bottom line.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- basically give -- for you and me and everybody in this room who pays taxes --and I\xe2\x80\x99m counting on the fact that most of you do -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re paying these major oil companies, you\xe2\x80\x99re paying them, and yet this week they\xe2\x80\x99re going to report billions and billions of dollars in profits -- $100 million a day by one measure.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s great.\xc2\xa0 We are for companies making a profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But -- I get it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do not think that you need to subsidize that profit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So is the reason to do that, the reason to close these unwarranted loopholes, as you say, is the reason to control gas prices or is the reason to address the deficit, primarily?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The reason is to -- we live in a time of limited resources, where we have to tighten our belts, and we need that -- here\xe2\x80\x99s a way to look at it, okay?\xc2\xa0 In the House Republican budget proposal, those $4 billion a year in subsidies are maintained.\xc2\xa0 In order to pay for and maintain those subsidies, and in order to provide the other tax cuts for wealthy Americans that are contained in that proposal, and still somehow reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, you have to slash and eliminate Medicare as we know it, you have to basically eliminate Medicare -- Medicaid as we know it, and you have to cut investment in clean energy by 70 percent.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that is so shortsighted, in our view, at a time when we see the consequences of not having a long-term energy policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHad previous Presidents and Congresses addressed this issue five, 10, 15 years ago, in a farsighted way, we would not be suffering in the way that we are now from high gas prices.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd so this is action that the President wants to take and Congress should take that will have benefits not tomorrow necessarily but for future -- for America in the future, for future generations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s a deficit proposal.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I mean, just based on what you just said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s part of -- I think I addressed this question earlier when I was asked, is it an immediate action or is it within the context?\xc2\xa0 And the answer is both.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we have obviously proposed it, the President has proposed it, within the context of one-year budget proposals and also in his long-term deficit reduction plan -- because your budget proposals are about your priorities, right?\xc2\xa0 And they are -- he takes a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that, on balance, especially at a time when oil prices are what they are and oil companies are making the kind of profits they are, that we cannot as a nation afford to subsidize those companies to the tune of $4 billion a year.\xc2\xa0 Because that money needs -- the needs for that money in terms of deficit reduction and investments in clean energy are far higher priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMr. Knoller, do you have a question for me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do.\xc2\xa0 How can you ask us not to look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies through a political prism when he himself is doing six fundraisers last week, three more tomorrow, going to be on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on Oprah?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, are you saying --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything viewed through a political prism?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the nature of our system?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We may view -- you can view it through a political prism.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you can -- the President is obviously running for reelection.\xc2\xa0 We are 18 months from that election.\xc2\xa0 The fact that he, as every candidate does, has political events does not mean -- those are the political events -- does not mean that every action he takes here has to do with the election.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.\xc2\xa0 And I dare say it\xe2\x80\x99s never been the case for any incumbent President 18 months out of -- out from an election.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, is that being here in the White House requires you to make a lot of decisions and a lot of choices that are a good policy that are often not necessarily good politics.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what you buy into when you run for office and you get elected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- by that line of thinking, that the moment you win election you\xe2\x80\x99re running for reelection -- and I know that\xe2\x80\x99s how some folks here look at it and, heck, I probably did and plead guilty to it when I was a reporter.\xc2\xa0 But then when the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What changed you?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was -- I saw the light.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 So when the President decided against every poll, against every political pundit, virtually, that it was the right thing to do to save the American auto industry, was he -- Laura, was he thinking about his election prospects?\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re telling us that just like that he was not thinking about election prospects with this letter today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that he -- look, you all have said that this is not an instant remedy to gas prices.\xc2\xa0 He thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do, and he saw an opening here, expressed by the Speaker of the House, to get something done that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker knows the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t breaking news.\xc2\xa0 I mean --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what\xe2\x80\x99s breaking news is his openness.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he put it in the budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Speaker closed the opening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but the Speaker knows that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys judge that for yourselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that political?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, do I -- look at the -- look, we can debate this.\xc2\xa0 This is not a chat show or talk show.\xc2\xa0 But the point is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It might make it more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the President heard what the Speaker said and believes that -- he agrees that we should look at this, we needed to do this.\xc2\xa0 And I think that in the face of the circumstances we\xe2\x80\x99re in, and the fact that the companies that are getting these subsidies -- $4 billion of our limited taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 dollars every year -- are this week reporting enormous profits, and good for them, certainly means -- and his -- I think, reinforces the argument he\xe2\x80\x99s been making that we do not need to, as American taxpayers, to subsidize this industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could he have called Boehner and been less showy about it, and then people wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think it was politically motivated?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, he wrote a letter -- look, he wants immediate action.\xc2\xa0 He wrote a letter saying that we should get this done now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear a whole lot of confidence from you guys that the oil companies either -- your predecessor will necessarily do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 What makes you think they won\xe2\x80\x99t just pass -- if you take away this tax cut -- won\xe2\x80\x99t just pass it on short term to consumers with higher tax prices?\xc2\xa0 Are you at all concerned about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, what I know is that gas prices are very, very high, no question.\xc2\xa0 So the idea that with these subsidies oil companies are artificially depressing gas prices, tell that -- go out to a gas station in Virginia or Maryland and tell that to somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s paying the price.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not credible, because they\xe2\x80\x99re also --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No concerns from you guys that the oil companies are going to pass this through?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s credible --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that on balance overwhelmingly the right thing to do is eliminate these subsidies and -- because the American taxpayer should not be subsidizing companies that don\xe2\x80\x99t need subsidies by any stretch of the imagination.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they won\xe2\x80\x99t pass it on, do you?\xc2\xa0 Is there any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is on balance, knowing what we know and looking -- and analyzing what we know, that this is overwhelmingly the right thing to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even though prices may go up in the short term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve just addressed it.\xc2\xa0 Based on what we know --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re passing the higher price of oil onto consumers now.\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they pass a higher tax burden onto consumers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, based on what we know -- you have companies making billions of dollars in profit, $100 million a day in profit -- that\xe2\x80\x99s great, okay?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xc2\xa0 We should not be taxed.\xc2\xa0 We -- the American taxpayers should not be subsidizing that profit, okay?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just in and of itself, we believe, the right policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe Speaker of the House expressed an interest in that as well last night.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re saying.\xc2\xa0 The President wrote a letter following up on the expressed interest by the Speaker of the House to openness to a policy position that the President has held for a number of years now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just shift back to something on tomorrow, just the Fed, transparency.\xc2\xa0 The White House has talked a lot about transparency; we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some at the Fed.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the posture or the plan for tomorrow when Bernanke has his first press conference?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys going to be monitoring, watching?\xc2\xa0 Will the President be watching?\xc2\xa0 Is it must-see TV?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked what people\xe2\x80\x99s plans are in terms of tuning in.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything to say about a plan in reaction to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, Bernanke could weigh in on the debt ceiling, the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Are you at all concerned that he may alter the trajectory of the debate at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll all obviously tune in, I guess, or I will if I\xe2\x80\x99m in my office.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Panama president is going to be here later this week.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the President that the Panama, Colombia, and Korean trade deals are going to get done --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We feel very good about the progress that has been made on the Colombian trade agreement, the Panamanian trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement on an action plan outlining steps that the Colombian government needs to take on labor issues, and that\xe2\x80\x99s moving.\xc2\xa0 We have an agreement with Panama.\xc2\xa0 We have long had an agreement with Korea.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we need to -- the Congress needs to move on these because they are job creators here in America.\xc2\xa0 And they -- and what the President demonstrated in the way he negotiated the deal with Korea was that he does not believe trade deals are inherently the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 They have to have provisions in them that protect American workers.\xc2\xa0 He was willing to walk away from a deal and, by doing so, made sure that Americans got a better deal out of the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we feel very strongly that we should be able to move on these trade agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tPerry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House still considering the proposal from last week about requiring federal contractors to disclose their political contributions?\xc2\xa0 And can you talk about where that is in the process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere different than it was last week, which was a draft of an executive order that -- and drafts change.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChristi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a logistical question about the rest of this week.\xc2\xa0 When the President goes to Chicago on Wednesday, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to tape an episode with Oprah -- a show you may not have seen but heard of.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it.\xc2\xa0 Now, is any of that going to be seen by the pool or open to us publicly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what our plan is for that.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, if you were doing an interview with the President -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying here -- what if you were doing an exclusive interview with the President and the First Lady, would we open it to the rest -- to the pool?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Others say yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind that, in the interest of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on what the logistics for that are.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to know.\xc2\xa0 I mean, at the moment, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 At the moment I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we are opening somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s interview to the press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we won\xe2\x80\x99t see or hear from the President at all --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure about that.\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also on -- what about the trip to Cape Canaveral?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see the President or hear from him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make in terms of press availabilities, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ll see him, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He won\xe2\x80\x99t make remarks or anything like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement on that yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAbby.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In another interview that Speaker Boehner did on Monday, he indicated that there actually might not be a vote on the debt ceiling if, he says, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get more serious about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 In the past you guys have said that everyone is on the same page on this, that congressional leaders agree that the debt ceiling vote needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 If Speaker Boehner is serious, as it seems like he is, what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that and where does that leave the conversation that you guys are having on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that our reaction to that is sort of our reaction in general to suggestions emanating from Congress that we should somehow hold hostage a vote on raising the debt ceiling to some other action.\xc2\xa0 Our reaction is that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible, terrible idea, because it would so imperil the American economy, it would drive up interest rates, could in fact tank the global economy.\xc2\xa0 I just think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad approach, and the President does, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd other statements that the Speaker has made and other statements that other Republican and Democratic leaders have made lead us to believe that broadly speaking we all -- we, the White House and the leaders of Congress, understand the truth here, which is that it is -- would be foolhardy to play chicken with the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 It is simply too risky, too risky to do.\xc2\xa0 So we -- that\xe2\x80\x99s our approach, and we certainly hope that any leader who expressed otherwise would reevaluate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as the debt ceiling is concerned, but also just the budget generally, this week the President is doing a lot of events but none of them seem to be geared at talking to the American people about this issue in the same way that he did last week and the week before that.\xc2\xa0 Why is that, and how -- what\xe2\x80\x99s he going to do going forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- the President -- obviously, there are a lot of issues on his plate, Laura, and the -- that he has to deal with.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have to contend with a number of issues at one time.\xc2\xa0 But he will continue to speak about the need for long-term deficit reduction, the need to get our fiscal house in order, the need to take a balanced approach that allows our economy to continue to grow and our economy to continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that -- I mean, last week was a somewhat unique week in that we had three almost consecutive town hall meetings where he could address those issues, as well as others that were brought up by questioners.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look for opportunities for him to speak to that issue because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important, and obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re in a process where, beginning next week, this will begin to be taken up by negotiators on Capitol Hill, or rather negotiators from Capitol Hill, and led by the Vice President in what we hope is a serious and substantive and productive way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A large part of this briefing has been about protecting consumers\xe2\x80\x99 pocketbooks, American consumers\xe2\x80\x99 pocketbooks.\xc2\xa0 But Tavis Smiley is asking, if the President is looking at now -- not just looking at a targeted approach but a universal approach now -- excuse me, not a universal approach but a targeted approach on helping those who are the least of these, those who have higher unemployment rates than the national average, and maybe not just the black community, but also more so looking at the poverty agenda, looking at those universally in a targeted way -- whites, blacks, Hispanics -- are you looking more at targeting in on those who are having a harder time economically now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I would say that one point that the President has made clear as he\xe2\x80\x99s addressed the issues that Abby just raised -- in terms of our debt, our deficits, how we spend our money, what our budget priorities are -- is that we should not -- reducing the deficit is a significant and high priority.\xc2\xa0 Getting our fiscal house in order is a significant and high priority.\xc2\xa0 How we get there is important, because it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And one reason why it has to be a balanced approach is that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be, as some have suggested, that we reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over 10 to 12 years solely by burdening seniors, middle-class Americans and impoverished or disabled Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just what he -- he does not believe that\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible, balanced approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo when he talks about the need to protect Medicare and maintain the commitment that Medicare provides, to protect the commitment that Medicaid provides, to protect those who are disabled or in nursing homes, or do not have means to get by without the security that Medicare, for example, provides, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about, because we -- it would not be -- while we have priorities, there is a way to do this in a balanced way that shares the responsibility so that we all can share in the prosperity.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that cut and dry, because once you do reduce the deficit and you make these budget cuts, you will be cutting jobs and programs that affect people\xe2\x80\x99s pocketbooks.\xc2\xa0 So again, the question is, will there be more sort of a targeted approach to help those who are at the bottom rung?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me -- what I would say is, again, go back to the CR debate, the budget fiscal year 2011 debate, where the President took a very targeted approach in the tough choices he was willing to make, sometimes in programs that he supported but did not consider absolute priorities in these times of fiscal constraints, and then, at the same time, insisted that we protect investments in other areas -- Head Start, for example -- and protect other programs that are vital, he thinks, to making sure that we continue to grow and we protect Americans who need protecting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the last thing from -- just these quotes from Mr. Smiley.\xc2\xa0 He said that when Wall Street asked for bailout, the government gave them bailout.\xc2\xa0 When the auto industry asked for a bailout, they were given a bailout.\xc2\xa0 But when black people are crying because of unemployment, where are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been focused, as you know -- there is no -- there has been no greater focus that this President has had since he took office than on the cascading unemployment that greeted him when he was sworn in and the 8 million jobs that were lost -- lost by this recession that he inherited.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Recovery Act was about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the -- don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, April, the auto company bailout that I mentioned earlier and that you mentioned that was unpopular at the time, one of -- the primary reasons to save the auto industry in this country was the 1 million jobs attached to it, working American men and women who have their jobs today because this President and this Congress took action, and not out of charity, but -- that compelled the auto companies involved to reorient themselves.\xc2\xa0 And they are now making profits.\xc2\xa0 They are now -- the American auto industry is now in a very preeminent position globally.\xc2\xa0 We had great news from Ford today, in terms of its numbers.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had them for GM and Chrysler.\xc2\xa0 So this is -- everything he\xe2\x80\x99s done in response to this great recession has been with jobs in mind.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple on Syria.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with the Turkish leader yesterday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about what you see Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing role as being?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be -- has he agreed to -- it sounded from the readout like he kind of essentially agreed with the U.S. position.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- am I overreaching?\xc2\xa0 Is his role going to be to advocate the U.S. position to the Syrian leader on an ongoing basis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get beyond the readout.\xc2\xa0 You can certainly address some questions about that to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Turkey is an important ally.\xc2\xa0 The U.S.-Turkish relationship is an important relationship.\xc2\xa0 The President has a very strong relationship with President [***Prime Minister] Erdogan.\xc2\xa0 But beyond the details provided in the readout, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to elaborate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In his meeting with the UAE leader today, is Syria specifically -- Syria is part of those conversations or is it mostly Libya?\xc2\xa0 And is Iran part of those conversations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the region is the focus of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Regional security in general would probably be the principal focus.\xc2\xa0 So that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be limited to one country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, you were talking earlier about -- and it was in the context of the economy -- about how not everything the President does is political, and sometimes he has to advocate a position that will probably hurt him politically.\xc2\xa0 With the unfolding of the Arab Spring over the last couple of months, do you think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in that is something that is either neutral or even negative for him domestically because people want to think about the economy and gas prices?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously he has to weigh in.\xc2\xa0 He has to get involved.\xc2\xa0 He has to make decisions.\xc2\xa0 Is that an example of the sort of thing that may be a drag domestically, but something that\xe2\x80\x99s important in --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the political analysis to others.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s what I said earlier.\xc2\xa0 This is what you get when you run for and win this office is a host of difficult problems.\xc2\xa0 And they can be domestic problems or international challenges, and your job is to handle them and take policy positions and take actions based on what you think is best for the United States of America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn international affairs, that means what\xe2\x80\x99s -- what actions can you take that ensures the safety of Americans, ensures that American national security interests are protected internationally, and that in the case of the Arab Spring, that ensures -- gives the best possible chance that the outcome of this upheaval will be positive for the peoples of the region and for the United States of America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
