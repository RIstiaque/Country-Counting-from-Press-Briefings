EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to Columbus, Ohio, with us today, ladies.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And let me just read to you -- that\'s the background on the event we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but make a couple of announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will attend an event in the Washington, D.C. area and sign the America Invents Act.\xc2\xa0 The America Invents Act was passed with the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong leadership after nearly a decade of effort to reform our outdated patent laws.\xc2\xa0 It also reflects strong bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And Congress is working together on behalf of American innovation -- that might be a run-on sentence, for which I apologize.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, President Obama will announce new steps the administration is taking that will help convert the ideas from America\xe2\x80\x99s universities and research labs into new products, expanding our economy and creating new jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso the Vice President tomorrow will convene the first Cabinet\xe2\x80\x99s waste-cutting meeting, as part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s campaign to cut waste.\xc2\xa0 At the meeting, Secretary Solis and Sebelius will announce new initiatives to fight waste and fraud, and the Vice President will call on each Cabinet Secretary to undertake additional efforts to target unnecessary, wasteful and inefficient federal spending.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there been a White House statement on the attacks in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the White House has put out a statement.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton has addressed it.\xc2\xa0 I believe the Pentagon has addressed it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to say that, as far as we know, there are no U.S. casualties at this point.\xc2\xa0 There are some Afghan wounded.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to make clear that this will in no way deter our commitment to the mission, which is to provide for security in the country, as we work to transition a security lead to the Afghan national security forces.\xc2\xa0 That mission has had important success and we continue on it as we move towards drawing down surge forces, and further training up and increasing the capacity of the Afghan national security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the jobs package, Eric Cantor says that the Republicans will probably split off the tax portion.\xc2\xa0 How is the White House planning to navigate that?\xc2\xa0 What does it do to the effectiveness of the jobs package?\xc2\xa0 And as a third point, what assurances do you have that even Democrats like Mary Landrieu or Chuck Schumer would sign to some of the hedge fund stuff?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we believe that all the measures in the jobs act -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t just believe, we know it -- are the kinds of measures that have had bipartisan support in the past.\xc2\xa0 I can provide you, if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already, ample evidence of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo your question about the majority leader, the President submitted the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 It is a package of proposals, which outside economists believes would, if enacted in full, have a significant impact on economic growth and job creation in America -- significant.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that Congress should act on the American Jobs Act right away.\xc2\xa0 We believe that if Congress were to send a portion of the American Jobs Act, the President would, of course, not veto it.\xc2\xa0 He would sign it, and then he would return to press the Congress to get the rest of the job done -- because there is simply an urgent need in this country to grow the economy and put Americans back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tCongress will have a lot of explaining to do if, come the end of the year, they have done nothing to address Americans\xe2\x80\x99 number-one priority, which is the need for the economy to get going and the need to put Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0 They will still have a significant amount to explain if they only took some of the measures they could have taken, but not all of the ones.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it would have any positive effect on the economy even if not as much as you wanted?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think below a certain threshold, no bump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which specific provisions you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Each of them, economists I think have broken out and measured in terms of what their potential economic impact would be.\xc2\xa0 So we think all of the measures are good.\xc2\xa0 But if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, if Congress sent us the portion that would ensure that teachers went back to work, yes, the President would sign it.\xc2\xa0 And then he would press for the other provisions.\xc2\xa0 If they sent us the payroll tax cut, we would sign it, and press for the other provisions.\xc2\xa0 Because they are all vital, they\xe2\x80\x99ve all enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you worried that by saying that you guys are willing to sign stuff if they pick off --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve done this a long time in Washington; you know how Congress works.\xc2\xa0 Bills get submitted to Congress, and Congress then obviously has the authority to act on them.\xc2\xa0 Our preference is for Congress -- because of the urgent need -- to take up the American Jobs Act, as the Senate is doing, and we hope the House will as well, and pass it in its entirety, unchanged, if you will.\xc2\xa0 But we understand how Congress works.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Congress moving quickly, not because we tell them to or the President tells them to, but because the American people are demanding that they act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to try to pay for this package with tax hikes that Republicans have already rejected, and Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman said yesterday that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this was happening in a spirit of bipartisanship?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that we live in a time where we have to make choices.\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans are saying that we can\xe2\x80\x99t put teachers back to work so that we -- because we insist that oil and gas companies maintain special preferences in the tax code that other industries don\xe2\x80\x99t have, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible argument.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people will think it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible argument, and it just won\xe2\x80\x99t hold.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s true as you go through those provisions -- I mean, as you go through the American Jobs Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo be specific about the pay-fors -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a briefing on this -- we put forward some discreet measures, revenue measures, that will pay for all the provisions in the American Jobs Act in their entirety, if the American Jobs Act were to pass in its entirety right away.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, there was a link between those provisions and\xc2\xa0 -- the pay-for provisions and what will be in the President\xe2\x80\x99s broader proposal for long-term deficit and debt reductions.\xc2\xa0 They will be in that.\xc2\xa0 So the committee obviously could -- if the committee decided -- super committee decided to find other offsets, it would render the pay-fors in the American Jobs act void, because it would be paid for in an alternative measure.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of having to pay -- having the measures that we have in there to pay for it is that we want Congress to act now.\xc2\xa0 If Congress passes the American Jobs Act, it\xe2\x80\x99s a guaranteed pay-for, as is.</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that sounds complicated, but it\xe2\x80\x99s basically ensuring that whether -- however Congress acts, the provisions the President put forward in the Jobs Act will be paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why propose tax increases that won\xe2\x80\x99t pass and that you know won\xe2\x80\x99t pass?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just political?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 As I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, when they say things like that, that it won\xe2\x80\x99t fly, that the Speaker of the House said on the House floor that he put revenues on the table as part of the negotiations with the President.\xc2\xa0 There is ample evidence that I can cite to you of Republican members of Congress saying, we need to close some of these loopholes -- supporting, for example, payroll tax cuts -- payroll tax cut for employees and employers, supporting all the provisions in the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf the argument is, should we eliminate tax preferences and loopholes and exceptions in order to pay for these things, we believe firmly that the American people overwhelmingly support that position, which is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the argument we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be making, the President is going to be making everywhere he goes, week after week after week here, including today in Columbus, Ohio.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the situation in Europe?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if Secretary Geithner is going to the eurozone financial ministers meeting in Poland with a certain goal, or a mission to accomplish there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, I think he was just at the G7 with his counterparts.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary is in constant communication both at a distance and in person with his counterparts in Europe. And there was no specific goal to this meeting as I understand it, but simply part of his regular communication, consultation and meetings with his European counterparts as Europe deals with a difficult situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, out of curiosity, why did you guys decide to do this first visit to a school that\'s been newly renovated rather than one that\'s in need of renovation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is to demonstrate the benefit that comes from renovating, modernizing, rebuilding schools.\xc2\xa0 It has a direct impact not only on the people who were hired to do the work but on the kids in the school, on those who teach there and work there.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s an example of what we need to do around the country.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put that important provision in the American Jobs Act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President see as the greater need -- that schools are crumbling, or -- and are unsafe environments, or that they don\'t have Internet access?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s all important, because, obviously, it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable if kids are trying to learn in a school that\'s crumbling, or in some way unsafe, or needs serious maintenance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also vitally important for the future of this country and our ability to compete globally that we have kids who are learning about science and technology as they go through the school system and head to university.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any more info on the patent signing on Friday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I read you is all I have.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any update on the Palestinian-Saudi-U.N. -- talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no update on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of unsafe, we\xe2\x80\x99re landing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone else aboard on the trip that we didn\'t see?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Melody Barnes is here also -- I think she was on the plane ahead of us --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lawmakers, advocacy folks, anything like that?\xc2\xa0 Is Arne Duncan on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is.\xc2\xa0 He was on Marine One with us, yes.\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:06 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
