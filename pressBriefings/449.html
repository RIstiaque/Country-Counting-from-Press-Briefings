Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:50 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see everybody is being so chipper.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure it\'s because it\'s a Thursday that feels like a Friday, right?\xc2\xa0 That\'s good.</p>\n<p>Before we get started I just wanted to do a brief announcement at the top.\xc2\xa0 Both yesterday and today, the President was briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor, Lisa Monaco, on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prepare for the storm and ongoing coordination with state, local and tribal partners.\xc2\xa0 The storm I\'m referring to, of course, is Hurricane Arthur.</p>\n<p>The President directed his team to ensure that state and local officials in the storm\xe2\x80\x99s path have all the support and resources they need to prepare for and respond to any potential impacts.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to receive updates as necessary through the weekend.</p>\n<p>I also wanted to point out that FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate spoke with North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory and Emergency Management Director Michael Sprayberry about preparedness efforts and to ensure that that state has no unmet needs.\xc2\xa0 As part of our administration\xe2\x80\x99s forward-leaning approach to preparing for and responding to disasters, FEMA has deployed a special coordination team to North Carolina and prepositioned staff in North Carolina and South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s Emergency Operation Centers to work closely and ensure that we\'re closely integrated with state and local teams.</p>\n<p>So that\'s one way in which some administration officials are preparing for the weekend.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim, why don\'t you go ahead and get us started today?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the jobs report today.\xc2\xa0 The President has argued that Republicans have blocked his legislative policies; Republicans claim Democrats are blocking theirs.\xc2\xa0 Given that both sides essentially acknowledge that there has been no progress legislatively, can the President truly take credit for these positive job numbers?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just start by saying that the people who deserve the most credit for the strong recovery of the American economy are the American people, including American entrepreneurs and American workers.\xc2\xa0 It is through their grit and determination that we have recovered so strongly from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>But they have been aided by some of the policies that this President put in place at the very beginning of his presidency. From the Recovery Act to the politically courageous decision that the President made to rescue the auto industry, to a range of other reforms, some of which we put in place with congressional support and some of which have required independent action from the President, have laid the foundation that has been helpful to the private sector as they have led the recovery of the American economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s over five, six years ago.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said throughout this recovery, actually in much darker times, we talked about the fact that the kind of crisis that was created didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur overnight, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caused by conditions overnight, and our recovery was not going to happen overnight.\xc2\xa0 These are longer-term trends that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And because of the critically important decisions that this President made over the course of his presidency, again, it put in place a foundation that has allowed the private sector to lead our economic recovery.</p>\n<p>The President is very pleased with the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 There is some history associated with today\xe2\x80\x99s statistics. In the first six months of this year, 1.4 million private sector jobs were created.\xc2\xa0 That is more jobs that have been created in the first six months of any year since 1999.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last five consecutive months more than 200,000 jobs have been created.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first that that\xe2\x80\x99s happened since the end of 1999.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve created now 9.7 million private sector jobs over the last 52 months.\xc2\xa0 And the unemployment rate has actually declined more quickly when you consider year-over-year numbers than at any point in the last three decades.</p>\n<p>So we have made tremendous progress, and the numbers bear that out.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s also important is the President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we can do to ensure the middle-class families all across the country are enjoying the benefits of what seems to be a strengthening recovery.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why this President is so focused on putting in place the kinds of policies that will expand economic opportunity for the middle class so that the benefits of this recovery don\xe2\x80\x99t just float to the top, but actually float to families in the middle class as well -- because the President believes that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a sustainable growing economy that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to grow this economy from the middle out.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 And these strong numbers that we saw in today\xe2\x80\x99s report only give the President a greater sense of urgency to making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re capitalizing on this momentum and making sure that middle-class families across the country are benefitting from this recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about something the President said to Kai Ryssdal regarding the financial sector.\xc2\xa0 He said that he believes there\xe2\x80\x99s still room for reforms.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what he had in mind since he also said that he believes that taxpayers are protected under the Dodd-Frank bill, a position that not everybody even in his own party agrees with.\xc2\xa0 But he was talking about risk-taking and how to control risk-taking to protect I believe other investors, and I wondered whether he\xe2\x80\x99s discussed some of those potential proposals with anybody.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Wall Street reform legislation that passed in the first year and a half or so of this President\xe2\x80\x99s administration are another good example of policies that are put in place that have stabilized the financial system, ensured that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for bailing out big banks that make risky bets that go bad.\xc2\xa0 And that stability has also contributed significantly to our economic recovery, has allowed the financial markets to recover.\xc2\xa0 And the success of those financial markets has an important role in terms of the benefits that are enjoyed by our broader economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President alluded to this in the interview -- that strong and dynamic financial markets are part of what makes the American economy the envy of the world.\xc2\xa0 After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s performing financial markets that ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s capital available to entrepreneurs who want to start and grow their business.\xc2\xa0 Small businesses are an important contributor to job growth in this country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the efficient functioning of our capital markets that ensures that middle-class families across the country will be able to go out and get a mortgage at an affordable rate that will allow them to purchase a home.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s an important role for our own financial markets to play in the strength of our broader economy, but also in terms of making sure that our economy\xe2\x80\x99s strength benefits middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering the economic policymaking decisions of this administration for five and a half years now, so you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with the idea that the President and his team, since the President\xe2\x80\x99s very first day in office, have been focused on the financial markets and making sure that we both are stabilizing those financial markets through a regulatory regime that prevents banks from making the kinds of risky bets that hurt our economy so badly in 2007 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also concerned about making sure that middle-class families have an advocate and a voice in the policymaking process here in Washington, D.C. when it comes to these kinds of financial regulations; that too often, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past that special interests, big banks, Wall Street financial firms have been able to dictate a regulatory regime that, again, led to a system that incentivized big banks and other large financial institutions to make the kinds of bets that ultimately were bad for our economy.</p>\n<p>In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s interview yesterday, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t referring to any specific regulation or law that he had in mind, but rather the need to continue to vigilantly monitor financial markets to assess risks that may be emerging and to ensure that the necessary regulatory protections are in place, again, to ensure the stability of the financial markets, but also to make sure that somebody is looking out for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not -- he just sort of threw these things out there?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not looking for legislation or any sort of executive action, regulations, nothing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific thing that the President had in mind.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not referring to some specific plan.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this is something that the President and senior members of his economic team are talking about every day as they monitor the financial markets and assess the risk that\xe2\x80\x99s embedded there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There obviously is an important role to play -- let me say it this way -- there is also obviously an important role for those agencies to play as they continue to implement Wall Street reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also an important role to play for these independent regulatory agencies; that the Fed and others who are responsible for monitoring this risk and putting in place rules that will ensure, again, that taxpayers aren\xe2\x80\x99t left holding the bag when it comes to bailing out a big business who\xe2\x80\x99s placed a bunch of risky bets.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the economy -- what do you say to the individual who can\xe2\x80\x99t find a job and has stopped looking?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things to them.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President is fighting for you.\xc2\xa0 What you have is you have a President who is fighting to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding economic opportunity to those who are looking hard for a job, those who are trying to get the kind of job training that will ensure that they\'re competitive when they go out and look for a job.\xc2\xa0 After all, having those kinds of job training programs in place isn\xe2\x80\x99t just good for those who are working hard to try and find a job, it\xe2\x80\x99s also good for those businesses that are looking for workers to fulfill specific functions that will ensure the success of their business.</p>\n<p>So those people should understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s a President here in Washington, D.C. that, despite all of the partisan sniping that so often gets filtered down to them, that behind the scenes there is a President who is -- who wakes up every morning, at the top of his list is thinking about and implementing measures that will be in the best interests of middle-class families who are trying to succeed, who are trying to live out the American Dream.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about recovery in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 We see the first storm of the season possibly causing a lot of damage.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned about the effect that that could have on all these local economies up the coast, the most densely populated part of the country, as well as the pressure that it could put on the insurance industry and infrastructure?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our primary concern right now, Michelle, is making sure that citizens who are in the path of the storm are taking the necessary precautions to prepare for the storm before it hits.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important for citizens to understand that they should be following closely the instructions that are given to them by local and state officials who are responsible for issuing evacuation orders and things of that kind; that preparing for the storm in advance and listening to weather reports and following the instructions of state and local officials is what\xe2\x80\x99s most important.</p>\n<p>In terms of the broader impact, we also want to make sure that we are -- that FEMA is doing everything that they can to support state and local efforts, that when it comes time to recover and, if necessary, rebuild from this storm, that we can do so quickly and efficiently.\xc2\xa0 I think FEMA under this President has a remarkably strong track record when it comes to assisting states and local communities in rebuilding after natural disasters.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now.</p>\n<p>In terms of the longer-term economic consequences of a storm like this, I\xe2\x80\x99d hesitate to make any predictions -- either meteorological or financial -- about what the potential impact is of this storm.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching carefully.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say many times, that when there are local communities who are affected by difficult events like this or destructive events like this, that this administration and the American people will stand with those communities as they prepare to rebuild.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ready to see this hearing down in Texas today on the immigration situation.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Texas -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of anger down there and you hear a lot of anger kind of growing among those communities as well as partially in Congress concerning a lot -- to much of the extent the expense that it\xe2\x80\x99s costing the taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 How would the White House address that anger that kind of sparks up when these events now are happening?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would address that in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President is committed to enforcing the law, and enforcing the law means that when there are apprehensions that are made at the border, particularly of children or adults who are traveling with children, we need to make sure that the basic humanitarian needs of those individuals are provided for.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has asked for additional resources from Congress to open up detention facilities across the country where these individuals can be housed in humane conditions.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a couple of weeks ago, are considering alternatives to detention -- ankle bracelets and other things -- that would, again, in a humane way allow this administration to continue to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is some of the -- one of the reasons that we are asking for additional resources is we would like to process these immigration cases more efficiently through the legal system.\xc2\xa0 So certainly those who are apprehended are entitled to due process and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be given that due process, but we also want to make sure that the system is functioning efficiently.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re finding right now is that there has been a spike in those individuals who have been apprehended at the border and so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for resources to bring to bear additional immigration judges, asylum officers and ICE lawyers to process these cases more quickly, and we\xe2\x80\x99re asking for Congress to give the Secretary of Homeland Security additional discretion as he enforces the law.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases, that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to mean after this due process has run its course that those who no longer -- or who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal basis for staying in the country will quickly be returned to their home country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration agree with the fact that the law works differently depending on what country these people are coming from?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is the law, that there are different interpretations related to that.\xc2\xa0 But what this administration is seeking to do is to make sure that we are rigorously following the law but also seeking greater authority for the Secretary of Homeland Security to use his discretion and, in some cases, more quickly and efficiently removing people who have gone through the due process of the immigration system and returning them to their home country.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around just a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 The Kurds in northern Iraq are about to change their status from semi-autonomous to autonomous.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind seeing that.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, as has been well documented, put that idea out in 2006 and 2008.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with letting the Kurds break away and form their own nation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to of the increased interest among the Kurds for some autonomy or at least a referendum that would allow them to vote for their autonomy.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that we continue to believe that Iraq is stronger if it\xe2\x80\x99s united.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States continues to support an Iraq that is democratic, pluralistic, and unified, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to urge all parties in Iraq to continue working together toward that objective.</p>\n<p>The best way for Iraq to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL is to unify the country in the face of that existential threat.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of all the citizens of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders is for them to come together, to put aside sectarian divisions, and focus on the best interests of the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Kurdish leaders will play a similarly constructive role in making that happen in the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re appealing to the national interest of Sunni and Shia leaders to do the same thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are the Kurds in a position, though, militarily and economically, to be far more stable now than what we\'re seeing from the government in Baghdad?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a difficult assessment for me to offer from here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, suffice it to say, again, it is our position that it\'s in the best interests of all of the citizens of Iraq for that country to come together to confront that threat.\xc2\xa0 That includes Kurds, Sunni, and Shia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'m not surprised to hear that there may be some speculation or some analysis from different quarters who might suggest that one group might be better off standing on its own.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s the policy of this administration and this country that, again, Iraq will better weather the threat that\'s posed by ISIL if that country unifies around the goal of defending that country against the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on that planned executive order barring LGBT discrimination among federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 LGBT advocates are pushing back against a request from some faith leaders -- to include a religious exemption in the measure.\xc2\xa0 When will we have more information about the content of this executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, as you know, the President has directed his team to prepare an executive order that would allow him to prohibit federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an executive order that\'s still be drafted, and so I wouldn\'t want to speculate about the contents of that order until it\'s been finalized.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you at least say at this point whether the Hobby Lobby decision requires the administration to include a religious exemption in that order?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'m not in the position to indicate to you at this point what measures will be included in the executive order because it\'s not been finalized yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are two executive orders now on the LGBT community.\xc2\xa0 The President announced a separate executive order that would bar discrimination against transgender federal employees.\xc2\xa0 Can we at least expect that both these executive orders will be on the same track for signing implementation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ll be signed at the same time.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer you any updates in terms of the timing of these executive orders that have been widely discussed now.\xc2\xa0 But as soon as we do have an update we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>Move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s see -- Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell us more about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s naturalization ceremony.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that previous Presidents have done, oftentimes on the 4th of July.\xc2\xa0 The President had the opportunity to talk about this in the Rose Garden earlier this week where he talked about how appropriate it was that there would be an opportunity for the Commander-in-Chief, the President of the United States, on Independence Day, to naturalize those individuals who are in this country legally who signed up to join the military to defend this country.\xc2\xa0 That is a pretty strong testament to the values that are held by those immigrants, and giving them the opportunity to be naturalized and to get their official U.S. citizenship on Independence Day I think is a pretty compelling story.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about those individuals who will be naturalized tomorrow, but I can tell you that the President is genuinely looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the border for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 You said the President has no plans to visit the border when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Texas next week.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what went into that decision?\xc2\xa0 Did he consider going?\xc2\xa0 And what message does the President believe he\xe2\x80\x99s sending by staying away from what he\xe2\x80\x99s calling a humanitarian crisis on the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, the first thing I would say is that senior officials in the last several weeks have spent a lot of time visiting the border to assess the conditions there.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Johnson; Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top immigration policy advisor here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The commandant of the Coast Guard and other senior officials from FEMA traveled to the border region on June 20th.\xc2\xa0 They had an opportunity to visit some CBP facilities and also visited Lackland Air Force Base where some of those who have been detained -- or some of those who were apprehended are being detained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secretary Johnson traveled to Nogales on June 25th, where, again, he reviewed some U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities to assess the situation on the ground there and assess the ability of CBP officials to process those who had been apprehended.\xc2\xa0 There was a more recent trip that, again, involved Secretary Johnson and this time Secretary Burwell, to south Texas on June 30th, where they took a guided tour of the child intake and care facilities, and participated in an interagency discussion at the Lackland shelter on lessons learned, challenges, and best practices for detaining these individuals.</p>\n<p>The CBP commissioner earlier this week traveled to McAllen, where he participated in a news conference and delivered a pretty clear message to families in Central America that sending their children -- putting their children in the hands of some of the criminal networks that have sprouted up to transport children to the southwest border is not a good idea.</p>\n<p>So the point of me reviewing all of that is to make clear to you and to your readers that senior administration officials have spent a lot of time on the border, because the President and other members of his senior team are concerned both about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there but also making sure that they have a very clear up-to-date assessment of what exactly is happening on a regular basis there and how the additional resources that have been devoted to that region are dealing with this surge and illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Texas, the President is going to, as you know, spend some time raising money for Democrats in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 The President is also looking forward to the opportunity to spending some time in Austin with a couple of folks who have written him letters.\xc2\xa0 This is similar to some of the events he participated in in Minnesota last week.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about how much he enjoyed having the opportunity to sit down with a working mother in Minnesota who had written him a letter about some of the challenges that her family faced, and the President is looking forward to having a similar opportunity when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Texas next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the status of the emergency supplemental, he said the he was going to -- you said you would have more details on that next week.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some pushback from refugee and immigration advocacy groups on the approach -- the new authorities that the President alerted Congress he would be asking for to expedite the removal of some of these kids.\xc2\xa0 Has that caused you all to reassess the approach there?\xc2\xa0 Are you still weighing exactly which authorities to ask Congress for?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that we have a good sense of what kinds of authorities that we would seek in terms of the greater discretion that could be employed by the Secretary of Homeland Security to deal with the recent surge in illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the southwest border.</p>\n<p>There are some challenges that are posed by the current law, this 2008 law, that requires that unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries be treated differently in the system than children from Canada or Mexico.\xc2\xa0 What that greater authority would do is it would ensure that as these cases are being processed through the regular due process channels that exist in our immigration courts, that they can be resolved more promptly, and if it is determined through that due process legal proceeding that the individual does not have a legitimate claim to remain in the country, that the Secretary can exercise the discretion to promptly repatriate that person.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s important for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair way to deal with people in the immigration system rather than having them sort of languish in that system for a long time. The second thing is it sends a clear and unmistakable signal to parents who might be considering putting their children in the hands of a stranger -- in some cases a criminal -- to transport them to the southwest border with the expectation that if they get to the border that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be allowed to remain in the country.\xc2\xa0 That is simply not the case.\xc2\xa0 And that is further demonstrated by the exercise of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to promptly deal with some of these cases.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Despite the fact that the unaccompanied minors who are coming across and the minors who are coming across with their mothers are not eligible for DACA, there are those in the Republican Party who are calling upon the President to rescind DACA as a message.\xc2\xa0 Would that work?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration believe if the President said, all right, no more DACA, that the flow would stop?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s farfetched to think that that that would be a viable solution.\xc2\xa0 What we know right now, Jim, is that there are criminal networks in Central America that are engaged in a coordinated misinformation campaign and luring people who are in increasingly desperate situations to pay them large sums of money to transport them or their children to the southwest border of the United States with the expectation that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcomed into the United States even though they\xe2\x80\x99re not following the legal immigration procedures.</p>\n<p>That is what we\xe2\x80\x99re up against right now.\xc2\xa0 And that is why you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President, other senior administration officials articulate very clearly what the law is and the fact that the law will continue to be rigorously enforced.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ll also do is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to also enforce that law in line with our values and in line with the responsibility that\'s also mandated by the law to treat those who are apprehended in a humanitarian way.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re balancing a lot of different imperatives here.\xc2\xa0 But first and foremost, this administration is committed to enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The governor of Texas, Governor Perry, is testifying today before a Homeland Security Committee, before Congress, which is meeting in Texas today.\xc2\xa0 He has criticized the President for what he says is \xe2\x80\x9cbad diplomacy,\xe2\x80\x9d for speeches and for a general outlook to people down there in Central America that just says, \xe2\x80\x9ccome.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Even though -- and he believes that if the President were to rescind DACA, that that would send a message that that\'s not the case.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration think about rescinding the DREAM Act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The truth is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take seriously Governor Perry\xe2\x80\x99s concerns when everybody who has taken a look at this understands that if we wanted to send a clear signal about our seriousness of purpose when it comes to addressing some of the problems in our immigration system that the easiest way to do that is to pass the common-sense immigration reform proposal that already has passed through the Senate with bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>So I guess what I would observe is that the most effective way for us to address this problem -- and I think the most effective way that Governor Perry can help if that\'s what he says he wants to do would be to pick up the phone and call the Republican members of the House of Representatives that represent the state of Texas and tell them to support the bipartisan proposal to reform our immigration system that passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That would have a tangible impact on so many of the problems that we see in our immigration system -- not just the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing at the border, although it would address them because it includes significant investments in border security, but that compromised proposal would also have enormous economic benefits for communities all across the country, probably even disproportionate benefits for some of those communities along the border like those communities in Texas that we would see significant expansion in economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 It would create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It would lower the deficit. It also would ensure that companies are not punished for following the immigration laws.</p>\n<p>Right now there are a lot of companies that are trying to do the right thing and follow the current immigration guidelines when it comes to hiring workers.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re often undercut by unscrupulous companies that are willing to pay people under the table and not follow those immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 We need to take away that incentive, and one way we could do that would be by passing comprehensive immigration reform.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of reasons that this should get done.\xc2\xa0 And the only reason it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t is because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans, principally in the House of Representatives, but some other Republicans who have significant stature in that party who have made -- engaged in a coordinated political effort to block it and they do that without any particularly persuasive justification.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m not hearing, though, Josh -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have an answer for this -- is, why would -- why not send a message that -- Republicans say the DREAM Act sends a message to people in Central America, come because eventually you can become a citizen here, and that we are -- even though the law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to them, that it sends a message.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that?</p>\n<p>You disagree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- there may be some who think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a coded message in all of that, but the President of the United States, in an interview with your network just last week, sent a very clear, transparent, unmistakable message that parents should not put their children in the hands of criminals to transport them to the southwest border with the expectation that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcomed into the country.\xc2\xa0 They won\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Setting aside the fact that putting your children in the hands of a criminal for a dangerous journey like that can have tragic consequences, that is not something that a parent should even consider at this point.\xc2\xa0 The President has been unmistakable about sending that signal.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Vice President and the Secretary of State travel to the region to deliver that message directly.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been communicated to the leaders of those countries who have also communicated that message to their citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been transparent about how the law will be applied in these cases.\xc2\xa0 And it seems to me that those who might be complaining about the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions are more interested in landing political blows than they are in trying to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about having the President unequivocally -- it sounded at first ambiguous.\xc2\xa0 And then you were saying that eventually -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is making it clear that these children will not be able to stay, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get deported.\xc2\xa0 It will take time, the system will -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be deported.\xc2\xa0 The President of the United States is the loudest voice in this country.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this message needs to get to Honduras, to Guatemala, to these places.\xc2\xa0 Why not have the President unequivocally sit in front of a camera and say, look, these kids are going to get deported; don\xe2\x80\x99t do this; this is dangerous; they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be able to stay here; whatever anybody is telling you it\xe2\x80\x99s not true and it only -- maybe only the President can send that message.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, I think the President was pretty direct when he made comments to George Stephanopoulos at ABC when he was asked specifically about this.\xc2\xa0 George asked him very directly whether or not parents should send their children to the southwest border with the expectation that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcomed here, and the President was clear in saying, do not send your children.</p>\n<p>So the President has delivered that message unambiguously.\xc2\xa0 That is part of the law.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been a message that\xe2\x80\x99s been echoed by the Vice President when he traveled to the region, by the Secretary of State when he traveled to the region, and by the leaders of the countries in those regions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say without ambiguity that most of these kids are going to get deported?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can say without ambiguity is that the law will be applied and there is going to be a due process that they\xe2\x80\x99ll all be subjected to.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand here and say how those claims will be processed; it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be appropriate for me to do so.\xc2\xa0 But the law will be rigorously applied.\xc2\xa0 And to ensure that it\xe2\x80\x99s rigorously applied, we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for additional resources so that we can have more prosecutors and judges and asylum officials deployed to this region to more efficiently process these cases within the confines of the law.\xc2\xa0 And they will be rigorously following the law.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve even sought additional authority that can be wielded by the Secretary of Homeland Security so that when those cases have been processed, that those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legal claim for remaining in this country can be returned to their home country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you guys are supposedly stepping up an ad campaign. Can you tell us more about it, trying to -- explain what this campaign is down in these countries?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have those details in front of me.\xc2\xa0 I know that Gil Kerlikowske, who is the Director of the CBP, was down in the region just yesterday and talking about this.\xc2\xa0 So I would refer you to CBP.\xc2\xa0 They will have some more details about that campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to appear in this campaign?\xc2\xa0 Are they going to use his image, his voice, his words in this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what plans they have for the content of that campaign, but you should check with them and they can tell you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they did you would know, so obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s -- I would assume you would know, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are probably a lot of important things I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To quickly follow up on the economy and to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question here, which is, neither party has gotten what they\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted in what they claim would sort of jumpstart the economy over the last three or four years.\xc2\xa0 So his question was obviously does anybody deserve the credit.\xc2\xa0 But do you -- does the President feel vindicated that his economic philosophy is contributing to this economic recovery?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the President believes that some of the economic policies that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place over the last five and a half years have contributed to some of the economic growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 What we have said all along is that the goal of these policies was to support the private sector as they lead our recovery.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is not a situation where the government can go in and do it for the private sector.\xc2\xa0 What we need is, we need American entrepreneurs and business owners and American workers to lead that recovery, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only because of the hard work and grit and determination of the American people that we\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed this success and made all of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>What the President wants to do is to capitalize on this progress and make sure that the benefits of this recovery aren\xe2\x80\x99t just flowing to those at the top, but actually are flowing to those in the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that the President is strongly supportive of raising the minimum wage -- that if you\xe2\x80\x99re working full-time and trying to raise a family of four, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that in poverty.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons the President wants to lower the cost of a college education to give more middle-class families the opportunity to send their kid to college and get the skills they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to succeed in the 21st century global economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have a -- this has been an uneven economic recovery -- does believe that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we can do to make sure that all the benefits of our strengthening economy flow to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Because the President believes if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sustain this economic recovery over the long term that we need to grow this economy from the middle out, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that if all the benefits of the recovery are flowing to those at the top.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are middle-class families who are benefitting from this recovery.\xc2\xa0 The President wants to make sure that we build on that progress and that by investing in job training, raising the minimum wage, investments in infrastructure would have a short-term economic benefit in terms of creating jobs, but also lay the foundation for our long-term economic strength.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that we can do.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss this opportunity to capitalize on this growth and make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The best six months in 15 years, and it comes at a time at the highest rate of Washington dysfunction and gridlock in perhaps that amount of time.\xc2\xa0 Coincidence?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t this sending the message that, you know what, the less Washington does, the better for the economy?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the message --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not to be that cynical, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the message that this sends is it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that these crises aren\xe2\x80\x99t created overnight and they\'re not solved overnight; and that there needs to be a long-term, coordinated strategy to strengthen our economy.\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this President do over the course of five and a half years is put in place the pillars of that strategy.\xc2\xa0 From the Recovery Act, to rescuing the auto industry, to Wall Street reform, which I had the opportunity to talk about earlier -- all of these are key components of supporting the kind of foundation that the private sector in this country needs to lead our recovery.</p>\n<p>And we have seen our economy bounce back.\xc2\xa0 The President is not surprised about that.\xc2\xa0 One of the reasons he has so much optimism about the America economy is because he knows that there are American entrepreneurs out there that have all kinds of great ideas that can lead to the creation of small businesses and eventually grow those businesses into large businesses; that there are a lot of American workers out there who aren\xe2\x80\x99t fully utilizing the skills that they have to benefit our economy.\xc2\xa0 So we want to capture that potential and double down on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made.</p>\n<p>And that\'s why the President is so determined to both try and work with Congress where we can to implement other policies that will benefit the middle class, but where necessary, the President is not going to hesitate within the confines of the law to move unilaterally to get that done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on that point, if you still have more than 26 million people who are in part-time jobs -- you talk to youth advocacy groups, they say that the unemployment number for young people who have given up looking and are unemployed is about 15.2 percent.\xc2\xa0 If the economy is strengthening so much, and the recovery is getting stronger as you say, why are so many people still looking for full-time work?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s due in no small part to Republicans blocking common-sense economic proposals that would expand economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, there are some simple things that the President has put forward, common-sense ideas that have traditionally earned the support of Republicans in the past that Republicans right now are blocking. These are things like raising the minimum wage; making critical investments in our infrastructure and paying for them by closing the loopholes that benefit only the wealthy and well-connected; investing in job-training programs that lead directly to work; expanding access to a college education, making more affordable for middle-class families to send their kids to college.</p>\n<p>These are all the kinds of things that would ensure that middle-class families are benefitting from our economic recovery. And those benefits would be magnified if we can put in place some of these common-sense policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a couple on immigration.\xc2\xa0 When you were saying a moment ago that the law will be rigorously followed -- a couple weeks ago, Jim was asking questions about what are the numbers in terms of people who show up at the border who actually are deported, and how many of them actually stay with relatives and end up staying in America.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a better sense now of those numbers?\xc2\xa0 My question being, how can you know for sure the law is going to be followed when some of these folks may just end up staying in America?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, each of these cases is unique, and what we would like to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re surging resources in terms of immigration judges and ICE prosecutors and asylum officials to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re processing these claims quickly and doing so efficiently, so that when they are ultimately adjudicated and if those individuals, after going through that due process, are found not to have an illegal basis for remaining in the country, that the Secretary of Homeland Security can act using his discretion to send them back.\xc2\xa0 That is a principle that applies to adults, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a principle that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to apply where necessary --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you need numbers to back up that that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening in recent months and years?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the law has been enforced under this President.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, though, is an increasing backlog in processing these claims; that there are individuals who are detained, who are given a notice to appear in court; in many cases, they\xe2\x80\x99re subjected to things like alternative detention where they wear an ankle bracelet.\xc2\xa0 But that backlog is too long. That\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to those who are in that process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also not a good way to enforce the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We want to do this quickly and efficiently and effectively, all within the confines of due process.\xc2\xa0 So by adding more judges and prosecutors and asylum officials to the case, we can make sure that we are following due process but also enforcing the law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the Texas trip, related to immigration.\xc2\xa0 The President keeps saying publicly he wants to get out of the White House bubble.\xc2\xa0 So here\xe2\x80\x99s his chance, and as you said, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to meet with some real folks and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk to them about the economy.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also going to raise money for the Democratic Party and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pass up an opportunity to get an up-close look himself, get out of the bubble and look at what he\xe2\x80\x99s called a humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 How do you defend that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I defend that by describing to you that there are a whole range of senior officials in this administration over the course of the last three or four weeks who have spent a lot of time in the southwest border.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when there\xe2\x80\x99s a hurricane you\xe2\x80\x99ll send the FEMA Director, all these people, but then the President himself goes there and he meets with the families, he hold their hands, he talks to them and he tries to get a sense -- why can\xe2\x80\x99t he do that this time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has a very good sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the border.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s getting regular updates from his officials who have traveled to that region.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re focused on solving this problem.\xc2\xa0 And what the President wants is he wants regular reports about what they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the border and how resources that are being devoted to processing those who have appeared at the border are being used to effectively administrate justice.\xc2\xa0 And the President is well aware of that process and how it\xe2\x80\x99s going.</p>\n<p>And the trip that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking to Texas is effectively for a different purpose -- both to conduct some political activities that he does on occasion, but also spend some time talking to somebody who wrote him a letter about how the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies can benefit middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>Lesley.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the Kurds\xe2\x80\x99 bid for autonomy, how much does that complicate your message?\xc2\xa0 And what are you saying to the Kurds themselves?\xc2\xa0 You said, I think, Iraq is stronger if it\xe2\x80\x99s united.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they believe that they would be stronger there in a fragile Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the message from the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of dialogue between senior administration officials and political leaders in Iraq, including Kurdish political leaders.\xc2\xa0 Our message to them in private is the same message that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering up here publicly, which is that we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of all the citizens of Iraq for that nation\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to come together, to set aside sectarian divisions, to set aside their own political ambitions, and focus on the best interest of Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of this administration that Iraq is best served if they have political leaders that unite, that pursue an inclusive governing agenda, and use all of that to confront a threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you in just a second, Bill.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to the border issue and the President not going and how he gets his updates.\xc2\xa0 When the President is in the Situation Room, is he getting -- seeing live pictures of the border?\xc2\xa0 Is he getting kind of visuals on the border?\xc2\xa0 And is that some of the reason why he may not be going to the border next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there have been some media outlets that have even been granted access to some of these detention facilities along the border. so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty transparent and I think the American public can see firsthand both the challenges that are posed by this surge and illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, but they can also see firsthand what the federal government is doing to try to address the challenges that are posed by this surge.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen frequent visits from these senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is getting regular updates and has a very good sense both of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there on the ground, and how effectively resources are being deployed to confront those challenges.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But beyond the updates, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to -- the reason people are asking for him to go to the border is because it\'s\xc2\xa0 tangible for him to see, for him to feel.\xc2\xa0 But is he at least getting visuals from these persons, or getting updates?\xc2\xa0 Is he getting any visuals in the Sit Room, live visuals of something about the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I disagree at least in part with the premise of your question.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that some people are suggesting the President should go to the border when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Texas is because they\xe2\x80\x99d rather play politics than actually try to address some of these challenges.\xc2\xa0 But for those who have purer motives in terms of asking this question, like you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- I would just tell you that the President is comfortable with the very granular information that he\xe2\x80\x99s received about conditions on the border and about what the federal government is doing to meet these challenges.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s also very interested in finding out whether or not this surge in resources has been helpful, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s worked, whether we are able to enforce the law more efficiently and at the same time meet the basic humanitarian needs of those who have appeared on the southwest border.</p>\n<p>We are, after all, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say in discussing this issue many times, we\xe2\x80\x99re a nation of laws but we\xe2\x80\x99re also a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 And there are values associated with that.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that as we enforce the law, that we do so in line with our values.\xc2\xa0 The President is comfortable that that\'s happening right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another issue, Mrs. Biden is in Africa.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to me about the Africa visit?\xc2\xa0 And is it primarily basically a lead-up to this Africa summit that\'s happening here next month?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For a detailed readout of her activities I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s Office.\xc2\xa0 But I know that Dr. Biden is -- that her trip is off to a very good start.\xc2\xa0 She just left a couple of days ago.\xc2\xa0 She spent some time visiting some local health clinics, talking a lot about the importance of education, particularly among women in Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is an important part of communicating directly to the people of Africa the investment that the United States seeks to make in their countries; that there is an opportunity for us to form an important partnership with them as they build the economy and build up and improve the living conditions in many of these countries, that the United States wants to be a partner with them.\xc2\xa0 That is an important message of Dr. Biden\xe2\x80\x99s trip, and it will be something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss a whole lot more when the African leaders are here in Washington next month.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just as an aside, your answer to April about the President not going to the border because it would be political</p>\n<p>-- since when is it not political that he goes and visits with an average American to show empathy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is those who are criticizing the President for not going to the border, that at least many of them, if not all of them, are playing politics and not really focused on solving the problem.\xc2\xa0 If they were committed to solving the problem -- for example, in the case of the Texas Governor, he could probably be pretty useful -- I hear he\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty persuasive fellow, that he could call -- he could pick up the phone and call some of those Republican members of Congress from Texas who are standing foursquare against common-sense immigration reform; that if the Governor were genuinely concerned about solving so many of these problems that exist on the border, the most impactful thing that he could do right now is encourage those Republican members of the House of Representatives to stop blocking common-sense legislation from coming to the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which doesn\'t have much to do with the President\xe2\x80\x99s own politics in sitting down with -- anyway, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to your answer on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the policy of this administration since the ISIS offensive began that it has to be settled by the formation of a new government which is all inclusive.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s not happening.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister, as you know, has declined to form a government because everybody walked out in a huff the other day.\xc2\xa0 And now he\xe2\x80\x99s going after -- first of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s going after the ISIS fighters he says.\xc2\xa0 But what is the message of this government?\xc2\xa0 What has the President said to him or others?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the Vice President who has been in regular touch with Prime Minister Maliki and with other political leaders in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 What we have encouraged them to do is to -- there is, as you point out, a process under the Iraqi constitution for the formation of a new government --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not working.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not moving as expeditiously as we would like it to, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 Time is of the essence right now because there is a serious threat to the security situation there that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And so the President and other world leaders have been pressing Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership not just to come together at a time and place of their choosing, but come together quickly, because it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the future of Iraq for them to form that government in line with the process that\xe2\x80\x99s laid out by their constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And once that government is formed, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for that government to pursue the kind of inclusive governing agenda that makes it clear to every citizen in Iraq that they have a stake in that country\xe2\x80\x99s future.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required for the security forces in Iraq to be strengthened; that the security forces need to reflect the diversity of the country, and when you have a unified political leadership, you have unified security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that Iraq can meet the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL, but we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to meet that threat if they don\xe2\x80\x99t act quickly to form that government and for that government to pursue an inclusive agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- before the government is formed.\xc2\xa0 There have been suggestions that they could work in cooperation with Iran, and that the U.S. could support that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, General Dempsey today said that while we don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to coordinate with them right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible that in the future we would have reason to do so.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the administration supports?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have said is, and what\xe2\x80\x99s already occurred is that there has been at least one conversation between senior American diplomats and senior Iranian diplomats on the sidelines of the P5-plus-1 talks to talk about the situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that at this point we don\xe2\x80\x99t contemplate any military cooperation and coordination.\xc2\xa0 We also are not going to be engaged in a conversation with the Iranians about the future of Iraq over the heads of the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, the future of Iraq needs to be determined by the population, by the citizens of Iraq, and by their elected leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99ve also pointed out and been pretty ready to admit that there clearly is some overlapping interest here, that there is -- it is not in the interests of Iran for there to be -- for their neighbor to be racked by sectarian divisions; that that kind of instability is not what you want to have on your border. And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the kind of instability that the United States would like to see in the region.</p>\n<p>So there is a little common interest that\xe2\x80\x99s been exposed by this.\xc2\xa0 But I want to be clear that our ongoing diplomatic conversations with Iran right now are focused on this nuclear issue that\xe2\x80\x99s hopefully going to be resolved with the P5-plus-1.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the door to cooperation does not seem to be closed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional conversations between American diplomats and Iranian diplomats, but they would be separate from the ongoing P5-plus-1 talks that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On bank bonuses -- surprise, surprise -- listening to the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on Marketplace, talking about taking more action on the bank bonuses and he believes they\xe2\x80\x99re risky -- well, his Treasury Department, jointly with the Fed and other regulatory agencies, back in 2011, issued a draft proposal under the Dodd-Frank law to take action to restrict these bonuses, and since then it\xe2\x80\x99s been languishing on the back burner at the SEC.\xc2\xa0 Is one of the additional steps he\xe2\x80\x99s considering to push the SEC to do something with this proposal?\xc2\xa0 Any sense of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I think I mentioned earlier, the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific regulation or law in mind when he made those comments to Kai Ryssdal.\xc2\xa0 What he was referring to, though, was the need for his administration and independent regulators to continue to be vigilant about threats that may emerge in our financial system.\xc2\xa0 We have a very dynamic, rapidly evolving financial system, and we need to make sure that we have a regulator regime that can meet the risks and challenges that are posed by that dynamic system.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied with what\xe2\x80\x99s been done so far, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, I actually think the President is proud of all the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is dissatisfied that that\xe2\x80\x99s enough -- sorry.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing I\xe2\x80\x99m not the spokesman.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to my world, Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he dissatisfied with the amount of progress so far even if he feels there has been progress on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me start by saying it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I undersold it -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that I think that the passage of Wall Street reform in the first couple of years of this administration will go down as one of the legacy-defining achievements of this administration.\xc2\xa0 The President is enormously proud of the Wall Street reform regulations that have been put in place because they include some of the strongest consumer protections in history.</p>\n<p>The President ran for office because he wanted to make sure that middle-class families had a voice in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to things like financial regulations, too often the voices of Main Street investors and middle-class families were drowned out by special interests like Wall Street firms and big banks.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re enormously proud of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made and that we do now have a financial system that continues to thrive.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert on the stock market, but it has increased significantly since the President took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like from what he was saying that he clearly thinks more should be done.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any other fair reading of his remarks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 And what the President thinks is that we need to be vigilant as our financial system evolves in terms of guarding against risks that crop up; that there\xe2\x80\x99s such a dynamic financial system out there that evolves quickly -- we need to make sure that we have a regulatory regime that gives the dynamism of our capital markets the opportunity to thrive while preventing bubbles and other risks from rapidly emerging and causing the whole system to tumble.</p>\n<p>So let me give you a couple of examples of things that the President believes should be part of the kinds of things that should be addressed.\xc2\xa0 One of those things is the role of shadow banking and the role that they play in our financial markets.\xc2\xa0 The President also believes that we need to protect the integrity of our financial markets from abuses in high-frequency trading.</p>\n<p>The President also believes that we need to have the seamless application of regulations in our international markets. Those of you who have traveled with us to G20 meetings over the years have heard countless briefings from senior administration officials who say that the President and other senior economic policymakers in this administration have been in regular communication with our counterparts in other markets about the importance of also raising standards for their financial markets.</p>\n<p>After all, we can\'t just raise the financial standards in this market when you have such a globally interconnected financial system.\xc2\xa0 We need to raise standards all across the globe.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been a focal point of some of the ongoing policymaking efforts in this administration.</p>\n<p>So, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly vigilant and on guard about -- as we monitor the financial system and make sure that risks don\'t crop up that threaten the entire financial system.\xc2\xa0 And that means hard work that\'s done on a daily basis by economic policymakers in the administration, but also work that\'s done on a daily basis at the independent financial regulators who have front-line responsibility for dealing with some of these issues.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 According to what purports to be minutes from the last meeting of Secretary Kerry and Prime Minister Maliki, he was quoted as telling Maliki that the United States does not believe that all the fighters in Iraq belong to ISIL or are affiliated with extremist organizations.\xc2\xa0 Is that the reason why the President is still hesitant about striking ISIL in Iraq, launching airstrikes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is going to make his decision about any sort of financial -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m still focused on the last question.\xc2\xa0 Any decision that the President makes about military actions in Iraq will be focused on our core national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s driving that decision, and that is what will continue to drive the decision moving forward.</p>\n<p>So what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is in recent days the announcement of deployment of some additional troops to Iraq with the sole purpose of ensuring the safety and security of American personnel who are already in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That is the President\xe2\x80\x99s top goal, and that is what he has assessed thus far in terms of deploying military assets in support of our broader national security interests.</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that the President has said -- and the President said this more eloquently than I will -- about three weeks ago when he was standing in front of Marine One, where he said it was incumbent upon Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to form that inclusive government because that ultimately is what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be necessary to address the security situation in Iraq; that any sort of military solution is only going to temporarily address the problems that they face, that the ultimate solution will require a governing agenda by a diverse political leadership in Iraq that unites the country in the face of the threat that\'s posed by ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he still maintain that any direct military assistance, actual assistance -- airstrikes against the ISIL locations, for example, is still preconditioned on that inclusive government?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President again was pretty clear, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you back to his comments.\xc2\xa0 They still apply in terms of how he perceives the situation, that it is critically important for the government of Iraq to unite in the face of this threat and that any sort of military action will need to be partnered with a commitment from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to do exactly that.\xc2\xa0 Because ultimately, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution to this problem; there\xe2\x80\x99s a diplomatic and political solution that will ultimately address so many of the significant challenges that are facing Iraq right now.</p>\n<p>Jared.\xc2\xa0 Jared, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when it comes to Iraq, the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to the King of Saudi Arabia yesterday, did the President discuss at all reports that the Kingdom might be funding ISIS?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\'t have any more details on that call other than what was included in the readout.\xc2\xa0 In terms of funding, one of the things that was mentioned in the readout was that there was a significant donation made by the Kingdom in support of ongoing humanitarian efforts in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That was something that the President greatly appreciated.\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates the kind of regional approach that we think is going to be important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for countries in the region that the kind of instability that started out in Syria and has spilled over into Iraq doesn\'t continue to spread across the region.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s one of the reasons that -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to Saudi Arabia that some stability be restored, but also underscores the generosity of the Kingdom in making this donation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re heading into the long weekend.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got on the House calendar, at least, I think seven legislative weeks before Election Day.\xc2\xa0 The President has been talking all this week and recently about how little he expects from Congress or how little he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten from Congress.\xc2\xa0 At this point, from where you\xe2\x80\x99re standing, what does the President believe he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get in terms of bills passed by both houses of Congress before Election Day?\xc2\xa0 Anything?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of important priorities that I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the context of the jobs numbers today.\xc2\xa0 Some of the economic proposals that the President has put forward for raising the minimum wage, or improving and expanding job training, making a college education more affordable, ensuring pay equity all across the country -- that there are a number of proposals that have traditionally earned bipartisan support that the President hopes they\xe2\x80\x99ll act on.</p>\n<p>But there are two others that come to mind that will be priorities when Congress returns.\xc2\xa0 The first is the supplemental funding request that Julie talked about in terms of making sure that our -- that the necessary resources are available to meet the need caused by the surge of illegal migration that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing at the border.</p>\n<p>The second one is this issue of the Highway Trust Fund that I think Mara asked about yesterday, that this is traditionally an issue that has enjoyed bipartisan support, and we hope that will be true in this case because of the consequences of Congress failing to act for our economy.</p>\n<p>With that, why don\'t I do a little week ahead here?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only Thursday, but I have a sneaking suspicion that many of you won\xe2\x80\x99t be here tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No briefing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There will be no briefing tomorrow in honor of the holiday.\xc2\xa0 What better way to demonstrate my patriotism than to not brief, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Happy Fourth.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Same to you, Goyal.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President will host a group of teachers at the White House for lunch to discuss the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to ensure that every student is taught by an effective educator. The President will be joined at that lunch by the Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will welcome NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen to the White House, ahead of the NATO summit in Wales this September.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing with the Secretary General the crisis in Ukraine and related reassurance measures for our NATO allies; improving allied defense investment; further work on bolstering NATO\xe2\x80\x99s network of partners; and NATO\xe2\x80\x99s post-2014 noncombat mission in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary General\xe2\x80\x99s visit underscores the vital importance the United States places on NATO as the cornerstone of our alliance with Europe.</p>\n<p>In the evening, the President will depart for Denver, Colorado, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday in Denver, the President will attend a DSCC fundraising event.\xc2\xa0 The President will then travel to the Dallas, Texas area for a DCCC event.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will get back on the plane and will travel to Austin, Texas, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll attend a DNC event and remain overnight.</p>\n<p>On Thursday while in Austin, the President will attend a DNC event, and will deliver remarks on the economy alongside one of the letter writers that I mentioned earlier, before returning to the White House.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Colorado and Texas in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>And then on Friday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>I should point out that tomorrow the President does have a couple of Independence Day activities.\xc2\xa0 Somebody asked earlier about the naturalization event that will take place here.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the opportunity to naturalizing a few immigrants to this country who have served in our armed forces.</p>\n<p>And then tomorrow evening, the President will be hosting a barbecue and picnic for military families on the South Lawn of the White House where late in the day those families will enjoy a spectacular view of the fireworks on the National Mall.</p>\n<p>So with that I wish you all a very happy Independence Day and a terrific weekend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any Saturday events?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nothing Saturday or Sunday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any press conferences coming up soon?</p>\n<p>MR.
