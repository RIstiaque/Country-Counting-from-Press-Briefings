PDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements, so let\xe2\x80\x99s do questions.\xc2\xa0 Rapid fire.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s mood during this trip?\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be enjoying himself last night.\xc2\xa0 Is he enjoying getting back into campaign mode, talking to his supporters?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is in a good mood, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 I think he likes getting out of Washington.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a sort of anti-Washington thing so much as he just really enjoys getting beyond the Beltway, interacting with people.\xc2\xa0 I think he -- this trip in particular he\xe2\x80\x99s been happy about because of the town hall at Facebook, the town hall he\xe2\x80\x99s doing today.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of events really I think give him some energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe likes to -- he often takes questions from you and questions from his staff in policy meetings and all that kind of stuff, and it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to do it directly with other Americans.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s in a good mood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did that Gen 44 event go last night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was great.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he definitely -- he clearly had fun and there was a lot of energy in the room.\xc2\xa0 He clearly enjoyed it and had some good lines.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- enjoy today\xe2\x80\x99s fundraiser?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did, actually --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was his reaction --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was talking about it when he came out.\xc2\xa0 He was\xc2\xa0 -- he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\'t get that every day,\xe2\x80\x9d I think was the quote when he came out.\xc2\xa0 And he thought it was kind of funny.\xc2\xa0 And like he said after, it sort of broke his flow a little bit, but he took it, as I think Carol wrote in her pool report, took it in stride.\xc2\xa0 It certainly perked up the morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you describe a little about what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing to keep up with Libya, given that the -- the ongoing events in Misurata are about what you\xe2\x80\x99d expected when he went into Benghazi?\xc2\xa0 And is he doing -- is the United States likely to do any more to help out there?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we\'re doing quite a bit, working with our -- as part of the coalition, to answer your last question.\xc2\xa0 And he has obviously national security staff with him and he\xe2\x80\x99s briefed regularly, and he -- I mean, I don\'t have any specifics on the phone calls he\xe2\x80\x99s made, but he\xe2\x80\x99s in touch with senior staff back at the White House pretty regularly.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten a lot of updates.\xc2\xa0 He was updated obviously on the loss of two journalists yesterday, the terrible loss, including an American.\xc2\xa0 But he is constantly updated on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu when he comes to Washington to address Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling updates.\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 There may be a firm answer to that, I\'m just -- I\'m not sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President often talks about disagreeing without being disagreeable.\xc2\xa0 How do you reconcile that with calling Republicans \xe2\x80\x9cshortsighted\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking a lot about this because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the speech the President gave on Wednesday and every time he speaks about it, he always calls for and describes the need for bipartisan cooperation and compromise, and expresses optimism about the willingness to do it.\xc2\xa0 And I think sometimes what\xe2\x80\x99s absent -- and then he also goes on to describe the stark contrast between his vision and the vision outlaid in the House Republican budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 But -- and both are true.\xc2\xa0 He thinks there are stark contrasts, but he thinks that because the times demand it, the economy demands it, the budget demands it, the deficits demand it and the people demand it, that we need to and can find some common ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThat part of -- that observation you don\'t often hear when some lawmakers in Congress are critical of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 All you hear is the criticism, and you don\'t hear the acknowledgement that the only way to get this done is through bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 There is not an option to do a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or highway.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the President is not going to get everything he wants and the Republicans are not going to get everything they want, and they\'re certainly not going to get the House Republican budget passed and made law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, Cantor, who was just recently appointed to be part of the group that will negotiate this with the President, said yesterday that small concessions are not going to be enough by the Democrats, by the President.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell me what\xe2\x80\x99s going on as far as negotiations now between now and May 5th?\xc2\xa0 And also are you -- what is your response to that, that more needs to be done in terms of spending cuts?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, obviously, Congress is in recess and a number of leaders are in various places around the country and the globe, so the first major meeting will be May 5th.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of contact with -- if you guys feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re in danger, just let me know -- with the turbulence.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of contact among staffs and obviously the phones work around the world, so those conversations continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Congressman Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s statement, I would simply say that\xc2\xa0 -- I would point to the fact that he and other leaders from both parties have made clear that the debt ceiling has to be raised, that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s risky to suggest that if he or others did not get what they wanted, they would then throw the government into default.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a pretty bold assertion.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with statements that Speaker Boehner, Senate Minority Leader McConnell, or others have made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd we think the preponderance of statements by Republican leaders has been in accord with what the President has said, which is that we have to raise the debt ceiling no matter what -- even as we pursue, in the same time frame, aggressively bipartisan negotiations on reaching some sort of agreement on deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut what the President has said and others said is you cannot hold one hostage to the other.\xc2\xa0 We certainly think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible and it can be done to get that kind of agreement by June.\xc2\xa0 But if something happens and it\xe2\x80\x99s not, you can\xe2\x80\x99t say, well, then we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to let the United States government go into default, tank the economy, send the economy into recession, not just domestically but globally.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that would be the height of irresponsibility.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- like an agreement on that.\xc2\xa0 You just said by June.\xc2\xa0 Do you want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, these are tough issues, but obviously we look forward to the first meeting that the Vice President will oversee on May 5th.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean on the debt ceiling, though, specifically.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, on the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling for timely -- a timely vote.\xc2\xa0 Congress is obviously in recess, but we hope they would act expeditiously.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he laid the groundwork with the Vice President in the past few days, or talked with him to lay the groundwork for the talks that start on May 5th?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any readouts of specific conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had lately, but they obviously talk about this a lot and meet about it a lot.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifics on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when you say that the President is engaged and phones work around the world -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that a few times -- what do you mean by that?\xc2\xa0 Who is he talking to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the fact that Congress is out of session and, in this case, at least several days the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t in Washington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that if a decision has to be made or a discussion has to take place between the President or the Vice President and congressional leaders -- it can happen.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that any of that has happened?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGoodness gracious.\xc2\xa0 I hope people were counting on holding onto their breakfast.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But any other questions, guys?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the fundraiser, can we use that audio from the fundraiser, given that there was news in that fundraiser?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think whatever the rules basically are we\xe2\x80\x99re going to stick to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the rules, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be clear?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this longer than I have, but I believe -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll check.\xc2\xa0 It was print only, right?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Audio for note-taking and transcription.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We can talk about it afterwards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to us?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 All right, guys, strap in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:09 A.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
