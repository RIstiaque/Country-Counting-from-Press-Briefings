EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello.\xc2\xa0 This is kind of nice.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements, so let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Describe for us what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do on the ground.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, as you know, this is a trip that was planned on very short notice, for obvious reasons, so we don\'t have a lot of details that we can provide to you about what will happen on the ground.\xc2\xa0 He will obviously view the damage caused by these horrific storms and tornadoes and meet with families who\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered greatly from this, and with local officials.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, we\'re just going to have to report on it as it unfolds.\xc2\xa0 Unlike a lot of events, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a great deal of advanced choreography.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a statement from him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, you can expect the President will make remarks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to accomplish with this visit to Alabama?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he wants to witness for himself the terrible devastation caused by these storms, to make clear the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to helping in any way that it can, and to I think put a spotlight for the rest of America on the kind of suffering that a storm like this can cause to so many families and businesses.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it just he and the First Lady?\xc2\xa0 Or what are the girls going to be doing during this Alabama portion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on the President\xe2\x80\x99s daughters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit -- staying with disasters, the governor of Texas has been rather critical of the federal relief for his state that suffered the wildfires.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the wildfires, I don\'t have a great deal of specific information with me here, but in fact, federal funding for wildfire fighting has been extensive in Texas.\xc2\xa0 But I know that Nick Shapiro and the press office has a lot of detail on that for you.\xc2\xa0 So our response has been quite strong on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Priorities USA fundraising group seems to be doing the same thing the President has long opposed by raising unlimited secret donations.\xc2\xa0 Why is the White House allowing them to do this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we\'re not -- I read those reports.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t allow outside groups one way or the other to do what they do in terms of campaign activity.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we don\'t control outside groups.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on disclosure is the same today as it has always been.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A former White House spokesman is leading the group.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously some --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I read that story, too, but again, we can\'t -- these are not people working for the administration and we can\'t control their activity.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on disclosure remains the same.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s vitally important.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he disapproves of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to characterize it except that the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on disclosure remains the same.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, will the President meet with Congresswoman Giffords at the Cape?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more I can tell you about -- hold on one second, it\xe2\x80\x99s right on my fingertips here.\xc2\xa0 As I think you know, the President and the First Family will view the launch of the Space Shuttle Endeavour with NASA Director Charles Bolden, Jr., and astronaut Dr. Janet Kavandi.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\'t have any information for you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously if he has other meetings we\'ll let you know if they take place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have been given guidance that he would be meeting with Giffords privately.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reason to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t confirm that at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a lighter question -- did he see the royal wedding or any of the -- anything that happened in Britain today?\xc2\xa0 Did he watch it?\xc2\xa0 Did Michelle Obama watch any of that?\xc2\xa0 Just talk about if he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken with the First Lady about it, but the President did mention that he caught a little bit of it this morning over breakfast, but obviously was busy getting ready for this trip.\xc2\xa0 And he also -- I think we\'re putting out some paper -- he met this morning, very early this morning in the Oval Office with some of the surviving members of the Memphis Sanitation strike.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'re putting out some paper on that as well as a photograph.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no reaction to the dress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a reaction to the dress.\xc2\xa0 I personally thought it was lovely and we wish -- all of us in the administration wish them the very best.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to make remarks in Cape Canaveral?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe we have anything set for that, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned is the White House about Egypt normalizing relations with Hamas and Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With -- I\'m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Hamas and Iran -- Egypt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'d ask you to check with folks back at the White House and the NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you tweeted about Paul Ryan in Wisconsin talking about subsidies.\xc2\xa0 In his budget proposal he has reducing corporate tax by 25 percent, so it was sort of in that language in the budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 Is that common ground that you\'re finding with Paul Ryan on gas company subsidies?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are two different things.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that -- the President supports lowering the corporate tax rate in a revenue-neutral way by eliminating loopholes.\xc2\xa0 But specifically on the subsidies of oil and gas companies, the President opposes that.\xc2\xa0 He believes that in a time of tight budgets, we can\'t afford it.\xc2\xa0 We need to invest that money, $4 billion per year, more than $43 billion over 10 years, that money should be invested in clean energy, energy of the future -- especially when the oil and gas companies, especially the big ones, show absolutely no need for taxpayer subsidies.\xc2\xa0 They are reporting this week substantial profits, in the tens of billions of dollars.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we welcome the statement by Congressman Ryan that he believes those subsidies should be eliminated.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President feels that way, has for a long time.\xc2\xa0 We were heartened also by the remarks of Speaker Boehner the other day in an interview with ABC, where he suggested that was something that should be looked at.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just think that American taxpayer money does not need to be used to subsidize oil and gas companies that are experiencing record profits, especially at a time when American taxpayers are paying such very high prices at the pump.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I try on the dollar?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You may try.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been comments from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury expressing a strong dollar.\xc2\xa0 But it has weakened.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration concerned that it\xe2\x80\x99s getting to a level that could have unintended consequences, disruptive influences, in markets?\xc2\xa0 The front page today of the Wall Street Journal, administration not concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any comment on the dollar, as I never do.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Secretary of Treasury for that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the commencement speech you can tell us?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can tell you a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.\xc2\xa0 As you know, tonight the President will deliver the commencement address at Miami Dade College to an audience of approximately 4,000 graduates, family members and faculty, to applaud their hard work and stress the importance of preserving the same focus and determination as they enter the next phase of their lives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will speak to the West and North Campus graduates at the James L. Knight International Center in downtown Miami.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will also receive his first honorary associate\xe2\x80\x99s degree and be presented with the Presidential Medallion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Miami Dade is an extraordinary story.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest institutions of higher education with -- get this -- more than 170,000 enrolled students, and in one of the largest minority-serving institutions, serving tens of thousands of Hispanic and African American students.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to education is strong and the initiative that he asked Dr. Biden to work on on community colleges is one that he thinks is very important.\xc2\xa0 So he looks forward to this event very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tell me about the speech for tomorrow for the White House Correspondents dinner.\xc2\xa0 Did he write it?\xc2\xa0 Is it -- who else is helping him write it?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s working on the jokes and how far along is he?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s highly classified information.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t reveal -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to come and see.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you writing some jokes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you writing any of the jokes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not.\xc2\xa0 There are far more talented joke writers than I who are working on the speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you please speak briefly to the President is going to NASA where the shuttle era is coming to an end, and in part because of his policies, numerous contractors and workers are going to be losing their jobs because of the direction which he\xe2\x80\x99s taking the space program.\xc2\xa0 What do you have to say about that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that President Obama laid out an ambitious plan, new plan for NASA, one that helps blaze a new trail of innovation and discovery.\xc2\xa0 Congress backed that plan and agreed with the President that we needed a new direction in space.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s plan invests more in NASA, extends the life of the international space station, launches a commercial space transportation industry, fosters the development of path-breaking technologies, and helps create thousands of new jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This important change in direction will not only help us chart a new path in space, but can help us retool for the industries and jobs of the future that will be vital for long-term economic growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the NASA Administrator has spoken to this quite a bit and I\'m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those comments.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re useful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe the commercial part of the industry is growing as it should, or is proceeding as it should? Is he satisfied with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a conversation with him on it specifically, but obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s his policy; he believes firmly that that\'s an important path to pursue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 That\'s it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 10:33 A.M.
