GMT</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I just want to emphasize how important the work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on agriculture is and I hope you got a sense from those folks who had set up their booths how much of a direct impact it can make in the lives of people in a really concrete way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got budget constraints back home, which means that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to come up with new and creative ways to promote development and deliver aid -- and this Food for the Future program and our New Alliance on Food Security is doing exactly that.\xc2\xa0 Every dollar that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting a huge amount of private-sector dollars.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on how do people become more productive as opposed to simply giving them food or giving them medicine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we announce later on this trip around power -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re calling Power Africa is going to be utilizing that same model.\xc2\xa0 But what you\xe2\x80\x99re really starting to see is people understanding what works, working with small producers, leveraging -- so, for example, you notice we\xe2\x80\x99re doing nutrition issues, but then also using it as an economic development tool.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And all that creates the kind of critical mass where, in a country like Senegal or Tanzania, where maybe 70 percent of the people are involved in agriculture, you can see each one of those small farmers suddenly increasing their income by 20 percent, 30 percent, 50 percent.\xc2\xa0 That then becomes the basis for a nascent middle class in those countries; that in turn can help create local manufacturers, local consumer goods.\xc2\xa0 And eventually, these then become export markets for the United States.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of alleviating hunger or reducing poverty; it\xe2\x80\x99s creating the basis for the entire continent to get incorporated into world markets in a way that ultimately will benefit not just Africa but also the United States.</p>\n<p>So our foreign aid budget is around 1 percent of our total federal budget.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s chronically the least popular part of our federal budget.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the bang for the buck that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting when it\xe2\x80\x99s done right, when it\xe2\x80\x99s well designed, and when it\xe2\x80\x99s scaled at the local level with input from local folks, it can really make a huge difference.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve designed I think is so effective that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to see other countries essentially put their money into a similar model, and we\xe2\x80\x99re also thereby leveraging all of international assistance around this issue.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud about and I know Raj Shah already had a chance to brief with you guys, but you should get to know him during the course of this trip because I think he can really give you insight in terms of how much difference this is making.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about this -- is this what you see as your legacy for Africa -- a kind of changed model?\xc2\xa0 I mean, a lot of analysts back in Washington are talking about how you\xe2\x80\x99re not making the kind of grand programs that Bush and Clinton did in Africa, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can address that a little bit.</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 First of all, if you look at a program like PEPFAR, President Bush deserves enormous credit for that.\xc2\xa0 It is really important.\xc2\xa0 And it saved lives of millions of people.\xc2\xa0 But even on PEPFAR, for example, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is transitioning so that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of delivering antiviral drugs; it\xe2\x80\x99s also how do we create a health infrastructure in these countries that\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think everything we do is designed to make sure that Africa is not viewed as a dependent, as a charity case, but is instead viewed as a partner; that instead of chronically receiving aid, it is starting to get involved in trade, get involved in production, and over time is going to be able to feed itself, house itself, and produce its own goods.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Africa wants.</p>\n<p>Now, some of this is driven by necessity.\xc2\xa0 Given the budget constraints, for us to try to get the kind of money that President Bush was able to get out of the Republican House for massively scaled new foreign aid programs is very difficult.\xc2\xa0 We could do even more with more resources.\xc2\xa0 But if we\xe2\x80\x99re working smarter, the amount of good that we can bring about over the next decade is tremendous.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, can you say -- one of the criticisms leveled at the United States is that it\xe2\x80\x99s fallen behind China in terms of the amount of attention that it gives to Africa.\xc2\xa0 President Xi has made numerous visits; this is your first extended visit.\xc2\xa0 How does the United States compete with China in terms of showing its interest and in the reduced-budget world that we\xe2\x80\x99re living in?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that China and India and Turkey and some of these other countries -- Brazil -- are paying a lot of attention to Africa.\xc2\xa0 This is not a zero-sum game.\xc2\xa0 This is not the Cold War.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got one global market, and if countries that are now entering into middle-income status see Africa as a big opportunity for them that can potentially help Africa.</p>\n<p>What we have going for us, though, is our values, our approach to development, our approach to democracy remains one that is greatly preferable to a country like Senegal.\xc2\xa0 In my discussions, a lot of people are pleased that China is involved in Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the other hand, they recognize that China\xe2\x80\x99s primary interest is being able to obtain access for natural resources in Africa to feed the manufacturers in export-driven policies of the Chinese economy.\xc2\xa0 And oftentimes that leaves Africa as simply an exporter of raw goods, not a lot of value added -- as a consequence, not a lot of jobs created inside of Africa, and it does not become the basis for long-term development.</p>\n<p>But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t view the participation of a country like China or Brazil in Africa as a bad thing.\xc2\xa0 It should be a signal to us, though, that there\xe2\x80\x99s great opportunity there and that we cannot afford to be left on the sidelines because we\xe2\x80\x99re still stuck with old stereotypes about what Africa\xe2\x80\x99s future is going to be.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of commitments do you think U.S. companies are looking for from you on this trip to be able to see Africa as a continent for investment?\xc2\xa0 And what kind of signal does the expo today -- what should that be sending to companies back home?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 One of the main things that we want American companies to see is that Africa is ready to do business and that there\xe2\x80\x99s huge potential there.\xc2\xa0 What African countries have to do -- and this is a message I\xe2\x80\x99m delivering consistently -- is ensure that there\xe2\x80\x99s stability and good governance so that American companies can reduce some of those risks that have nothing to do with business and have to do with will they be able to get their profits out, will they have to pay a bribe, will they have to find ways to negotiate with bureaucracies endlessly.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why our first message in Africa, in Senegal, revolved around issues of democracy, transparency, accountability.\xc2\xa0 There is a huge economic component to that.\xc2\xa0 Those countries where businesses can feel confident that there will be peaceful transitions of power, that corruption is prosecuted, where there\xe2\x80\x99s rule of law, where there\xe2\x80\x99s protection of private property, where the government is practical and not wildly ideological -- that is what will attract American businesses, because I think when I talk to a lot of CEOs, they see the potential there, but what they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do is find themselves five years out suddenly with a different government, suddenly their money is stuck, their workers are being shaken down -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing we want to make sure that we emphasize throughout this trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, looking forward to your trip in South Africa comes at a time when, obviously, a lot of people in the region are focused on the ailing health of Nelson Mandela.\xc2\xa0 I know you have a relationship with him -- do you hope to visit him?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that your message there will change?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think the message will be consistent because it draws on the lessons of Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s own life -- that if we focus on what Africa as a continent can do together and what these countries can do when they\xe2\x80\x99re unified, as opposed to when they\xe2\x80\x99re divided by tribe or race or religion, then Africa\xe2\x80\x99s rise will continue.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the central lessons of what Nelson Mandela accomplished not just as President, but in the struggle to overcome Apartheid and his years in prison.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the situation is when we land.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t need a photo-op, and the last thing I want to do is to be in any way obtrusive at a time when the family is concerned about Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to meet with him.\xc2\xa0 Michelle and the girls had an opportunity to meet with him.\xc2\xa0 Right now, our main concern is with his wellbeing, his comfort, and with the family\xe2\x80\x99s wellbeing and comfort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So when we get there we\xe2\x80\x99ll gauge the situation, but I think the main message we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to deliver if not directly to him but to his family is simply our profound gratitude for his leadership all these years and that the thoughts and prayers of the American people are with him, and his family, and his country.\xc2\xa0 I think in that sense, the sentiment of Americans is universally shared around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you gotten an update on his condition or talked to his family lately?</p>\n<p>THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll find out more when we land.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n11:36 A.M.
