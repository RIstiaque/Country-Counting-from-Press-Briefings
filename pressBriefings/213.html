Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t** Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:52 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Nancy, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the Iran nuclear deal, if the votes on the Hill go as expected, would the President plan to start lifting sanctions on September 17th?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nancy, I believe that both Majority Leader McConnell and the Senate committee chairman who wrote the legislation codifying how Congress would consider the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon have acknowledged that the 60-day clock for Congress\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of that agreement expires on September 17th.\xc2\xa0 And essentially I\'ve described previously that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s role here is not to provide their approval for the agreement, but they essentially had 60 days to play the spoiler.\xc2\xa0 And if the votes go the way that we think that they will, and I think everyone expects that they will, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity to play that role will expire next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that will be good news and it will mean that the international community can move forward with implementing the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how quickly would the President move on the sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Instantaneous or how does that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a specific timeframe to lay out at this point, but obviously this would -- September 17th would signal the end of the opportunity that Congress said they wanted to have to try to kill the agreement.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully they will not be successful in that effort, and it does not appear that they will.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll be able to move forward with the rest of the international community to implement this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the other thing that\'s important to remember, Nancy, and this is important for members of Congress to remember as well, Iran does not begin receiving sanctions relief until they fulfill the requirements that are included in the deal.\xc2\xa0 That means reducing their nuclear stockpile -- or their uranium stockpile by 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 It means rendering harmless their plutonium reactor at Arak, essentially shuts down any plutonium path that they may have had to build a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 It means essentially disconnecting thousands of centrifuges.\xc2\xa0 It means cooperating with the IAEA in their request for the access and information they need to write their report about the possible military dimensions of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s only after those steps have been taken and verified that the international community will move forward with offering sanctions relief to Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how concerned or not is the White House about this possibility of a lawsuit from House Republicans over the fact that they don\'t have access to the side agreements of the IAEA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it strikes me that this is not a coincidence that what we\'ve taken to calling the Tortilla Coast gambit is something that emerged just hours after it became clear that this resolution of disapproval would not move through the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 Now the House -- again, because of this plan, this gambit -- has decided to abandon that approach and to consider three other pieces of legislation that the Senate has made pretty clear they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to consider.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is a clear difference of opinion in the approach within the Republican Party on Capitol Hill about exactly how to move forward here.\xc2\xa0 But what we feel confident in is that after September 17th, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to spoil this agreement will have expired, and we\'ll be able to move forward with the international community to implement the agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you shed any light on the meeting between U.S. and Israeli officials that Vice President Biden referred to last night?\xc2\xa0 What officials would be involved when this would meet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about that in the days and weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that consultation between U.S. and Israeli officials is something that has been ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And the President reaffirmed in his telephone call with Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple of months ago that the security cooperation between our two countries would continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister himself has described the security cooperation between the Obama administration and the Israeli government as \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented,\xe2\x80\x9d and that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to not just building and maintaining that relationship, but actually strengthening and deepening it.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have not yet received from the Israelis an interest in detailed discussions about deepening that security cooperation relationship, but we stand ready to have it when the Israelis are.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific meetings to tell you about right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that he just gave after meeting with veterans and the mothers of veterans, he said that he wanted people to realize -- as we enter into the next political cycle, to listen to the veterans, to realize that military actions have consequences, and he\xe2\x80\x99s speaking about their support for the Iran deal, using diplomacy over military actions. Who is he speaking to specifically?\xc2\xa0 Is this a reaction to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s rally on the Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is referring to the broader debate that I think we can expect will take place in the context of the presidential election about the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, and the most effective way to use all of the elements of American power to advance our interests around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has remarked on a number of occasions that he\xe2\x80\x99s not been reluctant to use American military power.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of occasions where he\xe2\x80\x99s used that capability very effectively to advance our interests.\xc2\xa0 He also recognizes that there are a variety of tools that we have to advance our interests -- whether that is, to use the Iran example, using our diplomatic influence around the world to unite the international community to confront Iran, to implement economic sanctions -- another tool in our toolbox -- to coordinate those sanctions with the rest of the international community, to compel Iran to come to the negotiating table and agree to do more to limit their nuclear program than any military strike could.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat is an indication -- I guess that is a good illustration of the way the President believes that U.S. authority and influence can be wielded to advance our interests in the most effective way.\xc2\xa0 But this is the subject of an active debate in the context of presidential campaign, and the fact is it should be.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, not everyone agrees with the approach that the President has taken, but the President feels -- has a lot of confidence in the way that he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to use our influence around the world to advance our interests around the world.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate subject of political debate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one he anticipates will occur in the context of the presidential election, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, the Justice Department today issued new guidance in dealing with white-collar crimes, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re wondering now is why is this being issued so far after the financial crisis, when a lot of these white-collar suits came up, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s passed the statute of limitations to really go after more senior-level people in these organizations.\xc2\xa0 Why now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julia, I think to answer that question you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, this is a policy that they announced earlier this -- just earlier today. I think what I would make clear is that this is an area that the administration has taken very seriously since 2009, and for good reason.\xc2\xa0 We know that there were concerns about some of the strategies and even behavior of large financial entities on Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw is that some of that risky behavior had deep consequences for not just the U.S. but, in fact, the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen everything from the Department of Justice conduct more than 60 enforcement actions against financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 They recovered $85 billion for taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 That is separate from the work that was performed by the Obama administration in conjunction with 49 state attorneys general across the country to reach a national mortgage servicing settlement, which provided about $50 billion in relief for consumers.\xc2\xa0 And that does not include the actions that were taken by the CFPB -- this is the independent enforcement agency that was stood up by Wall Street reform, championed by President Obama -- that has provided $10 billion in relief to 17 million consumers across the country who were harmed by illegal practices.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the administration, through the Department of Justice -- through our coordinated efforts with state attorneys general, and through the newly created CFPB -- have taken important steps to protect consumers.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is probably the most important step, however, was the successful passage and implementation of Wall Street reform.\xc2\xa0 This is a piece of legislation that will make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for risky bets that are made by large Wall Street institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but in this plan, the Justice Department says that it\xe2\x80\x99s now going to try to focus on the individuals who have committed a crime rather than the civil cases against companies themselves.\xc2\xa0 Is that an admission that maybe these cases were prosecuted as heartily as they should have been in the past?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to talk to the Department of Justice about that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the record of the administration, and even just the Department of Justice, in recovering more than $85 billion for taxpayers since 2009 is an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite aggressive.\xc2\xa0 But again, for the explanation for the policy change, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We, again today, heard Republican leadership say they don\xe2\x80\x99t want a shutdown to happen.\xc2\xa0 What kind of confidence do you have in the leadership at this point that they can actually avert that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see leaders in Congress accept the invitation from Democrats in Congress to try to negotiate a bipartisan agreement on the budget.\xc2\xa0 If Republican leaders maintain their insistence on trying to pass a budget along party lines, then we are going to be headed for a shutdown, because it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been paying attention over the last several months that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the votes to pass a budget and that will result in a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe way to avoid that is for Democrats and Republicans to do what they did two years ago, which is finally sit down and try to work in bipartisan fashion to negotiate the kind of budget agreement that neither side would think is perfect, but that both sides would acknowledge are in the best interests of the United States and our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration would certainly participate in that process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting on the side of the table as the congressional Democrats there because we share their values and priorities.\xc2\xa0 But surely we can find some common ground in the way that Paul Ryan and Patty Murray did two years ago, and we believe that they should do that again.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, the risk of a shutdown looms larger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t sound very optimistic that it can be avoided.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I take heart in the comments of the Republican leaders in Congress about their goal of preventing a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly pleased to hear them acknowledge that that would not be in the best interest of our economy and it certainly would undermine many of the priorities that all Americans share.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut at the same time, the administration, and I think the American people, will judge the Republican leaders by their actions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing for them to say they don\xe2\x80\x99t want a government shutdown; it\xe2\x80\x99s yet another thing for them to say they won\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to Democrats to figure out how to avoid it.\xc2\xa0 But yet, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s taken place for so long.\xc2\xa0 And there is concern that we now stand just three weeks before the end of the fiscal year and despite an open invitation that was extended months ago, Republicans have refused to negotiate with Democrats.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not in the best interest of the country, and it does make the likelihood of a shutdown bigger than it should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a point at which the administration prepares for a shutdown?\xc2\xa0 Are agencies actually actively preparing for that as we speak?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is a process for this, unfortunately, and my colleagues at the Office of Management and Budget can describe that process to you.\xc2\xa0 There have been a couple of occasions over the last six years where, because of congressional inaction, the federal government has come perilously close to shutting down, and there\xe2\x80\x99s been even one instance a couple years ago where that occurred.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a regular process for agencies to prepare.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if those preparations have begun or not, but my colleagues at the Office of Management and Budget can fill you in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just quickly on the Syrian refugee question. Yesterday, on the background call, it was announced basically that the recommendation is that more numbers will be taken in, but there was no number given or even an approximate number.\xc2\xa0 But then it was also said that the plan all along was to take in more Syrian refugees.\xc2\xa0 So, again, what really has changed?\xc2\xa0 And why not mention a number at this point?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me answer your question this way, Michelle.\xc2\xa0 The United States, at the direction of the President of the United States, has played a leading role in addressing the dire humanitarian crisis in the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 And the best evidence I can direct you toward is the $4 billion in financial assistance that the United States has provided to relief agencies and others who are trying to meet the humanitarian needs of those who are fleeing violence in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat makes the United States the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance in the world.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the United States leading the way.\xc2\xa0 This kind of financial assistance is by far the most effective way for us to meet this urgent humanitarian need.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, the President has directed his team to consider how we can further scale up our response.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that the United States can do is to begin to admit more Syrian refugees into the United States.\xc2\xa0 This year, the fiscal year that will end at the end of this month, the United States is on track to take in about 1,500 Syrian refugees.\xc2\xa0 The President has directed his team to scale up that number next year.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s informed his team that he would like them to accept -- at least make preparations to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next fiscal year.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we know the scale of this problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s significant.\xc2\xa0 And there are millions of people who have been driven from their homes because of this violence.\xc2\xa0 We know that it certainly is not feasible for millions of Syrians to come to this country.\xc2\xa0 But what we can do is make sure that we are doing everything we can to try to provide for their basic needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has continue to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve offered that assistance to organizations that are serving the needs of Syrians inside of Syria who have been displaced.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also providing financial assistance to organizations that have set up refugee camps in places like Turkey and Lebanon and in Jordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States will continue to use our influence to encourage other countries both in the region and around the world -- even people who are not -- even countries who are not traditional donors to those kinds of efforts -- to ramp up their participation.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is indicative of the longstanding commitment that the United States has, when confronted with a significant international crisis, to play a leading role in solving it.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, this situation will not be resolved until we can resolve the political crisis inside of Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what is fomenting the violence.\xc2\xa0 That instability is ultimately the responsibility of President Assad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you arrive at that number?\xc2\xa0 And when you see Britain changing course and saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to admit 20,000 now -- the U.S. is a lot larger than Britain.\xc2\xa0 How do you sort of make that comparison when you look at what Europe is doing, you look at what other countries are doing?\xc2\xa0 Where does that number come from?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what it reflects is a significant scaling up of the commitment on the part of the United States to accept more Syrian refugees into this country.\xc2\xa0 However -- and again, this is what our experts tell us and I also think this is what common sense tells us -- that the solution here is to meet\xc2\xa0 -- the most urgent, immediate need of Syrian refugees is to make sure that we can provide basic medical care, basic shelter, basic food and water, and even some other things like internationally run schools in these refugee camps to try to provide for the basic needs of those Syrians that have been forced from their homes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet the urgent need.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to recognize -- and I mentioned this earlier this week, as well -- the top concern or the top priority when evaluating these kinds of policy options is the safety and security of the United States and our citizens.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that refugees go through the most robust security process of anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s contemplating travel to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Refugees have to be screened by the National Counterterrorism Center, by the FBI Terrorist Screening Center.\xc2\xa0 They go through databases that are maintained by DHS, the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 There is biographical and biometric information that is collected about these individuals.\xc2\xa0 They have to submit to in-person interviews to discuss their case.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that process typically takes 12 to 18 months.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that process is that the safety and security of the U.S. homeland comes first.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s another reason why the best way to address this urgent need is to try to ramp up our humanitarian assistance in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, the vast majority of those who have fled the violence in Syria are hoping that there will be a situation where one day they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to return.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why you see so many of them seek shelter in other parts of the country or in other parts of the region, because they have the hope of returning.\xc2\xa0 And that is clearly in the best interest of those refugees, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of those countries right now that are bearing a significant burden of trying to meet their basic humanitarian needs.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the United States, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks so much, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up with a couple points on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, the 10,000 figure, is that inside, the overall, global cap of 75,000 that Secretary Kerry was talking about on the Hill yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the Secretary indicated in his conversations on the Hill yesterday is that the State Department has been contemplating for some time, even before this latest crisis emerged, raising the caps on the number of refugees that are accepted into this country.\xc2\xa0 And so that overall number is something that the State Department is continuing to work on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But what I\'m getting at is the 10,000 -- that could be in addition to the global -- if it\'s inside the 75,000 and you\'re taking 10,000 more Syrians, you\'re taking thousands fewer of other refugees, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the 75 number is one that I recognize has been widely reported, and what I would say to you is that we have indicated that we\'re looking to increase the number beyond 70,000, which is the approximate number that is likely to be taken in by the end of this year, which is the end of this month. So these are all numbers that are being worked through by the State Department, and so once those numbers are resolved I\'ll be able to talk to you in some detail about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But inside the overall number -- will these be additional Syrians that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just spoken about that will be coming at the expense of other categories of people who are regularly allowed to be admitted as refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s unclear at this point exactly what impact this will have on the specific caps.\xc2\xa0 What we do know is that the overall cap and the cap as it relates to Syrian refugees is going up next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more -- a clarification.\xc2\xa0 Chuck Grassley, after speaking -- or given the briefing by Secretary Kerry yesterday, was saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s concerned that the administration is looking at additional emergency admissions of Syrians and other refugees. Is this what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about?\xc2\xa0 I mean, should we call this an emergency special admission, or is this just part of the regular process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not quite sure what Senator Grassley may have been referring to.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that this is an effort that the President has directed to scale up our response to the Syrian refugee crisis.\xc2\xa0 And it does not, however, reflect the intent by the administration to cut any corners when it comes to the security protocols that are in place prior to any refugee traveling to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- and you may not have worked this through yet -- but how do you contemplate dealing with this processing of the refugees?\xc2\xa0 Would that be done at the refugee camp level?\xc2\xa0 And would you say, if you want to come to America, don\'t try any transit across the Mediterranean, please don\'t go to Europe, stay where you are and we\'ll do the processing there -- is that how you contemplate this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that the way that individuals can get the kind of refugee status that would allow them to qualify for a resettlement program like the one that I was describing earlier is something that is coordinated principally by the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 And this is a program that, frankly, represents a rather small percentage of the large number of people who have been displaced by the violence.\xc2\xa0 But this is a program that is in place to deal with migration crises around the globe.\xc2\xa0 And when you take a look at that specific program, you get another illustration of American leadership.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe this was mentioned on the call that Michelle referred to yesterday as well.\xc2\xa0 The United States, through that program, actually takes in more refugees to be resettled inside the United States than every other country in the world combined. So, again, the U.S. track record when it comes to trying to meet the humanitarian needs of displaced peoples is quite strong.\xc2\xa0 But in the face of this significant crisis, the President is pushing his national security team to scale it up even further.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are several considerations, and at this particular moment, people are listening to the words from the White House probably more carefully on this than they would, let\xe2\x80\x99s say, two or three months ago.\xc2\xa0 So is the message from the administration, don\'t leave the refugee camps if you want to come to America; your best chance if that\'s where you want to go is to stay where you are and not seek passage to Europe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the way that -- we\'ve been through a similar situation before, as recently as last summer.\xc2\xa0 And it is never a good idea for people to entrust themselves or their loved ones to a human trafficker or somebody who claims that they can get them into the United States.\xc2\xa0 That\'s never a strategy for success and it is not worth the dangerous risk associated with that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\'ve previously complimented the commitment of our European allies and partners to crack down on those who are trying to prey on these people who are in an obviously very vulnerable situation, making promises that, quite frankly, those human traffickers can\'t keep.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo from that standpoint, we certainly would not encourage anybody to make a journey like that.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding about the way that this process works to qualify for this refugee settlement program is it is a program that is operated through the United Nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it seems clear that because this processing is time-consuming, though you may increase the cap for Syrians, 10,000 may not qualify in the next fiscal year -- you would acknowledge that, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number who are already in the pipeline who are waiting to be resettled in the United States going through the process --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you anticipate being brought in by the end of this fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 So what are you trying to tell us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\'m trying to tell you is that there are people who right now are in --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have almost 10,000 in the pipeline, I guess is what I\'m trying to get at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that may be true, but -- I don\'t know how many are in the pipeline.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m trying to say is this:\xc2\xa0 You\'re right that it takes 12 to 18 months, typically, to go through this process, so it is possible that somebody who applies today and may otherwise be part of that 10,000 group may not have made their way through this process.\xc2\xa0 However, I don\'t anticipate at this point that we would have a significant problem in trying to meet the ambitious goal that the President has laid out for admitting 10,000 Syrian refugees next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess to simplify it, if there is someone -- and there very well may be many in these refugee camps -- this does not significantly widen their opportunity of coming to America as a refugee, does it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, given the scale of the problem, I would acknowledge that the most effective response to this urgent humanitarian situation is for the international community to ramp up our humanitarian efforts in the region and even in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The United States is the largest donor of those efforts, and we\'re going to use our influence to continue to encourage countries in the region and around the world to scale up the amount of assistance that they\xe2\x80\x99re providing to those ongoing humanitarian efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\'s clear there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant need.\xc2\xa0 And there are some anecdotal evidence to indicate that because -- that many of these camps are starting to reach capacity.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why you\'re starting to see people whose needs are not being met in these areas now considering traveling even further to places like Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Iran deal, setting aside its geographical origins of the lawsuit, you were asked to describe what the administration believes about its merits.\xc2\xa0 You skipped over that part.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to ask you again, what does the administration believe are any -- if any legal merits exist with the concept of using litigation to either slow or block implementation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my sense, Major, is that this obviously is not the first time we\'ve seen Republicans who are unsuccessful in trying to prevent the President from doing something using their official duties as a member of Congress resort in desperation to a piece of litigation.\xc2\xa0 We haven\'t seen any documents to be filed by House Republicans, so I think it would be premature to comment on it at this point.\xc2\xa0 But this is a strategy that Republicans have tried before, and it\'s always something they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried, frankly, out of desperation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a question about Iran.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your answer to Republicans who say that these secret side agreements have not been sent to Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is it that you feel that you -- that you have sent them, or the ones they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about are not covered by the agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve been very clear that the documentation that Congress needs to evaluate this agreement was provided to them on July *17th 19th, and we\'ve been clear that that documentation included all of the documentation that was in the possession of the United States government and it had been provided to Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe believe that that is ample information for members of Congress to evaluate this agreement.\xc2\xa0 But we have gone above and beyond that by convening large classified briefings, by sending senior administration officials to participate in committee hearings and to offer committee testimony under oath, to say nothing of the hundreds -- literally hundreds of meetings and conversations and briefings that have been provided by the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, and a whole host of senior national security officials to members of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis also included briefings by the individuals who were responsible for negotiating the agreement, people who have the best firsthand knowledge of what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement.\xc2\xa0 Those briefings also included classified conversations about the substance of the agreement between Iran and the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that even today there are classified briefings being held for members of Congress about the contents of that agreement.\xc2\xa0 So if there\xe2\x80\x99s any member of Congress that says, well, I would like to know what\xe2\x80\x99s in that agreement, they can contact the administration and, in an appropriate, classified setting, can be briefed on the contents of that agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to the extent they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the secret side agreement between the IAEA and Iran, you\'re saying that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed on that, they just haven\'t been handed the actual thing itself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t been handed the actual document because it is an IAEA document that reflects an agreement between the IAEA and Iran.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no mystery to at least members of Congress with a security clearance about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in that agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 If the goal is ultimately to return the Syrian refugees home, does that require the President to do something more or new in Syria to change Syria policy, given the current stalemate there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, it certainly does mean that the political failure that was caused by the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has been a leading advocate of the efforts led by the U.N. to try to facilitate a political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of meetings, even a couple of high-profile meetings where the U.N. tried to broker a political settlement.\xc2\xa0 Those efforts have thus far not yielded any fruit.\xc2\xa0 But the United States continues to be strongly supportive of that ongoing effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you some Hillary Clinton questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If I say no, you probably will so --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Probably do it anyway.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In her interview with ABC this week, which I\'m sure you caught, she apologized to the American people.\xc2\xa0 Is it the view of the White House she has anything to apologize for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as it relates to her decision to apologize, I\'d encourage you to contact the campaign.\xc2\xa0 She can speak for herself when it comes to her own views about what exactly she needed to apologize for.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll let her do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is she getting special treatment -- if another federal employee, one her at the White House or one at the State Department, acknowledging that the IT rules are different, did what she did -- ran his or her own personal server -- would that person still have a job?\xc2\xa0 Would that person be employed?\xc2\xa0 Would that person be in violation of -- is she getting special treatment for being able to run her own server?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bryon, I think it is pretty clear that she\xe2\x80\x99s getting special treatment from Republicans in the Congress. And this is a group of Republicans that originally put together a committee to investigate the terrible tragedy in Benghazi -- the eighth committee that was formed.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been unable to explain thus far exactly how this is directly related to their ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 It is clear to see how it\'s directly related to their political motivation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, it\'s hard for me to comment on a hypothetical other than to observe that it does appear that Congress has extended Secretary Clinton some special treatment, as you described.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, could you talk to us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s, I guess, push, renewed push when it comes to criminal justice and the CDC in his speech -- and beyond that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I am not in a position to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks for that annual event.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that criminal justice reform is a priority of the administration.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that there does appear to be an opportunity to capitalize on some bipartisan common ground to advance that goal, and the President is very interested in trying to make the most of that opportunity.\xc2\xa0 There have already been a number of meetings that have been convened here at the White House with Democrats and Republicans who are interested in this issue, and now that Congress has returned from their August recess, I would anticipate that there will be more such meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are the most pressing pieces that he wants to see passed this fall when it comes to criminal justice?\xc2\xa0 And also, what do you say about the strange bedfellows that you have for this?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have people that have been -- vehemently fought against this administration and this President, and now they are in lockstep on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re highlighting that the -- an opportunity like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come around very often, and it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t come around very often in the last four and a half years since Republicans took the majority in the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0 So the President is hoping that he can make the most of it.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about quite a bit throughout his career, even before he became President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So this is an issue that he feels strongly about, and he feels that this is an issue that could have a significant impact on our country.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s pleased to see that there are people who don\xe2\x80\x99t routinely agree with him on much of anything actually indicating that they agree with him on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Koch brothers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, including them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And also, again, going back to the question I had, what specifically really does the President want to see out of all of this?\xc2\xa0 What are the key pieces that he would like to see out of the legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s going through Congress right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, we\xe2\x80\x99re still engaged in conversations with members of Congress about where their priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate as we get further down the line in having these conversations and trying to identify exactly where common ground exists, we can talk in more specific detail about what those goals actually are.</p>\n<p>\n\tJames.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just a few subjects.\xc2\xa0 First, on the Syrian refugees, Senator McCain gave an impassioned floor speech in which he stated that the correct way to describe these individuals is \xe2\x80\x9crefugees\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cmigrants.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, refugee is a specific term of art, as I described before.\xc2\xa0 So the fact is these are human beings who are in a terrible, desperate, vulnerable situation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has directed his national security team to continue to play a leading role in our response to this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has always, throughout his political career, cast himself as a champion of the oppressed, of the disenfranchised.\xc2\xa0 As you acknowledged, the scale of this problem in Syria is such that the admission of even 10,000 of these refugees amounts basically to a drop in the bucket.\xc2\xa0 What happened to the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles of really helping the dispossessed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 James, the President believes that the best way for us to assist the millions of people that have been affected by this violence is to continue to serve as the largest supporter of ongoing efforts to try to meet their basic humanitarian needs.\xc2\xa0 And that includes humanitarian efforts that are underway inside of Syria but also throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the ongoing saga of Mrs. Clinton and her emails, as one of my colleagues just noted, in an interview with ABC News this week, former Secretary Clinton apologized, presumably not just in her interview to the American people for the way she handled classified information on that email account and on that server.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama believe that Mrs. Clinton owes him, her boss, an apology for the way she handled classified information?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think that he has asked or sought anything like that.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, Secretary Clinton was speaking about her own views and her own feelings about exactly what had happened.\xc2\xa0 And she made those views know, and clearly that\'s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President regard that it was appropriate for her to apologize as she did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He believes that was entirely her decision to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On her Facebook page, Mrs. Clinton stated -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cMy use of a personal email account was above board.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 She added, \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone I communicated with in government was aware of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You have previously confirmed from the podium that President Obama and Secretary Clinton exchanged some number of emails with the Secretary using that private address.\xc2\xa0 Is she accurate when she says everyone she communicated with in government was aware of that private address, and that would include the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, I\'ve acknowledged before that I think most people who are trading emails with someone are aware of that other person\xe2\x80\x99s email address.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m not surprised to hear that the President was aware of what her email address was because he traded emails with her.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But previously, the President told my CBS News colleague, Bill Plante that he became aware of this only when everyone else did.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, now you\'re asking me about the email server situation.\xc2\xa0 And I think most people, myself included, are aware of the email address of many people, but I\'m not aware, for example, of what the arrangement is that Fox News has set up for Fox News email addresses.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 email system is not at issue here.\xc2\xa0 I think you understand that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that to be true.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the point I\'m trying to make here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To your knowledge, at any point in his presidency, did President Obama remarks to any other aide about Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use of a private email address?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last subject.\xc2\xa0 In an NPR debate in 2007, then Senator Obama, campaigning for the White House, complained about the way that, as he put it, President Bush and Vice President Cheney manipulated the intelligence to the Iraq war concerning WMD.\xc2\xa0 Putting aside the conclusion of the Robb-Silberman panel, which found that there was not a single instance of such manipulation, I wonder what the President makes of the recent Daily Beast report, which alleges that several dozen line analysts in the Defense Department have signed their names to a formal complaint that their intelligence on the conflict with ISIS is being sanitized and distorted and manipulated as it makes its way up to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, James, I\'m reluctant to comment on I think what has been publicly acknowledged as part of an ongoing investigation.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that what the President has repeatedly sought from his national security team is the clearest and best assessment of what exactly is happening on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President routinely asks for, and that\'s what the President has confidence that he is routinely provided by his national security team.\xc2\xa0 The kinds of very difficult decisions that any President is responsible for making on a daily basis relies on good information, and that\'s exactly what the President seeks, particularly when he\xe2\x80\x99s dealing with a situation as complicated as our efforts to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to him about this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Tuesday, the State Department named a transparency coordinator.\xc2\xa0 Can you say who does that job here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there is anybody who specifically has that responsibility here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think that\xe2\x80\x99s a job that would be worthwhile to assign here at the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess off the top of my head I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what that person would do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, their transparency requests that aren\xe2\x80\x99t being met.\xc2\xa0 Who do we go to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You can certainly come to me or anybody in my office and we -- I think I have a pretty good record of not resolving all of those concerns, but many of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And on Monday, the President said that he\xe2\x80\x99s so glad that his name is not on any ballot.\xc2\xa0 Is that more a reflection of the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s view, or is it really his view?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Both.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both.\xc2\xa0 If there were no 22nd Amendment, do you think he\xe2\x80\x99d want to run again?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President made a pretty robust case, and even in some ways a personal explanation in his speech before the African Union about the benefits of limiting American Presidents to two terms.\xc2\xa0 The President I think spoke very clearly, and many of you all made note of the fact that he felt that if he made the decision to run and that were allowed by our Constitution, that he\xe2\x80\x99d win.\xc2\xa0 But the President also observed that there is a benefit to having some new blood in the job and some fresh thinking, and somebody who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been sort of maintaining the kind of punishing pace that any President has to maintain, and that somebody who can come in with some fresher legs often serves the country well.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, our system has benefited from that over the years.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the President is very proud of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to accomplish over the last six and a half years.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be pleased with everything that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have done over the last eight.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think that he\xe2\x80\x99ll acknowledge that it will be somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s turn to take over that office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate to say that he likes being President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been paying attention, particularly over the last nine months or so, would observe that he seems to be having a pretty good time.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Let me address someone who is running for President -- Donald Trump, who now is 30 percent in one national poll, yesterday got a lot of applause when he said not once but twice in the anti-Iran rally that we are led by \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very stupid people.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You prepared long and hard for that, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to the refugee crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about the 10,000 number.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi said that -- pointed out, as other people have, that in Vietnam we did 14,000 a month, and she said that was important for setting the bar for the rest of the world.\xc2\xa0 Other people have pointed out that we had an expedited process during the Iraq war and brought about 50,000 refugees in during that time.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear that the President thinks that the better way is the $4 billion and the kind of funding that has support refugee programs in the region of Syria.\xc2\xa0 Why the difference in approach than we had either in Vietnam or Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I would try to illustrate is that given the scale of the population that\xe2\x80\x99s been displaced by this violence in Syria, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine a practical solution that includes bringing all those people to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Nancy Pelosi is suggesting that everybody be brought back -- that everybody be brought to the United States, any more than those senators that we talked about who wrote the letter three months ago were suggesting that the United States accept everyone.\xc2\xa0 But maybe just setting a significant number that, as she put it, \xe2\x80\x9csets the bar.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is that to scale up to a degree that some members of Congress may have in mind would have some significant fiscal consequences.\xc2\xa0 The kind of -- the background check process that I described before is work-intensive and requires a lot of trained manpower.\xc2\xa0 And so Congress would need to make a significant financial commitment to ramping up along those lines.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I would say is that Congress can certainly enhance the response by acting on the eminently qualified woman that the President has appointed to be the -- or has nominated to be the next head of the USAID.\xc2\xa0 This is the agency, after all, that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for directing so much of that humanitarian relief, and for months now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Senate be slow to act on her nomination despite the fact that she\xe2\x80\x99s got strong bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for those who continue to be concerned about the situation of so many of these people that are in a vulnerable state, we would encourage Congress to put the nomination of Gayle Smith on their to-do list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also wanted to ask you about -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you know this, but is there any consideration being given to trying to find an expedited process the way they did during Iraq? Or is there too much of a concern, as even James Clapper has pointed out, about potential infiltration of ISIS, of other terrorists into refugees who are coming into this country, which has also been a concern expressed by some Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At every step of the way, the President and his national security team will put the safety and security of the U.S. homeland at the top of the list.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point have any announcements to make about shortening that timeframe or shortening that process.\xc2\xa0 But I do feel confident in telling you that the President will not sign off on a process that cuts corners when it comes to the basic safety and security of the American people and the U.S. homeland.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, this week Hillary Clinton said that she would have a litmus test for new appointees to the Supreme Court if she were elected President on the Citizens United case.\xc2\xa0 The President has said Citizens United would be -- is a bad result from the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 If an opening comes up in the next year and a half while he\xe2\x80\x99s still President, would he use a similar litmus test for someone he would appoint to the bench?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate at this point on what process the President would use to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Almost every major Democratic candidate for President for the 2016 nomination has said something similar about Citizens United.\xc2\xa0 Is the President playing catch-up with where the party is going on this issue?\xc2\xa0 Is he not willing to go and to lead on this as the head of the party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Jared, the President has been speaking out on this topic for years now, and I think quite famously had an interaction with a Supreme Court justice when discussing this particular care and raising his concerns about the impact it would have -- the negative impact it would have on our political system.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this are well known and have been for quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to appointing justices or considering appointments to the bench, is that the next President\xe2\x80\x99s problem?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear to me that there will be a Supreme Court vacancy.\xc2\xa0 But if there is, we can probably have a more fruitful discussion about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the question about, I mean, litmus tests is not completely -- I mean, it is hypothetical, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not out of the ordinary for Presidents and presidential candidates to discuss.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we don\xe2\x80\x99t have conversations like this all the time about abortion and other major issues, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like this is out of the realm of possibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on a litmus test that the President may or may not use for a Supreme Court vacancy that may or may not open up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader said yesterday that there would be no talk with the U.S. outside the nuclear negotiation -- and in his words, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not negotiate with them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Some families of the Americans held over there found that quite ominous.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get your reaction to those words, and does it complicate -- does it end the talks that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said are ongoing for those -- to get those Americans back?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Devon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update to provide you on our ongoing efforts to try to secure the release of those Americans who are being unjustly detained in Iran other than to tell you that those efforts are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And the President, I think in the variety of settings in which he\xe2\x80\x99s had the opportunity to speak about the plight of those Americans, I think has made quite clear that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a priority of the United States government to secure their release, it\xe2\x80\x99s a personal priority of the President of the United States to secure their release.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do everything that we can to try to secure their release.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t be the first.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many questions today.\xc2\xa0 In an interview earlier this year, the President said of Mrs. Clinton, \xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s her wonderful self, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99s going to do great in the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 A number of new polls out now showing she\xe2\x80\x99s having a hard time specifically in Iowa and New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that voters are getting to see her \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful self\xe2\x80\x9d up there as she campaigns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President -- I think his initial observation about this would be that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the polls here a little over a year before the general election are certainly better than the kind of poll numbers he had a little more than a year before the general election in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And so I think at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s far too early to make judgments about how this process will end.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some daylight between the President and the Secretary of State on the numbers?\xc2\xa0 Because, of course, when the Secretary of State went up to Capitol Hill, our understanding is that in some of these conversations, he discussed raising the bar for the number of people next year to as much as 100,000, which would require -- if you continue with your very strong vetting process -- significant hiring of a lot more people.\xc2\xa0 Are the President and the Secretary of State in agreement about the need and how to meet that need?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are.\xc2\xa0 I think where the breach might be between -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say this in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get me in trouble.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really need this fight today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s almost too late to stop now, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you used the word \xe2\x80\x9cbreach\xe2\x80\x9d -- keep on going.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 Let me just say it this way.\xc2\xa0 I think that there may have been some members of Congress who may have been anonymous sources for your reporters who may have misunderstood the message delivered by the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary of State is in complete alignment with the President when it comes to our refugee policy and the direction that the President has given to the Secretary of State to begin to ramp up those numbers, particularly as it relates to those fleeing violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, the prospect of an increase from 70,000 this fiscal year that\xe2\x80\x99s just about to end, and ramping it up to 100,000 in the next fiscal year seems quite ambitious and probably not possible without a significant commitment of additional resources by Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99d be a little skeptical of suggestions that were made by some in Congress that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Secretary was advocating for.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was advocating for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is there something different about the Syrian refugee crisis?\xc2\xa0 As was noted before, the United States has taken in tens of thousands of refugees on a monthly basis before.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve waived a lot of these difficult vetting process before in the face of a massive humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen not to do that this time.\xc2\xa0 These refugees are flowing into Europe.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not getting vetted at the Austrian border there.\xc2\xa0 Germany is taking in 800,000 this year.\xc2\xa0 Is this the way it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be forever on that all refugee crises are still going to have to go through this very narrow pipe in the United States?\xc2\xa0 Or is there something about Syria in particular that raises security concerns in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you raise the prospect of -- or the challenge that\xe2\x80\x99s facing Germany right now.\xc2\xa0 I think we first have to acknowledge that the German government and even the German people are demonstrating tremendous generosity and hospitality to these fellow human beings who are in a desperate situation and are particularly vulnerable right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a credit to the German government and to the German people.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that many of these migrants or refugees are showing up at train stations in Germany.\xc2\xa0 And they are facing a much more direct and significant burden that they have to bear.\xc2\xa0 So the question becomes, how do we all do our part?\xc2\xa0 And as the most influential, powerful nation in the world, how can the United States do our part to try to assist in solving this large-scale humanitarian crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the President has done is to direct his team to do as much as we can to try to provide for the basic humanitarian needs of those individuals, whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re in Syria or in the region.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance -- we\xe2\x80\x99re up to $4 billion at this point.\xc2\xa0 And the United States continues to strongly encourage countries in the region and around the world to also contribute to that effort.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has a certain amount of influence that we can bring to bear, and we certainly have set an important example for others to follow.\xc2\xa0 That is the most effective way for us to meet the urgent need of those who have fled Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, I think you could also interpret this policy directive to scale up the number of refugees that are brought to the United States as another example of the President hoping that the international community will follow the example of the United States -- moving from 1,500 Syrian refugees one year to 10,000 in the next does represent a significant scaling up.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned to Major, I would acknowledge readily that the scale of the problem is such that the problem will persist long after those 10,000 or more Syrians have made it into the United States by the end of the next fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to continue to redouble our humanitarian efforts that are underway inside of Syria and around the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, would you -- you described the German response as tremendous generosity and hospitality.\xc2\xa0 Would you describe the U.S. response that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that for years the United States has been the leading donor of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is indicative of the tremendous generosity of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And hospitality?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not offering very many homes to these people.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have significantly scaled up the kind of assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to provide next year.\xc2\xa0 But again, this is about each nation playing their role.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is quite possible that -- well, the challenge that is facing Germany right now is different than the challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99re facing.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is hopeful that we can use the significant benefits with which this country has been blessed to provide humanitarian assistance to those fellow human beings that are in a terribly desperate situation, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to strongly encourage others to follow our example.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department had already said that the goal for the next fiscal year is 5,000 to 8,000 refugees.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t this actually just an increase of 2,000?\xc2\xa0 And what does this mean for those fleeing Iraq and Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I quite get the math on the 5, 8 and 10 thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They already said the goal was for the next fiscal year was a total of 5,000 to 8,000 refugees from Syria.\xc2\xa0 So is this just 2,000 more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding is -- I guess I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve previously said about what they were hoping to do for next year.\xc2\xa0 What we had identified is an opportunity for us to scale up our response and to talk about how the United States could accept more Syrian refugees into this country next year -- and that was a directive from the President of the United States, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re working on.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the State Department will do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you approve of the way the Hungarian government is treating their refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to sort of stand in judgment of individual countries at this point as they deal with what I think we can all acknowledge is a terribly difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that other countries will do what the United States and Germany have done, which is to play an important role in contributing to the response to meeting the needs of millions of people that are in a desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more for you.\xc2\xa0 The Russian foreign minister now acknowledges that the Russian military is conducting some operations in Syria, but he says it\xe2\x80\x99s just part of an ongoing military cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been a couple of conversations between the Secretary of State and his Russian counterpart in the last week -- both last Saturday and again yesterday.\xc2\xa0 In those conversations, Secretary Kerry conveyed to his counterpart that the United States continues to believe that there must urgently be a political solution to the conflict in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And while in general we would welcome constructive Russian contributions to counter ISIL efforts, we would oppose any actions in Syria that would empower the regime to escalate the conflict.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge in Syria right now, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the Russians will find a way to play a constructive effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think the Russians are doing there now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on many occasions, it\xe2\x80\x99s often difficult to clearly assess precisely what their intentions are, but obviously we continue to be in close touch and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear what our position is when it comes to assessing priorities in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do one more.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Bob.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the Iran deal, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re going to disagree with this analogy in a sense, but there\xe2\x80\x99s an expression in sports about a team backing into the playoffs because another team lost.\xc2\xa0 And with having to sustain a filibuster to avoid disapproval from Congress, is the President upset that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to get one Republican onboard with this agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bob, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the administration has been disappointed that an issue so important has been filtered through a partisan lens in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we saw that partisanship rear its ugly head even before this agreement was announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say many times that on the Sunday before the agreement was announced, you had the Speaker of the House, the Republican Leader in the Senate, the Republican Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee all come out against a deal that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been announced.\xc2\xa0 And the President was pretty disappointed by that kind of reaction, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly what the American people sent their members of Congress up here to do.\xc2\xa0 I think what they sent them up here to do is to carefully consider issues like this where the stakes are so high.\xc2\xa0 And we have been gratified that as the days and weeks have gone by, that the more that members of Congress have spent time looking at this agreement that more of them have announced their support for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear when you look at the state of relations between Republicans in the House and Republicans in the Senate and everything from the Donald Trump rally to the Tortilla Coast gambit, it gives you I think a pretty clear indication that momentum is on the side of those who support the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, Bob, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Democrats in the House who are blocking consideration of a resolution of disapproval in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 The resolution of disapproval is not even going to be considered by the House, based on the latest schedule that I saw.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not even a situation where this is particularly close to passing.\xc2\xa0 Right now -- I mean, look, if we were sitting here just a month ago, if you think back to mid-August, and we\xe2\x80\x99d been sort of talking about how things would be resolved in the Congress as it relates to the Iran agreement, and I told you that neither house of Congress would pass a resolution of disapproval for this agreement, you\xe2\x80\x99d be shocked.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the kind of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in this regard.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the fact that the more that people understand about the agreement, the more support we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to build in support of the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not because of a lack of majority disapproval in both of those Houses, would you agree?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is an indication that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficient support in either body of Congress to pass those resolutions of disapproval.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Speaker of the House had to pull the rule from the floor yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, everyone in here was assuming that success for the administration would be one house of Congress successfully sustaining the veto of the President of the United States when, in fact, we\xe2\x80\x99d built enough to support to actually block the passage of a resolution of disapproval in either house of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the amount of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make in building support for this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are your official new numbers on the vote tally?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen one, but they\xe2\x80\x99re starting to hold votes here pretty soon so we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see in black and white.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see the President after the votes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
