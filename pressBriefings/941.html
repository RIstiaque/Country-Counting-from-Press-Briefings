EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard, Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us this morning as we make our way to Tampa Bay, Florida, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the port there.\xc2\xa0 The President will speak about the vital importance of increasing our exports as part of his comprehensive effort to build a strong foundation for America\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will then fly to Cartagena, Colombia where the President will, as you know, participate in the Summit of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re awfully glad to have you onboard today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have with me, Ben Rhodes, deputy national security advisor, who can field your questions on the summit and other matters of foreign policy, national security, relieving me of that duty for the day.\xc2\xa0 I can take your questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk a little bit about the North Korea rocket -- even though it failed, does the fact that they even tried suggest that the President\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to engage North Korea was itself a failure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, what this administration has done is broken the cycle of rewarding provocative actions by the North Koreans that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the previous administration, for instance, there was a substantial amount of assistance provided to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 North Korea was removed from the terrorism list, even as they continued to engage in provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 Under our administration we have not provided any assistance to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 When this new regime took power after the death of Kim Jong-il, we had discussions with them about potentially an agreement where they would freeze their enrichment activities and take some other steps towards denuclearization, and that we as a part of that might provide food assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we also made clear that we could not go forward with that type of agreement if they could not keep their commitments, and their efforts to launch a missile clearly demonstrates that they could not be trusted to keep their commitments.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going forward with an agreement to provide them with any assistance.\xc2\xa0 We have not provided them with any assistance, and it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to see how we can move forward with the February agreement given the action that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is notable that we\xe2\x80\x99ve also put the most unprecedented sanctions in place against the North Koreans that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen to date.\xc2\xa0 Those sanctions target in part their proliferation activities, their ballistic missile capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And again, what we saw yesterday was a launch that did not meet its objective and that failed shortly after takeoff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s next?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, today we will -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, first of all, universal condemnation of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s provocative action, including the United States and our allies -- South Korea and Japan, but also including China and Russia.\xc2\xa0 And today, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin consultations about -- at the U.N. Security Council about how to deliver a message to the North Koreans that the international community rejects this launch and is prepared to take additional steps, particularly if North Korea continues to go down the road of taking provocative actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would those additional steps be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we already have the very tough sanctions regime in place.\xc2\xa0 I think the North Koreans have to hear a universal message of condemnation from the international community.\xc2\xa0 They have to understand that they will only deepen their isolation by going down this road.\xc2\xa0 They have to understand from us that any agreement would be impossible to move forward with as it relates to food assistance, given the action that they have taken.\xc2\xa0 So there are already consequences as a result of their missile launch.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf they continue to take additional provocative actions, we, of course, have to continue to look at ways in which we could tighten sanctions on the North Koreans and take additional steps to apply pressure on the regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about a nuclear launch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 In the past, the North Koreans have tended to pursue patterns of provocative actions to include missile launches, nuclear tests as they undertook in 2006, 2009.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly concerned about the pattern of provocative behavior that the North Koreans engage in.\xc2\xa0 What we want to make clear to them is that each step that they take in terms of provocations will only lead to a deeper isolation, increase consequences.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that\'s not just a message they\'re hearing from us, they\'re hearing it from the Chinese and the Russians as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does North Korea need food aid --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, and the message that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been delivering is that North Korea is wasting its money on these weapons as many of their people starve and as their economy is one of the most backward in the world.\xc2\xa0 What they could have is a better relationship with the international community that allows them to receive assistance, allows their people to have -- live a better life.\xc2\xa0 Instead, they\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen to waste money on missile technologies and provocative actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd frankly, as we saw yesterday, have not even been able to advance that capability.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the better choice for the North Korean people would be for their government to stop this type of provocative behavior and to engage the international community in a way that gives us confidence that they\'re going to abandon their nuclear weapons program and their ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben -- the North Korean people are really being held hostage in this situation.\xc2\xa0 We send food aid to regimes in places all over the world where we have profound disagreements with those governments.\xc2\xa0 Why is it that we feel appropriate here to use food aid as a lever to try to get the government to do what we want?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I actually -- the reason why is because we cannot trust the government to provide that assistance to the people who need it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the North Korean government that is holding its own people hostage because, frankly, we can\'t trust them to implement an agreement and to make sure that the assistance gets to those who need it if they show that they\'re willing to spend their own resources in the pursuit of a ballistic missile program, and that they\'re not going to live up to the agreements that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 So if we can\'t trust the North Korea government to honor its own commitments, we cannot have the confidence that we need that that agreement would be implemented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely true that the North Korean people are the ones who\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered, and the North Korea government is trying to put on this propaganda show over the course of the last several days, inviting journalists in to take a look at this particular rocket launch.\xc2\xa0 Again, what they haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- is the fact that they have an economy that is desperately in need of integration with the world and that they have people, again, who would be far better off if the government spent their resources on investing in North Korean citizenry and not on these types of technologies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Iran -- talks tomorrow, what do you expect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the talks that are going forward is a positive sign.\xc2\xa0 They provide an opportunity for the international community to being to have a discussion with the Iranian government about how they can live up to their obligations and demonstrate the peaceful intent of their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think nobody expects to resolve all differences in one meeting, but what we want is a positive environment where the Iranian government demonstrates its seriousness and its commitment to pursuing serious negotiations with the P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 I think what they\xe2\x80\x99ll find is the P5-plus-1 is incredibly unified in support of both the need for Iran to meet its obligations and the sanctions that we put in place.\xc2\xa0 But we want to begin with a negotiation that can address our concerns about their nuclear program, and we want that negotiation to move forward with a sense of urgency.\xc2\xa0 Because as the President has said, we do believe there\xe2\x80\x99s time and space for diplomacy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not unlimited.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a good first step to begin those discussions and to create an environment where we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing in a serious way with the North Korean -- with the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm talks in May in Baghdad on Iran -- Iran also?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that one of the -- one of the issues that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing in the meeting is what\xe2\x80\x99s the initial negotiations going forward, both in terms of future meetings and venues.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s certainly one venue that\'s been discussed -- Baghdad -- as a potential future venue.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the type of thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to discuss in this -- as we chart out the way forward for these negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, what we want to see is all parties coming to the table in a serious way, bringing forward their ideas for how Iran can convince the international community of the peaceful nature of its program and come in line with its obligations.\xc2\xa0 It would be a positive step forward to see those negotiations continue, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to, again, feed back to the negotiations in December.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one, Russia is suggesting this morning that the P5-plus-1 should offer economic incentives to Iran, at least an agreement.\xc2\xa0 What does the U.S. think of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to see if what the Iranians are prepared to do.\xc2\xa0 The onus is on them to come in line with their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 They\'re the ones who are in violation of their international commitments.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to hear from the Iranians how they can build the confidence of the international community and take steps to live up to those obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf they do, we would certainly explore reciprocal actions that are responsive to concrete steps by the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 But again, we believe that the onus is on the Iranian government to demonstrate its seriousness as it goes into this process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready to reciprocate steps that they take, but again we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see actions, not just words from the Iranian government, given the fact that they are the ones who are outside of their obligations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd frankly, we have sanctions that are coming in place now that are increasing the consequences to the Iranians for their behavior and those sanctions are poised to get a lot tighter and a lot stronger over the course of the spring and summer, so that\xe2\x80\x99s an additional context of these talks that we believe brings additional pressure to bear on the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, can you comment on the reaction of the regime to the thousands of protestors that went to the streets today to kind of test the ceasefire?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we see some progress in terms of a reduction in violence in Syria; however, the Annan plan has different components that we do not see the regime fulfilling at this point.\xc2\xa0 They need to pull their forces out of these cities.\xc2\xa0 They need to respect the right of peaceful protest across Syria.\xc2\xa0 They need to provide for humanitarian access.\xc2\xa0 And they need to demonstrate a commitment to a political transition that\xe2\x80\x99s responsive in the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there has been positive progress made in terms of a dramatic reduction -- or a notable reduction, I\xe2\x80\x99d say, in the levels of violence in Syria, but again there\xe2\x80\x99s far more that needs to be done to make sure that Kofi Annan\xe2\x80\x99s plan is fully implemented.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the position of the United States and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working at the United Nations to support, which is the full completion of all six points of the Kofi Annan plan; and a respect for the right of those Syrians who are protesting today do so peacefully without risk of violence at the hands of their government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything new on whether the President will be making any announcements on implementation of Colombian FTA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still working.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of progress so we remain committed, of course, and we\xe2\x80\x99re moving forward in supporting the Colombian government as they take on their labor action plan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we can resolve all those issues in the near-term future, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you updated if that process is completed in the days ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI should just add one thing as a preview to Tampa -- we are announcing this small business initiative.\xc2\xa0 Just a little background on that -- what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the last two years is a significant increase in U.S. exports to the Americas -- over 40 percent increase since 2009.\xc2\xa0 The biggest job creation, in terms of exports, comes from small business.\xc2\xa0 Yet a lot of our export infrastructure in the past has been focused on bigger exporters.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve done as an administration is try to prioritize increasingly small, medium-sized businesses because they create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And frankly even in the Americas, as we see the growth of small businesses, those will help power economies, lift people out of poverty, those are the markets for our goods in this hemisphere going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo today what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see is the President discussing our export agenda broadly in the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Also this particular initiative, which provides additional technical assistance to small businesses here in the United States who want to export to the Americas that networks U.S. small businesses and small businesses throughout the Americas so they can be each other\xe2\x80\x99s trading partners and provides additional financing for small businesses who want to get into those export markets through institutions like OPIC and the multilateral development banks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this will be a theme of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip -- the economic integration of the region and that includes, of course, Colombia and the FTA, that includes our efforts to increase trade investment across the region.\xc2\xa0 It also includes initiatives like the one that he\xe2\x80\x99s discussing today that will promote small-business export.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, I noticed that the foreign trips the President has taken in this election year are extremely short in duration\xc2\xa0 -- was just wondering what your thoughts are on trying to explain to the American people, particularly in an election year, why the President is traveling abroad and whether events like the one in Tampa today are designed to make that sort of case.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we made the case at a number of our foreign trips recently that the economic future of the United States is very much tied to our ability to export to new markets and to deepen our economic relationships around the world.\xc2\xa0 So that was a theme of our trip to the Asia-Pacific region, which is the fastest-growing region in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that similarly is going to be a theme of this trip, which again is the region in the world that we have the most exports with.\xc2\xa0 So I think the message to the American people is, building an American economy that is built to last is directly tied to our ability to increase exports to places like the Americas.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s directly relevant to the lives of the American people and the prosperity of the American people that he be out there advocating for U.S. businesses and workers and frankly, that insofar as we have positive relationships in this hemisphere that supports our prosperity, but it also makes us more secure and makes us more able to support the advance of democratic values like we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen across the Americas.\xc2\xa0 So I think these trips demonstrate the interconnection between international issues and the issues that matter to the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s also noteworthy, of course, that so many Americans increasingly have deep ties to the rest of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 Many Americans, of course, can trace their origins to Latin America and so those people -- the people connections are incredibly important here in the United States and to people across the hemisphere, and that\xe2\x80\x99s another theme that the President will be able to underscore throughout his travels.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one more question.\xc2\xa0 Back to D.C.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Are we done?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney is speaking to the NRA today to talk about Second Amendment issues, gun rights.\xc2\xa0 The President has not engaged on the issue of guns.\xc2\xa0 I wondered why and what message does the President have to gun owners of America?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday in the briefing, the President is focused on commonsense actions that protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get guns.\xc2\xa0 He directed his Department of Justice in the wake of the Gabby Giffords shooting to follow up on and take action on the principles I just laid out, and there have been -- there has been progress on those issues.\xc2\xa0 The Justice Department can provide more details about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But primarily it\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement -- enforcement of existing laws that you guys --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s very -- two things are very important:\xc2\xa0 the protection of Second Amendment rights and ensuring that the laws that exist to prevent people who should not have guns from getting guns are enforced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday on Hillary Rosen, you had mentioned in the briefing yesterday that -- Hillary Rosen had come about 30 times.\xc2\xa0 Have you followed up yet to find out if it was the Hillary Rosen who is a Democratic strategist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, let me address that broadly.\xc2\xa0 The point I was making yesterday is that often when we get inquiries about the visitor list, the WAVES list, just based on names, it turns out that people with common names appear -- how do I want to say this?\xc2\xa0 That sometimes there are other people with the same names.\xc2\xa0 This has happened on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 So all I was simply saying is that at that point, we had no way of verifying that this was one person.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also the case that a lot of -- for big events and things like that, that names show up but there are no -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no indication on a specific day that an individual actually came or left the White House.\xc2\xa0 So sometimes people are invited to or cleared in for big events but they don\xe2\x80\x99t come so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to sometimes be sure about how many times somebody has visited.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, it is certainly the case -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many occasions because of all those factors -- it is certainly the case that Hilary Rosen, Democratic strategist, has visited the White House on a number of occasions for large events or large meetings having to do with communications and things like that, but as Democrats have -- supporters of Democrats, Democratic strategists do on occasion.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific number for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No meetings with the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any meetings with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know when the President releases his tax in 2011 what his percentage is, what he is paying in taxes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They\'re releasing that information in Washington today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- his tax rate is lower than it has been in the past.\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s in -- this is an estimate -- actually, I didn\'t write down.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in the 20-21 percent range, I believe.\xc2\xa0 But please check the release.\xc2\xa0 Due to a couple of factors, one is his income is lower than it was in previous years, fluctuating nature of book sales.\xc2\xa0 Two, he and the First Lady contribute 22 percent of their adjusted gross income -- 22 percent, obviously, that has an impact on their tax rates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving said that, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, the President is -- on countless occasions -- people like me should be paying an effective tax rate that is no lower than the rate paid by hardworking, middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 That is the point of the Buffett Rule, and the -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve said often that -- people like the President should not be able to -- the tax code should not written in a way that allows for -- for the wealthiest Americans to pay taxes at a lower rate than middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the 22 -- 22?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe so, but I\xe2\x80\x99d just ask you to check -- I believe that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the paperwork with me.\xc2\xa0 They\'re releasing it out of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I will come down and do the week ahead -- sent it to me, and I didn\'t know -- so I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there travel next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We do travel --</p>\n<p>\n\t* * * * *</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, the schedule for the week of April 16.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will welcome Tony Stewart and the 2011 Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series drivers to the White House to honor Tony Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship.\xc2\xa0 The President will also recognize the efforts by Tony Stewart and NASCAR to give back to their community as part of their visit, continuing the tradition begun by President Obama honoring athletes and sports teams for their efforts on and off the field.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will travel to Cleveland, Ohio to deliver remarks at an event on the economy.\xc2\xa0 Later, he will travel to Michigan to attend campaign events.\xc2\xa0 The President will return to Washington D.C. that evening.\xc2\xa0 On Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Then on Friday, the President will welcome the Wounded Warrior Project\xe2\x80\x99s Soldier Ride to the White House.\xc2\xa0 That is your week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:05 A.M.
