EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Before I start taking -- start with questions, I have a couple of things I want to bring up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very sad, sad day here in the White House press office.\xc2\xa0 As some of you may know, the delightfully droll and sartorially splendid Reid Cherlin is leaving us; this is his last day.\xc2\xa0 He will be missed by all of us.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve only worked with him for a short while; a lot of folks have worked with him a lot longer.\xc2\xa0 And he is -- I know that he helped a lot of you over the years here, and he\xe2\x80\x99s just a terrific asset that we\xe2\x80\x99re losing.\xc2\xa0 So wish him well when you see him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next -- I just happened to notice this the other day and I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d throw it out there because we all like a little good news -- General Motors, you may have noticed, is by the fall going to hire back the final 2,000 of the workers that were laid off, which if you remember where we were just a few short years ago in terms of the economy in general and the American auto industry in particular, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a remarkable thing.\xc2\xa0 And so we think that\xe2\x80\x99s great.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to mention that the President participated in a National Security Council meeting earlier today on Libya, and also will tell you that in about 21 minutes he will speak with leaders of Congress about Libya in a conference call.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is what I have for you.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On that last point, can you tell us more about the call with Congress, who\xe2\x80\x99s taking part from their end?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list because I think it will partly depend on who is able to call in, since Congress is on recess, as you know.\xc2\xa0 So we will provide a list to you after the fact.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize the purpose --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about -- part of his consultations with Congress, part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s consultations with Congress, and he will update them on the situation in Libya, on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished thus far since the adoption of U.N. Security Council 1973.\xc2\xa0 And he will update them on the transition of command and control to NATO, which as you know is taking place as I speak.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s -- those are the issues he\xe2\x80\x99ll cover, and obviously he\xe2\x80\x99ll answer some questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bipartisan, I assume?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow on the -- you just mentioned command and control.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to try to get a little clarity on that.\xc2\xa0 The NATO Secretary General said yesterday that \xe2\x80\x9cthere will still be a coalition operation and a NATO operation.\xc2\xa0 We are considering whether NATO should take on the broader responsibility in accordance with the U.N. Security resolution.\xc2\xa0 But that decision has not been made yet.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then a senior administration official said last night that NATO had in fact agreed to the entire operation.\xc2\xa0 So can you clarify which --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are two aspects of this.\xc2\xa0 The senior administration official is correct, but the -- what has already happened and is occurring now is the transfer of command and control over the no-fly zone to NATO.\xc2\xa0 That is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has been agreed to but the details of which -- the military planning aspect of which has not yet been finalized is the transfer of the rest of that, the civilian protection aspect of the military mission.\xc2\xa0 So that, we expect, it will be wrapped up in the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0 But it has been agreed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House position is that NATO will take control over the entire operation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of time on the last part.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the position of our NATO allies and the coalition partners, but yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Patricia.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Syria -- which way does the United States see Syria going?\xc2\xa0 And what are you hearing from allies in the region?\xc2\xa0 Any concerns?\xc2\xa0 What are their concerns?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House still think that President Assad is still legitimate -- is legitimate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We strongly condemn the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to repress and intimidate demonstrators, and we are calling for an immediate cease to the violence and killings of civilians at the hands of the Syrian security forces.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same position we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken throughout the region, and we condemn it strongly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have obviously, as we always do, consulted with our allies in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we urge upon the Syrian government that they pursue a non-violent path, that they pursue political dialogue, because the future of this region depends upon -- the stability and future of this region depends upon the decision by governments to listen to their people, to act on their legitimate aspirations, and to open up their systems so that the people of these countries can have a greater stake in the future of their country and their own futures.\xc2\xa0 So we take the same position with Syria as we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken with others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also -- you know, we\xe2\x80\x99re also deeply troubled by the arbitrary arrests of human rights activists in Syria, and we urge them to cease that practice, as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you in touch with President Assad at all?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 But we are making clear from here and from other places what our position is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 GE in 2010 made more than $14 billion in profits, $5 billion here in the U.S., and yet GE paid no taxes last year.\xc2\xa0 Given that the CEO of GE is the head of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Competitiveness and Jobs Council, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any thoughts on their paying no taxes last year, as opposed to probably every single person in this room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hope so.\xc2\xa0 But the -- look, Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just tell you I don\'t know about this specific company\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet or its tax returns.\xc2\xa0 But I --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s on the front page of The New York Times today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I can -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve read the story.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying I don\'t have my own assessment to make of it.\xc2\xa0 But what I will tell you is that the President has said that he is committed to corporate tax reform, and he wants to do that because it will improve our competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that one of the ways to do that -- the way to do it is to -- you can lower the rate if you -- and still bring in the necessary revenue if you remove a lot of the loopholes and other aspects of it that make it complicated, that give companies fits and also make us less competitive in the process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to corporate tax reform because it\xe2\x80\x99s right for growth, it\xe2\x80\x99s right for job creation, and he will have that conversation going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it bother him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to the President about this, but he is bothered by what I think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at, which is that Americans, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, who read that story or heard about it are wondering how this could be.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons why it could be -- again, not addressing the specific company because I don\'t know independently about that -- but it is part of the problem of the corporate tax structure that companies hire armies of tax lawyers to understand how it works and to take advantage of the various loopholes that exist that are legal in order to reduce their tax burden.\xc2\xa0 And he thinks that in the name -- for the purpose of greater competitiveness and job creation, we have to address our corporate tax structure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if in the name of competitiveness and job creation, the President feels we have to address our corporate tax structure, why appoint to the head of the Competitiveness and Jobs Council a person who is now the poster child for using the system to get out of paying taxes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Job Council and Competitiveness Council is designed for just that, and he has brought together a lot of voices on that and he wants to hear the opinions of every member of that council.\xc2\xa0 And we have said, with regards to questions about other members who\xe2\x80\x99ve been appointed, that the President obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to counsel the people who agree with him on every issue -- he wants to hear diversity of opinion.\xc2\xa0 In the end, the decisions that are made about which policy to pursue on corporate tax reform will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision and his policy.\xc2\xa0 So I think that addresses that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a perception problem at all for the President?\xc2\xa0 He says he wants to take on this issue and yet --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He very much wants to take on this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the second year in a row I believe that GE didn\'t pay any taxes, and yet he appoints the CEO to the head of his Competiveness and Jobs Council.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the issue, Jake, is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that not feed a cynicism that the American people might have?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, because the President is very committed to addressing this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So much so that he puts the CEO of GE at the head of his Jobs and Competitiveness Council?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- Jake, we can do this five or six times.\xc2\xa0 But he is committed to corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 He believes that -- one of the reasons why he addressed it before this story came out, or stories -- is because that this is not an unusual situation; that the tax code is complex, it\xe2\x80\x99s filled with loopholes, and other pieces of it that make it possible for corporations to reduce their tax burden.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the companies in terms of their competitiveness and potential for growth, and it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not good overall for job creation in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why he wants to address it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The call that the President will be having with lawmakers, is that in direct response to some of the criticism that he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting from up on the Hill that these lawmakers were not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because you said it had to happen, Dan.\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then I\xe2\x80\x99m glad he\xe2\x80\x99s listening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t go through it again today, but the list I read you yesterday of the series of consultations and briefings that the President and members of his administration have had with both leadership and rank-and-file members and committee members on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he is -- he looks forward, when Congress is back, to having these meetings in person, but while they\xe2\x80\x99re on recess he looks forward, in just a matter of minutes, to updating them on our progress, all that has been accomplished, the lives that have been saved, the incredible speed with which we have done what we said we would do, what the President said we would do, which was transfer command and control to NATO, and then update them on the progress or how we see things going forward.\xc2\xa0 But this is one in a series of consultations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys are listening to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening up on the Hill, the criticism.\xc2\xa0 Was there concern in the White House about the ongoing pressure, if you will, for the President to speak with lawmakers, explain what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing in Libya --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go back to what I said yesterday, which is that we have consulted with Congress.\xc2\xa0 I read a lengthy list of engagements that members of the administration have with Congress on this issue.\xc2\xa0 We understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s our responsibility.\xc2\xa0 We take the need to consult very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to do that, as will senior members of his administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will also say that -- what I said yesterday, but it bears repeating -- that there was an urgency to act here.\xc2\xa0 And had the President waited, given the preponderance of evidence that was available to everyone that Colonel Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces were about to move on Benghazi and wreak horrible damage and kill many, many Libyans, had he waited for Congress to come back, had he waited for more -- taken more time to debate and consult on this issue, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s very little doubt that Benghazi would have fallen and that many people would have died.\xc2\xa0 And he believes very strongly that he made the right decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the no-fly zone in Iraq, years of no-fly zone pressure did nothing to run Saddam Hussein from power, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if in Libya, is the administration prepared for a long, drawn-out process where Libya remains under the control of Muammar Qaddafi?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the -- even the -- the military mission that is described in Security Council Resolution 1973 goes beyond just the no-fly zone, as you know, and it includes the civilian protection piece that enables -- well, enables the coalition to do more to protect civilians than I believe the no-fly zone allowed in northern Iraq.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, as you know, on a separate track, it is the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position, the President has stated often, that Muammar Qaddafi is not fit to lead and that we believe he should leave power.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged in a host of actions, unilaterally and multilaterally, that are designed to put pressure on Qaddafi, to put pressure on those around him, with the aim of -- that he will take the decision or those around him will take the decision that he has to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we don\xe2\x80\x99t have crystal balls here and I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict what the future will bring, but we will stay focused on those measures even as the military mission reaches benchmarks of success, and as the transfer occurs we will continue with those tools that we have to put pressure on Qaddafi and his regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the administration is pushing for a coup?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what I said.\xc2\xa0 I think we said that the Libyan people -- we have said the Libyan people need to decide who their leaders are.\xc2\xa0 We think, quite clearly, that Qaddafi has lost legitimacy in the eyes of his people, not least because he has murdered his people in large numbers.\xc2\xa0 And the purpose of many of the measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, including financial sanctions and other measures, are aimed at putting pressure on him and isolating him so that he either makes the decision or those around him come to the conclusion that the future is not bright for this regime and that its capacity to function is severely limited in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike has to run to a live shot, so he\xe2\x80\x99s butting in line.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thank the gentleman.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please give him something to report.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 How can I help you, Mike?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used the verb \xe2\x80\x9cconsult.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cconsulting\xe2\x80\x9d Congress.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been complaining that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been informing them but not consulting -- for example, the meeting last Friday that was here or by teleconference or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Some members were here and some called in.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re consulting them, to what end are you consulting them?\xc2\xa0 Are you asking them for congressional action, or why not just tell them what\xe2\x80\x99s going on and inform them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we want to hear what they think, and we want -- if they have suggestions about things that we should be doing, obviously the President wants to hear that.\xc2\xa0 It is well within, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve described and others have described, well within the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority to take this military action.\xc2\xa0 The precedent -- the list of precedents is quite long.\xc2\xa0 But he believes that consultations with Congress are important, and he does want to hear their thoughts about the mission, about the situation in Libya, and about our overall policy there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the question of leading the coalition, have we ever led the coalition?\xc2\xa0 Are we still leading the coalition?\xc2\xa0 When will we stop leading the coalition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were a principal actor in the first phase of the military mission because of our unique capacity and capabilities that were brought to bear in sort of creating the environment necessary to enforce a no-fly zone and creating an environment where Qaddafi forces that were menacing cities like Benghazi and Misurata could be --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But a principal actor leaves open the question of someone else leading --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we were -- I mean, there was no question that we were leading in the first phase.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re first among equals?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s a partnership, but we -- at least in the early, the first several days were flying the majority of the sorties and doing the majority of the missions, although others were, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that ratio has been shifting day by day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And today -- to answer the second part of your question -- today, as I speak, the authority -- command and control authority for the enforcement of the no-fly zone is being shifted to NATO.\xc2\xa0 It will no longer be a U.S. lead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The authority for -- there is an agreement for the command and control over the rest of the mission, the civilian protection mission.\xc2\xa0 There is an agreement at a political level and the military plans that -- associated with that are being worked out now and will be worked out in the next several days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I yield back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Reid.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say that the United States has had a leader -- has been leading in the first phase.\xc2\xa0 So that means the President, the Commander-in-Chief, has been the leader of this operation so far.\xc2\xa0 Will he be giving up that leadership role as the transition happens?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, we have made clear from the start, from the moment the President announced his decision to take this, that our role in the lead would be a matter of days, not weeks, as we brought to bear our unique assets and capabilities to create an environment in Libya that allowed our allies to enforce the no-fly zone and our allies to take the lead in civilian protection.\xc2\xa0 That process is underway right now, as he said.\xc2\xa0 He said what he would do, and he\xe2\x80\x99s doing what he said.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t see the confusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not confusion, really.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot of people -- mostly Republicans but even some Democrats -- are uncomfortable with the whole concept of the United States and the President stepping back from a leadership role in such a major international action --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of voices, Chip, about how we should approach this.\xc2\xa0 One thing I know that the President believes strongly is that the wrong course of action would have been, in this country or other countries, unilateral military action to remove the leader of an Arab country.\xc2\xa0 I am confident that most Americans think that would have been a bad approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Instead he pursued a policy where we worked very quickly to build an international coalition that includes Arab support -- vitally important -- to launch this military action against Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces.\xc2\xa0 It is the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It is the smart thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And it is the best thing to do in terms of U.S. national interests in the long term, because, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said about Libya and other countries, it is vitally important that the unrest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and the transformation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in these countries that is unfolding every day now be recognized for what it is, which is organic.\xc2\xa0 It is about the people of these countries demanding to be heard, demanding greater rights, greater freedoms, and less repression.\xc2\xa0 It is not about the United States of America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not -- making that decision is about leadership.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about keeping your eye on the ball about what\'s in the interests of the American people, in our national security interests.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the primary purpose of all this was to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 If it becomes clear that that is no longer an imminent threat, will the President pull American forces out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The mission, as you just rightly stated, is to protect civilians -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the military mission -- and the United States will continue to participate in the coalition to enforce the mandate given by the United States -- the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 for as long as is necessary to make sure that those civilians are protected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in answer to Dan\xe2\x80\x99s question, are pursuing a whole host of other measures, unilaterally and multilaterally, with our partners to continue to put pressure on the Libyan regime, on the Qaddafi regime.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to -- one last question to clarify.\xc2\xa0 The Pentagon says that U.S. pilots -- well, they anticipate that U.S. pilots will continue to participate in strike missions -- not just surveillance, but strike missions in Libya -- even after the transition.\xc2\xa0 To whom will those pilots be reporting -- somebody other than Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll refer you to the Pentagon for the specifics.\xc2\xa0 I believe, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, that in terms of -- and I don\'t -- the details lie across the river at the Defense Department, but it is certainly the case that while we -- the control -- command and control transition is still pending on the civilian protection aspect of this, that the United States will continue to fly sorties as part of that mission.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\'s a matter of days and not weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of our -- we\xe2\x80\x99re taking --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon was making clear that this would go on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But overall it\xe2\x80\x99s about a lead role, okay?\xc2\xa0 And I will refer you to the Pentagon to the details of what we will continue to be doing.\xc2\xa0 But what we will not be is in the lead in either the no-fly zone or the civilian protection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President comfortable having U.S. pilots report to foreign commands?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this President and the previous President was comfortable having United States forces report to NATO commanders -- non-American NATO commanders in Afghanistan, and that\'s how NATO works, so we feel very comfortable with the structure of NATO.\xc2\xa0 It is, by the way, the most successful and powerful military alliance in the history of the world.\xc2\xa0 And we think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a good one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the broad coalition the President has built is the right, smart and best thing to do in terms of U.S. national interest, but also appear to move more slowly than a coalition of folks more on the same page.\xc2\xa0 Is that just an acceptable trade-off?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Wendell, I would certainly say that it was worth the time to assemble a coalition.\xc2\xa0 I would also say that the time was pretty compressed.\xc2\xa0 If you look at any historical precedent for this kind of action to be taken, this kind of collective action by our international partners, there is no comparison at all.\xc2\xa0 And I think in the past -- I have given you a blow by blow of the comparison in terms of sanctions taken in Bosnia, or the use of military kinetic force in Bosnia and how long it took for the world to act in those case.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s certainly true in a host of previous examples.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the speed here was I think notable, and the need to do it with a coalition of international partners was essential.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that it is U.S. policy that Qaddafi has lost his legitimacy and should go but that is not the goal of the U.N. Security Council resolution, one of the questions Speaker Boehner has is can military action in Libya end with Qaddafi still in power?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a question that depends on Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s decision regarding the use of force and violence against his people, against the people of Libya -- I dare say they\'re not \xe2\x80\x9chis\xe2\x80\x9d people.\xc2\xa0 The mission of the United States, the mission of the military coalition authorized by the United Nations Security Council is to protect Libyan civilians, and that mission continues as long as Libyan civilians are threatened by Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning if he stops threatening them --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t want to predict the future and how this plays out.\xc2\xa0 What I have said is what the mission is.\xc2\xa0 I have also, I think, elaborated on what -- the other actions we have taken and what their goal and purpose is.\xc2\xa0 And those continue now and in the future regardless of -- or in concert with the military mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State Clinton said she feared Libya could become another Somalia with groups like al Qaeda and Islamic Maghreb.\xc2\xa0 Is the lack of boots on the ground, if you will, leaving an opening for them?\xc2\xa0 Do you need a more robust --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we -- the President has made very clear that we are not sending American troops into Libya on the ground.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously working in a variety of ways to reach out to the opposition in Libya, to advise them on what a post-Qaddafi Libya would best look like in the sense that we believe that as with every government -- every country in the region, that the government that is most responsive to the aspirations and grievances of its people will be the most successful.\xc2\xa0 So those consultations are obviously part of our policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This might sound like a silly question, but the format of the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to lawmakers, will they be allowed -- will it just be him talking or will they be allowed to ask him questions and give him suggestions --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s a conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if his update will include cost analysis of the war or the -- not the war, excuse me -- of the conflict?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That may come up.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, since it\xe2\x80\x99s happening now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any update of when we will hear from him, or the public will hear from him, considering all the confusion?\xc2\xa0 Everyone is asking about --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From the President?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, excuse me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, I can tell you with great confidence, will speak about this in the relatively near future, will -- as he has numerous times in the last several days.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s vitally important, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of his role as President and Commander-in-Chief to speak to the American people about an operation like this, and he will do that in the very near future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hours or days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a time or a day --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will it be after the transition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but in the very near future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the venue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not today, but very near future.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- you guys can pepper me with questions, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the weekly address on, Jay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The weekly address is embargoed, Mark, as you know, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to announce the subject now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 Might he mention Libya in the Greek event?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that whatever he talks about in the weekly address, that if it were to mention Libya it would not be the only time that he addresses the American people on the subject of Libya in the very near future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You might save yourself a lot of questions if you put the conference call on the mult.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that with the number of people on that call, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the contents of it --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the mult already?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The contents of the conversation will be known to you all very soon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A former Libyan Prime Minister who was taking part in talks at the African Union today says his country is ready to talk with opposition rebels and accept political reforms, possibly even elections.\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of this?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 How serious is this offer?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without addressing the specific offer, we are aware of contacts that various members of the regime have made -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that generally.\xc2\xa0 But what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know is what they amount to, in terms of the outcome that they would bear.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of contacts that are being made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been specific discussions with this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into details about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And why do you think a Gallup poll that was conducted this week shows support for the mission in Libya as the lowest at the start of any U.S. military action in the past three decades?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And how high was it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was 47 percent compared to 51 percent of Americans who approved of Kosovo.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the American people have a lot on their mind and a lot on their plate right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused -- the American people have, as well as the government, on the tragic events in Japan.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot for anybody to process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision is the right one, and he will speak to the American people, as he has in the past, about how he made his decision, what the objectives are, and why he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing for the United States and for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last week 64 senators wrote to the President asking him to play a more active role in the long-term budget talks.\xc2\xa0 When they come back into session next week, what should we look for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to the longer-term issues that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not the 2011 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The debt-related issues.\xc2\xa0 And as he had said, very much looks forward to doing that.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it is precisely the path that needs to be taken, a conversation with members of both parties, everybody getting into the boat at the same time so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tip over, and that that\'s the only way that we can effectively deal with these difficult issues, which have proven so hard to deal with in the past because they are complex and politically charged; that the way to do that is to do it in a bipartisan way and a conversation where a lot of folks from both parties participate.\xc2\xa0 So he welcomes that and looks forward to doing it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously he and they, the leaders of Congress and the members of Congress, still have some unfinished business to attend to in terms of the finishing up the 2011 fiscal year budget, which is last year\xe2\x80\x99s business and needs to be attended to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does he think that has to be done first before that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think nobody believes -- we are open to all sorts of ideas for funding the government for the remainder of fiscal year 2011.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through the various parameters the President has set, and the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come more than halfway towards the Republicans, and negotiations are ongoing at many levels.\xc2\xa0 I believe the Vice President -- we put out the fact that the Vice President made some phone calls on this yesterday, and senior administration officials are engaged in these conversations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, without prescribing the contents of that deal, which is only a one-year deal, what I think is irrefutable is that no single-year fiscal deal is going to resolve the long-term debt issues that face us in terms of entitlements, tax expenditures, defense spending, and all the major drivers of long-term debt that have to be addressed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have confidence in Mr. Immelt to run the Jobs Council?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he does.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, he does.\xc2\xa0 And then the second question is, Christina Romer this week gave a speech where she said the 8.9 percent unemployment is a \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute crisis\xe2\x80\x9d and she said that it\xe2\x80\x99s shameful that people in Washington, including the administration and the Federal Reserve, are not doing enough.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with those remarks?\xc2\xa0 Has he heard about that?\xc2\xa0 And what is his reaction?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about those, but we certainly agree that 8.9 percent, while it has come down substantially from its high, is much too high.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President engaged with Republicans to reach the bipartisan tax cut deal that he reached in the lame duck session in December.\xc2\xa0 And within that deal are a lot of things that address growth, address job creation, and we think will have already been effective in terms of improving the economic picture in the first quarter of this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99re doing all you can to reduce unemployment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are doing everything we can, working with Congress, to address these issues.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s taken dramatic measures, as you know, in the first two years, two plus years, of his presidency, because nothing is a higher priority for him than economic growth, job creation, innovation, education, infrastructure as the drivers of economic growth and job creation in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is -- a lot of folks have asked about, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through these significant events in the early part of this year, how can you still go out and give speeches on education or the economy?\xc2\xa0 Because, first of all, he\xe2\x80\x99s President of the United States and it is the responsibility of the President to do many things at once, to keep his focus on a number of high priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But secondly, because this is vitally important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he went to South America, because this is a region of the world that will contribute greatly to the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 So I think his commitment is extremely strong on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the instability in Yemen increasing and the massive protests and counterprotests today, is it in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interests that President Saleh stay in power?\xc2\xa0 And has President Obama spoken with him in the last few weeks, either to suggest that he step down or stay or for any other reason?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has spoken to President Saleh, although we can double-check that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, and I believe we\xe2\x80\x99ve read out, John Brennan, the homeland security advisor, has, on several occasions, spoken with him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But going back to the top of your question, it is not for us to decide the leaders of other countries.\xc2\xa0 We have said to the leadership in Yemen what we have said to the leadership in other countries.\xc2\xa0 It is not acceptable to use violence against peaceful protesters.\xc2\xa0 We condemn that.\xc2\xa0 We urge upon the leaders of these countries the idea that they pursue peaceful political dialogue with the broad swath of their -- representatives of the people of their countries to respond to -- there is a reason for these protests, and to hear them and respond to them and to reform accordingly.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our position in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our position across the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this country has a particular interest for us because it has al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have interests and important relationships across the region.\xc2\xa0 It is an extraordinarily important region of the world where we have problem relationships and ally relationships.\xc2\xa0 The principles apply to all of them.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with governments in the region, advising them on what we think they should do, the right course of action, the political dialogue, the nonviolent response to these protests.\xc2\xa0 And again, that applies to Yemen; it applies across the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can we come back to the civilian protection part of the Libya mission?\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that you expect that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be resolved in the next few days, but isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a little more -- well, not a little -- a lot more difficult?\xc2\xa0 Turkey has objected to participation in air strikes; the Germans, of course, are not participating in the mission, in general military terms.\xc2\xa0 What I\'m getting at is, is it not a setback that NATO did not take everything under its wing right away?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we talked yesterday about what days, not weeks, meant, and that we\xe2\x80\x99re still not even at one week yet, so we have -- before we get to plural of weeks, we have quite a few number of days left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A setback?\xc2\xa0 Under what construct could six days, in terms of transfer from the U.S. lead to NATO command and control for the no-fly zone be a prolonged period of time, and two more days, or several more days, to resolve the underlying issues of an agreement that has already been reached on civilian protection, the civilian protection aspect?\xc2\xa0 Again, that is a very remarkably short period of time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We believe that coalitions -- obviously everybody needs to be consulted, everybody participates in the agreements and the discussions.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what coalitions are about.\xc2\xa0 We think that this has functioned remarkably well, given the circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But hasn\xe2\x80\x99t this gone on for weeks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wait, wait, wait.\xc2\xa0 What, what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the conflict has been going on for weeks, so you can\xe2\x80\x99t say it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of days --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The military mission was authorized --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- by the military, but the conflict --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The military mission has been -- this is day six, right, I believe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the military operation, but the conflict itself.\xc2\xa0 So the administration and the international community --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was authorized a few days before that.\xc2\xa0 Look, I will not argue with the fact that because of the need to act quickly, that every T was not crossed and every I dotted prior to this.\xc2\xa0 We did not have that luxury.\xc2\xa0 But the reality is that in that environment, the coalition has worked extremely well and extremely quickly to come to these agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about this new phase and the United States no longer in the lead, should Americans assume from that that American warplanes will no longer be flying over that area?\xc2\xa0 Will the American forces that are still participating be under foreign -- a foreign commander?\xc2\xa0 And is the impression now that the U.S. doing the jamming and the -- is literally kind of out of the combat, less risk to American personnel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the less direct engagement you have -- to start at the end of your list of questions, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s always risky.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that risk will continue, just because American forces are in the region advising and assisting as part of this coalition.\xc2\xa0 But the risk would, I think, logically be reduced the less -- the fewer flights we\xe2\x80\x99re flying and the fewer actions we\xe2\x80\x99re taking that are kinetic, so to speak.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the specifics of airplanes in the sky, the ratio has gone down dramatically, will continue to go down.\xc2\xa0 I believe we have said -- I would refer you to the Pentagon for the specifics -- that on the no-fly zone aspect of this, we will not be participating in the flights.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- on the details, I think the Pentagon has the best information.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefing at the same time that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefing on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Members of the Congress after the conversation they had with the President last Friday at noon complained that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask questions the way the conference call was set.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether he is actually taking questions from members --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that there was a discussion and various members did have questions, did have comments in that briefing that the President gave.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how many are actually with the President today, or is it all by teleconference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have any physically with the President.\xc2\xa0 We can check on that once we find out who was able to participate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe the American people understand why we\xe2\x80\x99re taking military action in Libya, but say, for example, not Bahrain, where there is also unrest, protests, a non-democratic form of government?\xc2\xa0 And does the President owe the American people sort of a clear explanation of what the standard is for military intervention in this region?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question, and I think the President, as I said, will address in the very near future some of the answers to these questions or the answers to these specific questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people do expect and will get from this President what they have gotten in the past, which is a very clear explanation of the decisions he makes when he makes the significant decision to engage in military action, to send America\xe2\x80\x99s men and women in uniform into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think on the question of what\'s different about Libya, I think scale is important here.\xc2\xa0 The enormity of the potential violence -- well, the amount of violence that had occurred against civilian populations but also what was about to occur, and the promises made by Qaddafi himself on what he would do to the people of Benghazi were obviously factors in this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Abby.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, President Obama, in answer to a question about whether Qaddafi -- what would happen if Qaddafi remained in power, said, unless he changes his approach and provides the Libyan people with an opportunity to express themselves freely, and there are significant reforms in the Libyan government, unless he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to step down, there are going to be potential threats.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering is it still a possibility for Qaddafi to make changes to his government, to reform, or does he absolutely have to go, regardless of what reforms --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our position that he needs to leave, that he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer legitimate.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that when you read that quote, that you read it to the end, where he said that part of that is stepping down.\xc2\xa0 And what I think -- what I know the President was saying is what we have said and he has said in the past, which is that he is obviously menacing his own people, using violence against his own people, it continues, and as long as he remains in power, it is certainly, given past behavior, not to be expected that he will no longer be a menace to his own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the change of mind that we would hope he would reach is to cease and desist the violence and to give up power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the context --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, in the context of the reports that there are these talks ongoing, if the consequence of these talks are that the Libyan leaders are willing to go forward with reforms but that Qaddafi wants to stay in power, we would not accept that as an option?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to entertain that hypothetical because the world as it is -- complicated enough.\xc2\xa0 So I will stick to what we know and not what we may or may not be able to predict.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, Lester.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was next.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on Syria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to me?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll tell you what.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying two questions.\xc2\xa0 How about one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another two-parter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both the Washington Post and the Washington Times report the arrest of 130 illegal aliens in Virginia this week.\xc2\xa0 Is the President gratified or sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no response because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about those arrests.\xc2\xa0 I would tell you that the President believes that it is very important to enforce our immigration laws.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s my response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow one -- just one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that illegal aliens who repeat their invading after being drafted and are -- who commit additional crimes should just continue being sent back?\xc2\xa0 Or should they be imprisoned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure I understand your question.\xc2\xa0 But I will just refer you to what I said, which is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What if they repeat their crimes?\xc2\xa0 If they\xe2\x80\x99re sent back and then they go back again and repeat their crimes, does he think they should just be sent back or imprisoned?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President is committed to enforcement of our immigration laws.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, does the President think that Assad still has legitimacy to govern?\xc2\xa0 That seemed to have been a threshold issue on his policy on Libya, and in Syria you start to see the violence against his own people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which we strongly condemn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 Does he still have the legitimacy to govern?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that we strongly condemn the violence.\xc2\xa0 We urge on the government of Syria what we have urged on the governments in other regions:\xc2\xa0 that they pursue a peaceful course here; that they participate in a political dialogue with their people because that is the better path.\xc2\xa0 And we also urge the Syrian government to refrain from in any way detaining or -- human rights activists or journalists as part of this position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if he -- if they continue violence against --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There you go with hypotheticals.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a very long stretch to be hypothetical in Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 Is that a threshold?\xc2\xa0 Is there a point at which --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- tips the scale on legitimacy to govern?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in that hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 I just would say that our position now is that we strongly condemn what\xe2\x80\x99s been happening and are monitoring it very closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Secretary Gates said in Tel Aviv that he\xe2\x80\x99s carrying a message that it was time to take bold actions towards implementing the two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 Was he carrying a detailed message from the President?\xc2\xa0 Is the President ready to do and make bold actions, as well, to implement the peace process and to have the two states?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he was certainly -- without going into any -- the details, the Secretary was expressing the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view that both sides need to take bold steps towards peace, that that is the only resolution to this vexing problem.\xc2\xa0 And he encourages both sides to do that.\xc2\xa0 And he also, as you know, spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu and expressed his condolences about the bombing in Jerusalem and the other -- the attacks that they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And we urge restraint and we urge both sides to take bold steps towards peace.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You often hear in Washington disquiet about the extent to which some European nations have been cutting their defense budgets and the extent to which they are able to kind of join international military operations.\xc2\xa0 Given that, how important is the successful resolution of this Libyan action to proving that -- or to ascertaining whether they can actually alleviate the burden on the U.S.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very gratified, Stephen, by the willingness of coalition members to participate in this very important endeavor, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of the strength of our international partnerships and our alliance in the case of NATO.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a welcome sign about our ability to work together to solve or to address some of these very difficult problems.\xc2\xa0 And we really do think that that\'s an effective way to tackle some of these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start jumping around here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Given what you mentioned about your reaching out to the opposition, the Libyan opposition, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President recognize the interim council in Benghazi as the legitimate representative of Libya?\xc2\xa0 Is he skeptical?\xc2\xa0 And is arming them still a possibility in order to achieve U.S. policy goal of getting Qaddafi to step down?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past is that we are looking at a variety of ways to assist the opposition, and that continues.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- as you know, the Secretary of State met with the head of the National Council, and that was a form of recognition about the importance of that body.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re not at a point where we\'re going to pick leaders.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for the Libyan people to have a voice in that process.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not trying to set benchmarks on how this will work.\xc2\xa0 But we are working with the opposition, consulting with the opposition, looking at ways we can assist them, and that work continues every day.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kara.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Braley, a Democrat from Iowa, said that your answer yesterday on the cost of the operations was unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And I understand obviously that you don\'t want to get into predicting future costs, but why can\'t you guys say how much has been spent so far over the six days, or even just last weekend?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have the figures, Kara, and I\'m certain that part of our consultations with Congress will address this issue.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that we feel confident, given the nature and the limitations on the mission, that it can be paid for within existing budget appropriations because there are funds that exist for that purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Sheridan, I see your hand is up there.\xc2\xa0 Welcome back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You had my question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Congratulations, by the way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, assistance to the opposition -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve ruled out, just to be clear, non -- military assistance, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not -- I think that we actually -- there was a few weeks ago a statement that the arms embargo prevented us from doing that, and in fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility within that to take that action if we thought that were the right way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s still possibility --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s right, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir, blue shirt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify something you said earlier?\xc2\xa0 You said the U.S. would remain committed to the coalition as long as it takes to keep the civilians safe.\xc2\xa0 So is the military participation from the U.S. coalition-dependent?\xc2\xa0 If the coalition dissolves, will then the military participation from the U.S. also go away?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The world is complicated enough for me not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 You\'re saying if something happens, will the U.S. do something.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration has stressed so many times the importance of the coalition in going in.\xc2\xa0 And so if that\'s the case, then someone has to have raised that question in the national security meeting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding, my reading of Resolution 1973 is, it does not have a time limit on it.\xc2\xa0 It is -- says that the coalition will --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have a coalition limit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
