GMT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other questions since you just spoke to the President, but Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor, joins me today and we are here to take your questions as we make our way to South Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One domestic question.\xc2\xa0 I heard that the President had made calls to Senator Schumer and maybe others.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us about that?\xc2\xa0 Read those out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I meant to say that at the top.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nice notepad.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good -- it\xe2\x80\x99s Alyssa Mastromonaco\xe2\x80\x99s seat card.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President, last night after returning from the official dinner, spoke with Leader Pelosi, Speaker Boehner, Senator Graham, Senator McCain, Senator Bennet, and Senator Schumer about immigration reform -- obviously congratulating the four senators who were members of the Gang of the Eight on their efforts and they paid off so well in the passage with a large bipartisan majority in the Senate of the immigration reform bill.\xc2\xa0 He also tried to reach, but was not able to, Senator Flake, Senator Rubio, Senator Menendez, and Senator Durbin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe spoke, as I mentioned at the top, with Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi, and urged them to take up immigration reform now that the Senate had passed a comprehensive bill with a large bipartisan majority.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it usually difficult for him to get in touch with lawmakers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was pretty late at night, obviously, in Dakar, so sometimes we can\xe2\x80\x99t reach somebody.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think everybody that we could reach was happy to take the call.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the strategy going to be?\xc2\xa0 Like how many days to try and corral support in the House and make sure that they consider the Senate bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously work with the House in the same way that we worked with the Senate, which is to make clear what our principles are and to provide the significant amount of policy expertise that we have, and data that we have, and to be as helpful to the process as we can.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to plot out a strategy for you, except to note that this is an effort that enjoyed substantial bipartisan support in the Senate, that enjoys substantial bipartisan support across the country, that is a boon -- would be, if passed -- a boon to our economy, a boon to the middle class, would reduce the deficit significantly in both the first 10 years and then hugely in the second 10 years, and would increase innovation and job creation at home because, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the statistics, there is -- when we modernize our legal immigration system, we enhance the prospects of keeping highly talented entrepreneurs in the United States so that they can create businesses and jobs in the industries of the future in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then add on top of that the enormous strides we\xe2\x80\x99ve made when it comes to border security already since President Obama has taken office, and the fact that, in keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s core principles, this bill that passed the Senate would go further to enhance border security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion with Speaker Boehner when he was at the White House the other day -- if the bill looked on track to pass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I think Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office read out, the conversation the other day with the four leaders of the Congress was focused on foreign policy, and the aftermath of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings with President Xi in California, as well as the G8 Summit, and his meeting -- his state visit to Germany.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say anything about where Sasha was yesterday?\xc2\xa0 Is she okay?\xc2\xa0 Because we noticed she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the events.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In general, we refer questions about the family to the East Wing, to the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s office, but she\xe2\x80\x99s fine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was that really the President\xe2\x80\x99s long-lost friend from Spain at the dinner last night?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I know he was very glad to meet him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, the interesting thing I mentioned to some of you is that he was actually remarking on remembering meeting that person.\xc2\xa0 He said he remembered it quite vividly, had written about it in \xe2\x80\x9cDreams of My Father\xe2\x80\x9d before he knew that he would be attending the dinner.\xc2\xa0 So it was a surprise but it certainly is an account that the President remembered.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, it had an impact here in Senegal.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in many of the countries is \xe2\x80\x9cDreams of My Father\xe2\x80\x9d is a book that tells a story about the President\xe2\x80\x99s life but also a story that speaks to what\xe2\x80\x99s possible for people from the African continent.\xc2\xa0 And so clearly in Senegal they took great pride in that encounter and how the President remembered it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he talk to this Selle at the dinner?\xc2\xa0 Did they have any other conversation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of -- because the President was at the head table, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he talked to him on the way out or not.\xc2\xa0 It was a very lively state dinner and, interestingly, the Minister of Tourism in Senegal is also a Grammy Award-winning artist.\xc2\xa0 And so he got up and took the mic, and sang a few songs.\xc2\xa0 Jay seemed to be nodding his head, I think.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And we remarked that there is no U.S. Cabinet member that could stand up and sing for 30 minutes at a state dinner.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was amazing.\xc2\xa0 It was a fantastic performance, actually -- a wonderful dinner.\xc2\xa0 I know the President and First Lady enjoyed it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President sing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President did not sing.\xc2\xa0 It was -- very little of it was in English.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Just one scheduling update on tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to give you guys a little bit of background.\xc2\xa0 So, as you know, in addition to the bilateral meeting, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a town hall with young African leaders.\xc2\xa0 And just so you get a little more background on the format, first of all, this is taking place in Soweto, which is obviously an inspirational location for South Africans, given its role in the anti-Apartheid movement, particularly the June, 1976 protests against Apartheid.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut also we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be bringing in young people at locations in Uganda, Nigeria, and Kenya.\xc2\xa0 And so young people in those locations will have an opportunity to participate in the town hall, to ask questions of the President.\xc2\xa0 It will be broadcast in those countries on NTV Uganda, Channels TV Nigeria, and KBC Kenya.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, these are countries we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to get to on this trip who are really important partners to the United States.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd by bringing in these virtual locations, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to reach hundreds of millions of people through the broadcast of this town hall.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll also be amplifying it on all of our digital and social media platforms.\xc2\xa0 The Young African Leaders Program that this grows out of is one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve briefed you on -- the President initiated it in Washington, the First Lady held a town hall in South Africa -- but there have been over 2,000 events across Africa focused on the development of young African leaders.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTomorrow, the President will be discussing how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to expand this into an exchange program that can over the next several years bring a significant number of Africans to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have additional details for you guys on that after we land, but I think the town hall speaks to the ability for the President to speak to young people not just in South Africa, but in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and across the continent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this the HBCU event?\xc2\xa0 The event that deals with HBCUs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 HBCUs -- basically, as we are looking at how to -- and we are going to expand this program, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you the details on that when we land -- we need university partners in the United States in order to move forward with this exchange program, and HBCUs are going to be a part of that process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a dialogue with them as well as public universities and other private universities in the United States, and we feel it\xe2\x80\x99s important for HBCUs to be a part of exchange programs that bring Africans to study in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you -- topic of the HBCUs.\xc2\xa0 HBCUs in America are undergoing some major financial issues right now.\xc2\xa0 In the news recently, Howard University had financial issues.\xc2\xa0 Is the President and the administration aware of that -- is that some of the reason why there\xe2\x80\x99s a promotion of HBCUs with this event?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the domestic funding question -- a bit out of my lane -- what I can say is that when we do partner with universities like HBCUs in the United States, the U.S. government helps provide the resources necessary for them to be able to host exchange students.\xc2\xa0 So we would work with HBCUs and other universities so that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing additional support to carry out this exchange program.\xc2\xa0 But we can take the question on the HBCUs more broadly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You bet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t(Gaggle resumes.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 ...The University of Capetown is the location where Robert F. Kennedy gave the \xe2\x80\x9cripples of hope\xe2\x80\x9d speech -- 47 years ago, June 6th, 1966.\xc2\xa0 And it was in a time when it was only a couple of years after Nelson Mandela\xe2\x80\x99s sensing that the Apartheid regime was entrenched, and it was really a shot in the arm to young people and to those who were opposing Apartheid.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the President will certainly reference that in his remarks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think it speaks to the fact that you have the extraordinary movement that emerged within South Africa by Nelson Mandela and others, but also that even though U.S. government policy, frankly, did not effectively and appropriately align with the anti-Apartheid movement for far too long, that there were many individuals in the United States who stood with those who wanted a better South Africa, and wanted to see equality between the races.\xc2\xa0 And Robert F. Kennedy was a part of that legacy, as was so many other people who joined the divestment movement and other things.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we are not joined by the Kennedys on this trip, but we very much feel the spirit of Robert F. Kennedy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why the University of Capetown is such a good venue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to a little bit of history with these Africa trips with Presidents.\xc2\xa0 Some in the African American community are very upset that President Obama did not take a delegation like Bill Clinton did to South Africa.\xc2\xa0 Ron Brown\xe2\x80\x99s widow -- late Ron Brown, Commerce Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Jesse Jackson, then-Maryland Congressman, Kwiesi Mfume, Bob Johnson -- I mean, just a whole host of business, congressional, just -- black leaders.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President bring those leaders?\xc2\xa0 Or not those leaders, but a delegation of black leaders this time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Number one, we\xe2\x80\x99re creating opportunities for people to participate in these events, including in the business events in Tanzania and South Africa.\xc2\xa0 We didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a delegation abroad -- we obviously have a full plane here -- but what I would say is we met with African American leaders in the planning and preparations for this trip, so we were able to speak, for instance, to Mayor Young, Ambassador Young, to Reverend Sharpton, to Martin Luther King, Jr. III.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMany African leaders were able to provide their -- African American leaders, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, were able to provide their input and share their experience, which helped inform preparation for the trip.\xc2\xa0 We also met with the many members of the diaspora community in the United States.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo their views informed much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, for instance, we have a Doing Business in Africa initiative that is focused on promoting trade and investment in Africa, but that also includes finding ways to connect small businesses in the United States, including African American-owned small businesses, with markets and counterparts in Africa as well.\xc2\xa0 So we do want to be building those connections.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of delegation, what we focused on were bringing members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team, his U.S. trade representative, his head of the Ex-Im Bank, his head of OPIC, so that we can move forward with the type of dialogue that will lead to greater trade and investment, and that will be represented at different business meetings.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re also bringing business leaders to South Africa and to Tanzania for meetings with the President and his team, and I think that sends a signal of how much promise we see in Africa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Patrick didn\xe2\x80\x99t come.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.
