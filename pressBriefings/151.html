Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:57 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right, good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I do not have any remarks at the top, so we can go straight to your questions. \xc2\xa0Josh, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with this threat received by the schools in L.A. that caused a shutdown this morning. \xc2\xa0What can you tell us, if anything, about that threat? \xc2\xa0And has the President been engaged with school officials or other public officials in California this morning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Josh, I can tell you that the President has been informed of a decision that was made by local authorities in Los Angeles, based on information that they had received. \xc2\xa0Josh, I do think this illustrates something that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand, which is that ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s local first responders who are responsible for taking the lead and protecting their communities. \xc2\xa0After all, these professionals are most aware of the unique characteristics of their community, and understand what factors will influence the best way to protect the community. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is true when there\xe2\x80\x99s a natural disaster, and we talk about the role that the federal government has in supporting local officials who are responsible for the response. \xc2\xa0This is also true when talking about strengthening relationships between local communities and local law enforcement; that the role of the federal government is to support those conversations where necessary. \xc2\xa0But the President convened this Task Force on 21st Century Policing, where we had law enforcement experts, legal experts, academics and others come together around a set of recommendations that are then, and have been, shared with local law enforcement agencies across the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThose recommendations cannot be imposed on local law enforcement agencies, but rather we can use our resources in the federal government to draw on the expertise of people all across the country, and share that information with local authorities. \xc2\xa0But ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s local authorities who are responsible for deciding how best those recommendations can be implemented in their community. \xc2\xa0And I think you have another example of the important role that state and local law enforcement and first responders have in protecting communities across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Officials in New York received what they\xe2\x80\x99re describing is essentially the same threat, and quickly determined it was a hoax and decided not to close the schools down. \xc2\xa0So does the White House feel that the decision that was made by authorities in Los Angeles was appropriate? \xc2\xa0And is there any federal guidance that\xe2\x80\x99s given to schools about -- you know, you get threats all the time, here are the ones where you need to take specific action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to stand here at this podium and second-guess the decisions that are made by local law enforcement officials in any community across the country. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, these individuals are making these decisions based on information that they\xe2\x80\x99ve received and based on their knowledge of what they believe is in the best interest of their community. \xc2\xa0And obviously they would know better than anyone else.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can tell you that as these local law enforcement agencies are making these decisions and considering these decisions, they do so with the support and assistance of federal agencies -- in this case, the FBI. \xc2\xa0I know that there have been conversations between law enforcement officials in southern California and the FBI in this matter. \xc2\xa0But again, this is ultimately a decision that was made by officials in Los Angeles.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing homeland security in the wake of Paris and California, the President has talked a number of times about not giving into fear and not allowing extremists to change the way that we live our lives. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk broadly about what advice the White House offers citizens about how to strike the balance, particularly around the holidays, between vigilance and resolve not to give into fears of terrorism. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, the most important thing in the mind of the President is keeping the American people safe. \xc2\xa0And we certainly do want to encourage everyone to be vigilant. \xc2\xa0That includes the citizens of our country. \xc2\xa0We encourage them, if they see something, they should say something. \xc2\xa0That advice, of course, continues to be operative. \xc2\xa0And we encourage local law enforcement and state officials to be vigilant as they go about their basic business of protecting the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, the President is resolute in his refusal to allow this country and our citizens to be terrorized. \xc2\xa0And there are several things that the President is doing about that. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the first is we have engaged this aggressive campaign to counter ISIL, to degrade and ultimately destroy that organization. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication, and should be an indication, to you and to the American public that the President and the federal government are cognizant of the risks and are taking appropriate steps to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0This is, after all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think that as people go about their business and go about the kind of holiday routines that many people rightly look forward to, that people can have confidence that our law enforcement professionals that are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week are actually doing the work that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to keep us safe. \xc2\xa0And they will remain vigilant, and they continue to use every element of the power and authority of the greatest country in the world to protect our citizens. \xc2\xa0And that is part of what should give people confidence that they can go about their holiday routine. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one other topic. \xc2\xa0I wanted to get your reaction to this new Saudi-led coalition that is going to be working against the Islamic State. \xc2\xa0Can you describe how that\xe2\x80\x99s going to work, overlapping significantly with the U.S.-led coalition? \xc2\xa0And does the U.S. have any concerns about having Saudi Arabia heading the operation, fueling the kind of Sunni-Shia tensions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen at play in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Josh, the first thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand is that this coalition that was announced by the Saudis was not solely directed at ISIL, but rather to extremist and terrorist threats that are threatening all the members of that coalition. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly broader than ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the second thing is -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say on a number of occasions, as recently as yesterday -- that we believe that there are additional steps and greater investments that can be made by members of our anti-ISIL coalition to fighting terrorism and speaking out, particularly when it comes to countering ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s online radicalization efforts. \xc2\xa0And I understand based on the way that this was described by the Saudis yesterday, that that is a central part of this particular coalition\xe2\x80\x99s activities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFinally, I would point out that the Saudis went to great lengths to also make clear that this is not a substitute or a replacement for the 65-member anti-ISIL coalition that was built and is being led by the United States of America. \xc2\xa0Saudi Arabia has made important contributions to that coalition effort, and we anticipate that they will continue to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a team of sanctions monitors issued a report today that said that the October 10th missile that Iran launched was in violation of the U.N. ban. \xc2\xa0Does this amp up the pressure for the United States to issue more sanctions on Iran? \xc2\xa0Or is that -- would such a move be seen as potentially complicating the nuclear deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Julie, I believe that the reference that you\xe2\x80\x99re making is to a document that is leaked from the U.N. this morning. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not going to get ahead of any announcements that are made by this panel of experts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would note, however, that the United States, through our Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, raised our concerns about this October 10th medium-range ballistic missile launch back on October 21st. \xc2\xa0And in raising those concerns, Ambassador Power described that launch as another clear violation of United Nations sanctions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it should be quite clear that this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been concerned about for a while. \xc2\xa0And we consider this to be a serious matter that undermines regional stability. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why the United States has raised this issue and pressed it so aggressively before the Security Council.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we also noted at the time is that a number of the individuals who were connected to that launch are already subject to significant sanctions by the United States. \xc2\xa0But I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional steps if our national security officials determine that additional sanctions would be useful in countering this activity. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would say that probably the most important thing, however, that can be done is for other countries to respond to the call that the United States has repeatedly made to more intensively focus our efforts on countering Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of things that we can do that relate to intelligence sharing, in terms of stopping the flow of some technology and contraband into Iran that we know is used to advance their ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I would note that this does underscore the significance of the historic international agreement that was reached earlier this year that will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0There are obvious concerns that people have, legitimately, about what role these kinds of tests could have in advancing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapons program. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to, in a verifiable way, determine that Iran is not, in fact, developing a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So at this point in time, are you any more hesitant to issue sanctions to respond to this kind of behavior because of the fear that it would jeopardize the nuclear deal? \xc2\xa0Or are you saying that sanctions are on the table just as they always are?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear from the beginning, the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was a high priority, but separate from the wide range of other concerns that we had with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, including their ballistic missile program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo like I said, if our national security professionals, including our sanctions experts at the Treasury Department, determine that additional sanctions would be useful in countering Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way of those sanctions moving forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll just note that I would anticipate that there are a number of people on Capitol Hill who are raising concerns about the development of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, and suggesting that the U.S. government -- specifically the Obama administration -- should take steps to counter it. \xc2\xa0Well, one thing that they could do is they could actually confirm Adam Szubin, who is the financial expert at the Treasury Department, who has been blocked for more than a year by Republicans -- many of whom are complaining about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile program -- they are actually preventing the confirmation of the individual who would be responsible for imposing the sanctions against Iran and their ballistic missile program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I recognize that I keep coming up to this, but I think it is an indication of how central Mr. Szubin is to our counterterrorism strategy and to our strategy to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0That is why it is inexcusable for Republicans to, once again, continue to block the nomination of somebody that even they admit is eminently qualified for the job. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s served in both Democratic and Republican administrations. \xc2\xa0And they have no legitimate justification for why this financial expert is prevented from taking steps that we know would enhance the national security of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think it is an indication of just how petty their partisan agenda looks when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about issues as significant as, for example, countering Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Congress, with the budget deadline seeming on the horizon, that that horizon seems to be moving little by little, there\xe2\x80\x99s been discussions on the Hill of Republicans being able to lift the ban on crude oil exports in exchange for Democrats getting some of what they want on clean renewable energy. \xc2\xa0Is that something -- first of all, can you tell us how far that deal might be locked down, and would the White House consider a budget that includes both of those sides?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have seen the reporting on this that has further expanded since we discussed this issue even yesterday. \xc2\xa0However, at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on the ongoing negotiations on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99ll do is I\xe2\x80\x99ll just merely restate what opposition on this issue has been, which is that we oppose legislation that would require the lifting of the federal ban on crude oil in the United States. \xc2\xa0And our objections are primarily procedural. \xc2\xa0This is authority that is vested in the executive branch and we believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the authority to make the best decision. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s our position on the issue, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into sort of how this is being discussed or negotiated, or even if it\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed or negotiated in the context of the budget agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, over the weekend, Marco Rubio indicated on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d he would appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would reverse the ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s support for that decision is well-known, but would he use it as a litmus test for any vacancies in the Court for the remaining year of the administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, I think in the context particularly of his two nominees to the Supreme Court, both Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan, the President has been quite clear about the kind of criteria that he uses in nominating highly qualified individuals to the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s been clear that there are litmus tests, but I think for insight into how the President makes those decisions, I think you can carefully consider the experience and r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s and, at this point, frankly, performance of the two justices that he has appointed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Those two justices, they were in the majority for both the decision against the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 and the more recent decision against the state marriage bans this year. \xc2\xa0So should we read their appointment as a confirmation that there is a litmus test that the President considers with regard to same-sex marriage in his judicial appointees?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read it that way. \xc2\xa0I would just read it as that their approach to resolving these issues in the legal system is consistent with the way the President believes those decisions should be made by lifetime appointees to the highest court in the land.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the President aware of Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s comments and his aim to reverse the Supreme Court decision? \xc2\xa0And does he object to it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is aware of his specific comments, but if he were informed of them, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident he would not be surprised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJustin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to go back on the CR quickly and that discussion again of kind of a short-term, couple-day extension. \xc2\xa0I know that the President signed one of those already. \xc2\xa0Is there a point of no return at which the President is actually going to say, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing this anymore -- you said days not weeks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There is. \xc2\xa0Hopefully we will not reach it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you want to elaborate on when that is? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Is it Christmas day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I mean, I think I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe it more than I already have, which is that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been given ample time to reach a bipartisan budget agreement that is clearly within the interests of our economy and consistent with the need to adequately fund both our national security and economic priorities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what they need to do. \xc2\xa0They have been given ample time to do it. \xc2\xa0And as you point out, they\xe2\x80\x99ve even been given a few days of extra time to do it. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for this deal not being completed here pretty quick, and hopefully that will get done. \xc2\xa0I mean, based on the reporting from all of you, it does appear that they are on track to announce an agreement here relatively soon. \xc2\xa0That obviously would be welcome news, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if they needed a couple extra days?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve always been clear about -- that if there was an agreement reached and if there were just a couple of days that were needed for the legislative process to play itself out, that the President would agree to a short-term extension to give Congress the time they needed to pass an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s already been reached.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also been reported -- and I know we\xe2\x80\x99re venturing into the territory that we just went where you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on rumors -- but the repeal of the Cadillac tax will be included in the omnibus. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a little bit stronger even than on some of these other topics. \xc2\xa0When I asked you about it last week, you said you\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly oppose\xe2\x80\x9d the notion for repealing the Cadillac tax, and it would also kind of take a big blow to the President\xe2\x80\x99s argument that his signature health care achievement saves the government money. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is that kind of a cross that you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to die on on this omnibus?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I won\xe2\x80\x99t speculate about how it is included in the ongoing budget talks, or even how it\xe2\x80\x99s being included in the budget talks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur steadfast opposition to the repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax remains in effect, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been our position for years now. \xc2\xa0And I recognize that that is a source of some irritation, even among some people who are broadly supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut our view on this is rooted in the fact that we know that the application of the Cadillac tax would have the effect of giving employers an incentive to raise wages. \xc2\xa0That, right now, a fancy health care plan -- even one that is excessively larded with benefits that, in some cases, people never even use -- is a way for employers to offer compensation that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually benefit in full their employees.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is an incentive that\xe2\x80\x99s built in here to ensure that people have access to high-quality health insurance, but also giving employers an incentive to actually turn their attention to raising wages. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been a central priority of our economic strategy since the President\xe2\x80\x99s first day in office. \xc2\xa0And so this is broadly consistent with that strategy, and broadly consistent with the strategy of the people who generally support the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an area where we do have -- that is the subject of some disagreement. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s also why I feel confident in saying to you that we continue to strongly oppose the repeal of the so-called Cadillac tax.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last thing, quickly. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry met with President Putin today in Russia. \xc2\xa0I know you did a preview yesterday and so I won\xe2\x80\x99t ask you to repeat kind of all that stuff, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there are any new updates on Syria, the Russia-Turkey relationship, or the Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I was walking out here, I know that Secretary Kerry and President Putin were wrapping up their meeting and prepared to have a news conference in Moscow to discuss their meeting. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d direct your attention out there for the latest update on their meeting. \xc2\xa0That way I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to repeat all the things I said yesterday. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the no-export ban, I know you said that the President opposes lifting it, but would the President veto a funding bill that lifts it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve avoided sort of walking through all the things that we would consider or veto, or just be annoyed with but sign anyway -- (laughter) -- in terms of the inclusion in the omnibus. \xc2\xa0Our position on the export ban is pretty clear. \xc2\xa0We do not support legislation that would lift it. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also acknowledged that an omnibus bill is going to have to be a compromise proposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be things that will be included in the omnibus bill that we don\xe2\x80\x99t support. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the lifting of the export ban will be among them, but our position on this is pretty clear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a different topic, our latest poll shows that support for Donald Trump increased since he called for a ban on Muslims. \xc2\xa0A majority of Republicans and 36 percent of the public overall support his proposal. \xc2\xa0How do you explain this level of support for an idea that you\xe2\x80\x99ve said should disqualify him from being President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly is a principle and a value statement that runs in direct conflict to not just the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities, but also the values that are central to the founding of this nation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis nation was founded by people who were fleeing persecution and looking for a place where they could freely practice their religion. \xc2\xa0This is basic to what it means to be an American. \xc2\xa0And I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for the polls; there are some sophisticated and articulate individuals who work for ABC who can do the polling analysis.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut all I can say from here is that it is quite clear to me that those kind of comments, and, in some cases, those policy positions that are shared by some of the Republican candidates for President -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Mr. Trump alone, but other people in his party who are advocating the kinds of things that stand in stark contrast to the basic founding values of this country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing. \xc2\xa0It certainly is divisive. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a little cynical. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I continue to have confidence does not reflect the values of the vast majority of Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And does the President plan to watch the debate tonight?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as some of your colleagues know, the President has another important engagement this evening that will prevent him from -- (laughter) -- spending as much time in front of the television this evening as he ordinarily would. \xc2\xa0But I know the President is very much looking forward to this evening\xe2\x80\x99s festivities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on your comments about Donald Trump, was the President responding to Donald Trump in some of the things he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about, during his remarks today? \xc2\xa0Was that a response of sorts to \xe2\x80\x9cTrumpism\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, I think as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, the comments that you heard from the President today do stand in stark contrast to the rhetoric and divisiveness that will most surely be on display on the debate stage tonight in Las Vegas on your network. \xc2\xa0But the things that the President talked about today are also firmly in line with the kind of vision for the country that the President has long given voice to. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s because of his success in advocating and fighting for those values, and articulating them in a way that has attracted the strong support of Democrats and Republicans in the context of an election in 2008 and an election in 2012 that the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be an advocate for those basic values are the reason that he is sitting in the office that he\xe2\x80\x99s sitting in today and I\xe2\x80\x99m standing at the podium that I\xe2\x80\x99m standing at right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the President went out of his way to describe these values. \xc2\xa0These are the kinds of things the President has long fought for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And apparently in the last several minutes -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this qualifies as breaking news. \xc2\xa0Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s something you expected, but Senator McCain is introducing legislation that would require DHS to review social media and public databases in foreign background checks. \xc2\xa0Is that a concept that the White House opposes? \xc2\xa0Is willing to look at? \xc2\xa0Might support? \xc2\xa0How would you describe that? \xc2\xa0Because as we were discussing yesterday, it just sort of -- I guess it strains the capacity for the American people to understand why businesses would look at Facebook pages when they\xe2\x80\x99re considering hiring employees and yet the federal government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at Facebook pages and the social media content when it comes to accepting people into the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess the first thing, Jim, and just as a factual matter, that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. \xc2\xa0The Department of Homeland Security has been clear that there are a number of pilot programs that have been implemented for over a year now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Pilot programs would not be across the board, though, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be across the board -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re pilot programs. \xc2\xa0But they are part of an effort by the Department of Homeland Security to consider the best way to factor that kind of information into a background check. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Homeland Security has been, at the direct order of the President of the United States, has been working with the State Department to review the K-1 visa program. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that part of that review is to consider ways to incorporate the use of social media vetting in their screening programs. \xc2\xa0So I think what I will do is we\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the experts to determine the best way to strengthen the security of our screening programs. \xc2\xa0That is, after all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority. \xc2\xa0And they will be able to best assess the optimal way to incorporate the review of, for example, social media postings in that screening process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so going with what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, so it\xe2\x80\x99s already within the authority of the Department of Homeland Security to do this? \xc2\xa0In other words, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need legislation in order to mandate this to occur? \xc2\xa0Could the President, via an executive order, direct the Department of Homeland Security across the board to look at social media when it comes to accepting newcomers into the country, whether they be through refugee programs or other programs?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Jim, the other thing to keep in mind here is that if there are members of Congress that have some new ideas for work they believe the Department of Homeland Security should do, ostensibly that is paired with an increase in the kind of resources that would be necessary to fulfill those work requests. \xc2\xa0Obviously if Senator McCain were under the view that this was important enough for him to pass legislation on, then surely he would believe that this would be important enough to fund. \xc2\xa0But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the entirety of his proposal and so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly how he has factored that into his proposal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does the President have that authority? \xc2\xa0Could he tell the Department of Homeland Security, look at social media?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why any specific legislation would be required to take a step like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding also that within any moment now, or any day now, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get new guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security in terms of a new terror alert system or revamped terror alert system, or changes to the terror alert system. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything you can offer in terms of a preview. \xc2\xa0I know you may not want to steal their thunder if they\xe2\x80\x99re announcing this tomorrow or whatever, but what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of the old color-coded program that did get people\xe2\x80\x99s attention, although it was mocked from time to time -- when is it a yellow, when is it an orange, and so forth? \xc2\xa0You do notice more \xe2\x80\x9csee something, say something\xe2\x80\x9d signs these days, it seems, since Paris and California. \xc2\xa0Do we need more of those signs? \xc2\xa0I guess, what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts? \xc2\xa0Because I would assume he would have some. \xc2\xa0Has he had some input into this process in terms of what he would like to see? \xc2\xa0What can you tell us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can tell you that the color-coded terror threat system that was put in place in the previous administration was discarded in the early days of this administration in favor of a different alert system. \xc2\xa0And the Department of Homeland Security has been looking, for at least several months now, at ways that that current reformed system could be made even more effective. \xc2\xa0And the idea is that the system should be able to incorporate additional information that could be useful if shared with the public. \xc2\xa0And so the challenge that DHS has been grappling with is how to essentially codify this system to incorporate reforms that would allow for more effective and direct communication with the public. \xc2\xa0So this is something they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on and I would anticipate that there will be some reforms and adjustments to this program that will be announced here in the next few days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to belabor this, but has the President had some input into this? \xc2\xa0Has he said, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see and that sort of thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I believe that the President has had a discussion with the Secretary of Homeland Security about the need for these kinds of reforms, but I think the President has a lot of confidence in the experts at the Department of Homeland Security to orient these programs in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the national security interests of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to ask about TPP. \xc2\xa0Speaker Ryan sounded a bit more optimistic this morning about the prospects for a vote next year than Leader McConnell did. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does the White House view Speaker Ryan as a partner in getting TPP passed next year? \xc2\xa0And has the President had any conversations recently with the Speaker about advancing that piece of legislation next year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jordan, the White House was able to work effectively with both Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan earlier this summer in passing Trade Promotion Authority legislation. \xc2\xa0Speaker Ryan, of course, was then the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t serve in the august position that he currently holds. \xc2\xa0But he was an effective partner in advancing that legislation earlier this summer, and we would envision a process of working closely with the Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate to try to advance congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was recently completed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI will say that our view continues to be that our argument has been strengthened by the fact that we now have a deal for Congress to consider. \xc2\xa0Previously, we were making the argument that Republicans in Congress should entrust the Democratic President to go and negotiate this agreement, and that included reaching a 60-vote threshold knowing that we had the strong opposition of a substantial majority of Democrats and Republicans in both Houses of Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe situation now is somewhat different. \xc2\xa0Now we actually have a specific agreement for Congress to consider and they have the details of 18,000 tax cuts that they can dig through. \xc2\xa0There are now a lot of reasons to be strongly supportive of this agreement. \xc2\xa0And now that we have essentially a predicate for people who have previously supported the ability of the administration to negotiate this agreement, that should add some momentum to our ability to pass this. \xc2\xa0Because of the passage of Trade Promotion Authority, there is a more clearly defined legislative track or legislative path for this agreement through both Houses, which should speed passage. \xc2\xa0And that includes no longer needing to meet a 60-vote threshold in the Senate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we have some built-up momentum behind this. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic that this is something that can and should get done in a timely fashion. \xc2\xa0Now, there obviously will be ample time for members of Congress to consider the details of this agreement. \xc2\xa0This was one of the sticking points in trying to advance trade promotion authority legislation, was members of Congress clamoring to see all of the available details. \xc2\xa0And that clamor has now subsided that we have put the final agreement online for everyone to consider. \xc2\xa0And I assume that part of the reason that that clamor has died down is it\xe2\x80\x99s now obvious how significant the benefits are. \xc2\xa0So we continue to be optimistic that this is something that Congress can and should do in a timely fashion. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll work closely with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell to get it done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President spoken with either of those leaders about setting -- the preliminary talks about setting the groundwork for a vote? \xc2\xa0And has he communicated in any way with Leader McConnell about his remarks about not sending the bill up next year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific congressional conversations to tell you about as it relates to this specific matter. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that the White House has been in regular touch with Capitol Hill about the agreement, and I can assure you that Ambassador Froman\xe2\x80\x99s office has been in close touch with Capitol Hill about approving this agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team here at the White House met with business leaders who are quite enthusiastic about seeing prompt legislative action to approve the agreement and move down the track of implementing it so that American businesses and American workers can begin reaping the significant benefits.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, is the White House aware of threats against any other school districts in the U.S.?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Margaret, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific threat information to share with you from here. \xc2\xa0Again, if the intelligence community or the Department of Homeland Security determines that there is threat information that should be shared with the American public, then they will do so. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the federal Homeland Security officials and federal law enforcement officials are in close touch with school districts and local officials in communities all across the country just as a matter of course. \xc2\xa0And we value that relationship because in some cases there can be federal resources and federal expertise that can be brought to bear to assist local authorities as they assess information that they may have received, or work to determine the appropriate response to those threats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on the specific case, since the situation is ongoing out in L.A. \xc2\xa0But broadly speaking, what does it signify here that an email can shut down one of the largest school districts in the United States? \xc2\xa0That level of fear and the impact it\xe2\x80\x99s had is pretty significant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what is significant here is the challenge that local officials face in remaining vigilant based on the threats that they are aware of and in some cases have received themselves, while also making sure that they are steadfast in refusing to be terrorized. \xc2\xa0And this is why the administration is so conscientious about ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to support local authorities as they consider these kinds of threats, and as they consider steps that they should take in response to them. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, this is a decision that is best made and rightly made by local officials who know and understand their community the best.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when you\xe2\x80\x99re emphasizing \xe2\x80\x9clocal,\xe2\x80\x9d are you signaling that this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a federal matter in terms of terror concerns in terms of a higher threat level here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that -- just as a factual matter, this is a decision that was made by local officials. \xc2\xa0But there certainly is an important role for the federal government -- in this case, the FBI -- to play in supporting local officials as they consider this threat information, as they evaluate the significance of it, and as they determine what steps need to be taken to ensure the safety of the public. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, when it comes to making the decision, it\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by local officials. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This week -- I mean, if you put it in the context of this week what we expect to hear from the President, what we have heard from the President in terms of what seems to be an effort to reassure Americans, it does appear that at this level the White House has recognized that there is a certain level of concern about national security that seems to be trumping so many other issues that are pressing right now. \xc2\xa0How do you see that? \xc2\xa0Should national security be the number-one concern among Americans right now? \xc2\xa0Because if you look at the polls, it\xe2\x80\x99s really kind of rocketing to the top, certainly for politicians out there running for office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTHE PRESIDENT: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President touched on this in his address to the nation in the Oval Office, where he noted that the attacks in Paris and the terror attack that we saw in San Bernardino both literally and figuratively hits close to home. \xc2\xa0And it, of course, raises natural and understandable concerns that people might have about the threat posed by violent extremists. \xc2\xa0That is understandable. \xc2\xa0We see a similar reaction in the aftermath of some of these mass shootings. \xc2\xa0And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in Colorado Springs or in Oregon, or even in Charleston. \xc2\xa0And that kind of, sort of visceral human response I think is a natural one. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an understandable one. \xc2\xa0And we certainly do want to encourage vigilance.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut at the same time, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to recognize that the chief aim of the violent extremists that are operating -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s overseas or here in the United States -- is to try to terrorize people and to instill fear in them, and to provoke an overreaction. \xc2\xa0That is their most effective weapon. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has, again -- time and again reiterated his commitment to ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give into fear, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to give into terrorism, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to allow the actions of violent extremists -- whether they\xe2\x80\x99re motivated by a perversion of Islam or something else -- to instill fear all across the countryside.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to vigilant, because we surely are. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked quite a bit in the last few days about the significant and serious steps that this administration has taken to both countering violent extremism and, in the case of ISIL, building an international coalition to destroy them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about some basic human emotions here. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that emotions are going to factor into this response. \xc2\xa0But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but it does illustrate why it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we not give in to fear.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today? \xc2\xa0He spoke passionately about immigration, about refugees. \xc2\xa0And specifically, he made an analogy between -- or he compared the Syrian refugees today to the Jews fleeing World War II. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s very powerful imagery. \xc2\xa0What is the President doing in terms of perhaps reviewing the number of Syrian refugees that this country is going to be accepting, since it is a relatively small fraction of the number around the world? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just some 10,000 or so. \xc2\xa0Is that number going to go up?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, 10,000 did reflect a significant increase from the levels that were admitted to this country before. \xc2\xa0I think the other part of this -- there are two other factors here that are relevant. \xc2\xa0The first is -- three, actually. \xc2\xa0The first is that the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to this response effort. \xc2\xa0There are more than $4 billion -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re now approaching $5 billion in assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s been provided by the United States to countries in the region that are trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of Syrians fleeing violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe other thing that the administration has been doing is leading an international effort to try to bring an end to the political turmoil inside of Syria that has contributed to so much violence and instability in that country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s that violence and instability that people from Syria are fleeing. \xc2\xa0So trying to address that root cause is a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen that ISIL has tried to capitalize on this instability to essentially carry out a reign of terror against a substantial number -- hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. \xc2\xa0And the President has been vigilant about building an international coalition to destroy that terrorist organization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the response has been robust on the part of the United States. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the preeminent role that the United States has historically and continues to play in the world. \xc2\xa0It is in part at least motivated by the moral questions that are raised by all of this, and that moral question is essentially -- we\xe2\x80\x99re blessed with so many resources in this country, what are we going to do to respond to our fellow human beings who are in need? \xc2\xa0And I think our response to that question has been quite forceful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But precisely to that point, when the President was talking about the U.S. being a haven, literally, for people fleeing war, and the White House had said at least 10,000 refugees -- is that number going to go up? \xc2\xa0Are we going to take more Syrians in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there is a process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway at the State Department. \xc2\xa0It, of course, has to be balanced against our national security interests and the need to protect the safety and security of the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President has talked about how a well-functioning immigration system does enhance our national security system. \xc2\xa0And it certainly contributes to the strength of our country overall, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President has strong supported. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements about a higher number at this point, but there are certainly a range of other things that the United States can do and has done to respond to this situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the other relevant statistic here, Margaret -- and you know this as well as anyone -- that when it comes to the U.N. refugee resettlement program, that the United States actually resettles more of those refugees through that U.N. program than every other country in the world combined. \xc2\xa0And again, I think that is consistent with both our values as a country and a response to the moral questions that are central to all of this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0If I could just follow up just real quickly on something Margaret was asking about. \xc2\xa0Has that $5 billion been set aside, or has it been distributed already? \xc2\xa0And where can we get sort of a tick-tock of where that money went?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is something that the State Department can follow up with you on. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get somebody here to follow up with you. \xc2\xa0These are payments that, over the last several years, the United States has paid to the U.N., to other humanitarian organizations, and in some cases, directly to other countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Turkey --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, other countries that are housing hundreds of thousands and, in some cases, millions of Syrians fleeing violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Gotcha. \xc2\xa0I want to stay on dollars. \xc2\xa0The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates tomorrow for the first time since 2006, maybe a quarter of a point. \xc2\xa0I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to impact markets, but I wonder if you could talk about the psychology behind rate hikes. \xc2\xa0People, and consumer confidence in particular, is impacted -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the White House or the Fed. \xc2\xa0I just would like to know if raising the rate by just a quarter of a point, is that really -- is that sort of an admission that the economy is really fragile? \xc2\xa0Or is it a statement in and of itself that says, hey, listen, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to push this too hard because we\xe2\x80\x99re not secure in how strong the economy is right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking are entirely legitimate, but they\xe2\x80\x99re ones that are best directed to the Federal Reserve, because ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that are evaluating the health of the economy and making decisions about the appropriate level to peg the interest rate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs they make these decisions -- I know that in recent years the Fed has tried to embrace the responsibility that they have to try to communicate clearly with the public about what factors are influencing their decisions. \xc2\xa0So as they meet later this week, regardless of what decision they make, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get some greater clarity from the Fed about what factors are influencing their decision.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI do think, though, that if you look at essentially the basics of our economy -- and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s job creation, or consumer confidence, or economic growth -- the economy is stronger than it\xe2\x80\x99s been in quite some time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of job creation, yesterday you mentioned I think it was Westinghouse, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken -- were talking about green energy and developing economies overseas, for example. \xc2\xa0And you mentioned that they may be able to, or may have on the books four nuclear plants -- was it China, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that right? \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that they should also be developing more nuclear technologies here and establishing more nuclear power plants here? \xc2\xa0Because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any, I think, domestically since like the \xe2\x80\x9870s, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There was a permit that was issued earlier in the administration for a nuclear power plant here in the United States. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where that project stands, to be honest with you, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the Department of Energy can give you an update on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe reason that I highlighted that specific example is that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an American company, Westinghouse Electric, that is getting business in China because of China\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to reducing carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good for the American economy. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s good for American workers here in the United States that we can essentially export some of this technology and this work from the United States to China. \xc2\xa0And it is a reason that the President is optimistic about this Paris agreement, not just because of the impact that it will have on the health of our planet, but because of the impact it will have on the health of our economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen it comes to the domestic economy, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously made significant commitments in the context of the Paris agreement. \xc2\xa0And it will challenge the United States to make some decisions about the kinds of investments in renewable energy that we want to make here. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such a dramatic increase, for example, in the production of solar energy, that -- I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s actually up twenty-fold in the United States since the President took office. \xc2\xa0When it comes to power generation from wind, that\xe2\x80\x99s tripled since the President has been in office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think that is an indication that those early investments are, again, good for the planet, good for us in terms of trying to meet the commitments that were made in the context of Paris, but also good for the economy. \xc2\xa0These are good manufacturing jobs. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the building of wind turbines or the installation of solar panels. \xc2\xa0These are good, middle-class jobs, and certainly are an important source of economic opportunity for workers here in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last thing I want to ask you about, former Secretary of State Clinton giving a big policy speech over in Minneapolis. \xc2\xa0I was sort of doing a tick-tock of where she differs from the President on foreign policy, and there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be a great deal of difference. \xc2\xa0And so there have been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been some criticism, people say it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cObama 2.0\xe2\x80\x9d if she becomes President. \xc2\xa0Is that an accurate reflection from your vantage point? \xc2\xa0And is that a good thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would first observe that having served as the President\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary of State during his first term in office, that I\xe2\x80\x99m not particularly surprised to hear that even after your careful review that you\xe2\x80\x99ve determined that their approach to a large number of foreign policy issues is at least similar. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the same time, I would leave it to the campaign to describe to you exactly what kind of policy agendas she is putting forward. \xc2\xa0And she certainly has a well-earned reputation as an independent thinker, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are probably some areas where she would disagree with the President. \xc2\xa0But to hear that, based on your analysis, that their approach is generally similar, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised to hear that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I understand that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to second guess any decisions from the podium. \xc2\xa0You said, in answer to the first question, that the President has been informed of the decision made in Los Angeles. \xc2\xa0And normally, in situations like this, you talk about sort of getting briefed on the threat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there was an analysis of the level of threat, whether they thought one existed. \xc2\xa0And the other thing that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that you often do in these situations is he\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to get updated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to update the President on this specific issue, that he will be updated by his national security team.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for updates, as sometimes you say he sometimes does?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that in the past. \xc2\xa0I think in this case I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll update him if they determine that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that because the FBI is in close touch with local officials on the ground in Los Angeles. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team here at the White House continues to monitor the situation. \xc2\xa0So it certainly is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re tracking here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President himself has acknowledged sort of the unease that\xe2\x80\x99s in the country, and this is the kind of thing that happens. \xc2\xa0And I just wondered, given the level of anxiety and the cost that\xe2\x80\x99s involved, the logistics that\xe2\x80\x99s involved, the resources that are diverted when you have a situation like this -- to shut down a school system is huge -- is there a reassessment of the federal role in a situation like this, even if you understand that the ultimate decision is going to be made on a local level? \xc2\xa0Is there any kind of reassessment or any thought of a reassessment of the role that the federal government plays in coordination with local or state officials?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m -- nothing specific that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of right now with regard to a reassessment of that role, because I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that in situations like -- that local officials are ultimately responsible for making the decision that they believe, based on their knowledge of the community, makes the most sense and is consistent with their judgment about the best way to protect the community. \xc2\xa0And the federal government certainly has a responsibility to support local officials as they make those decisions and as they implement them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware at this point of any formal effort that\xe2\x80\x99s underway to reevaluate that relationship. \xc2\xa0But if a reevaluation like that takes place, we\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely let you know. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And given what has happened today -- and again, this is sort of top of the line and in all the headlines, and is dominating a lot of the cable news coverage -- anything else you can tell us about the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans for Thursday, what we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to hear from him? \xc2\xa0Why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to the National Counterterrorism Center?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President typically, shortly before the holiday break, will convene a formal meeting with his homeland security team, including members of the intelligence community, law enforcement officials, and, obviously, national security officials here at the White House to discuss the threat picture for the country in advance of the holidays. \xc2\xa0And this is something the President has done on an annual basis, and he\xe2\x80\x99s doing it again this year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what is different about this year -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s done this in the past -- but what\xe2\x80\x99s different this year is that the President will travel to the National Counterterrorism Center where he\xe2\x80\x99ll get this briefing at that location instead of in the Situation Room. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that it will change who the participants are in the meeting, but it certainly will give the President an opportunity to get an updated threat assessment based on the hard work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done by our intelligence community and by law enforcement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is going there mostly optics or something that you hope will get more attention? \xc2\xa0Or is there something specific he wants to see there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I would suspect that it will get more attention because the President is traveling there, but it also will give the President an opportunity to thank the men and women in our intelligence community that, based on their job description, don\xe2\x80\x99t get noticed a lot. \xc2\xa0And these are people who often will have to be away from their families over the holidays because they\xe2\x80\x99re working, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always on duty 24/7 to protect the country. \xc2\xa0And the President relies on the information they obtain to make important national security decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd by traveling to the National Counterterrorism Center, the President will have an opportunity to thank those patriotic men and women who serve in our intelligence community and play a vital role in keeping us all safe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRichard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0You probably know Canada is expected -- welcoming up to 25,000 refugees, Syrian refugees until February. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re just shy of 1,000 at the moment. \xc2\xa0Things have been going very smoothly. \xc2\xa0In Quebec and Ontario, they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving health care coverage as soon as they get there. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re very warmly welcomed. \xc2\xa0What do you say -- the Canadian example a way to reassure Americans, and states in particular, who have said openly that they refuse to welcome Syrian refugees? \xc2\xa0Would it be an example to -- would Canada serve as an example to reassure Americans that it can be done securely?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Richard, I think when discussing the relationship between the United States and Canada, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for me and for other people who have stood behind this podium to note the values that we share in common. \xc2\xa0And I think that the response that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Canadian people and the Canadian government is consistent with the kinds of values that are held dear in the United States of America as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd obviously the response from the Canadians to respond with this gesture of generosity to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of fellow human beings who are in a pretty desperate situation, again, I think is a good representation of the kinds of values that are central to this country as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Canadian immigration officials have said that the suspicious case, they\xe2\x80\x99ve found some and they\xe2\x80\x99ve put them aside and they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with it. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to do this in a secure way and protect the population.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of insight into the process that Canadian officials are using, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised to hear that Canadian officials are prioritizing the safety and security of the Canadian homeland as they implement this program. \xc2\xa0Obviously, that\xe2\x80\x99s what the United States does as well. \xc2\xa0And given the significant undefended border between our two countries, those kinds of security precautions are something that are in the interest of citizens in both our countries. \xc2\xa0So obviously what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is important from a national security standpoint, but they\xe2\x80\x99re responding to the same kinds of values that many Americans believe are really important, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPhillip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Ahead of the Republican debate tonight, are you in any way worried that the reputation of the United States as a whole could be hurt further by proposals -- more policy proposals from Donald Trump that have been deemed racist by many Europeans, by many people abroad? \xc2\xa0Do you think the reputation of the U.S. as a whole could be hurt further by things that he might say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Phillip, I think in general we have heard from many Republican candidates, not just Mr. Trump, rhetoric that is offensive and divisive, and deployed to cynically benefit their political campaigns. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the kinds of values that, frankly, should come before someone\xe2\x80\x99s own narrow political ambition. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite outspoken in condemning some of the comments from a variety of Republican politicians. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard an opportunity to hear from the President in a variety of settings where he has laid out his vision of how our nation\xe2\x80\x99s values should inform the foreign policy decisions that are made in this country. \xc2\xa0But, ultimately, the American people are going to have to decide what kind of leadership they want. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s their responsibility, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that our system works. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese values and these policy decisions are the subject of legitimate political debate. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting somehow that the candidates should be silenced in one way or another, but I do think that our country\xe2\x80\x99s interests would be better served if those candidates were more committed to ensuring that their rhetoric actually reflected the true values of our country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The policy proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States has been deemed racist and even fascist by editorial writers, by experts abroad. \xc2\xa0Are those terms that -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily agree with -- but would you reject those outright?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Phillip, over the course of the last week or so, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had ample opportunity to make my views quite well-known on the comments from Mr. Trump and from others. \xc2\xa0So those views reflect the position of the administration, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to consider the comments that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from me as an accurate reflection of our posture here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFrancesca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, back on the refugees. \xc2\xa0Ben Carson released a seven-point plan today that he says would protect America and also it deals with the war against ISIS. \xc2\xa0And one of the points of his plan was that the United States should urge its allies and partners in the Middle East to engage in massive recruitment in training of Sunni Syrian men based in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, of Sunni Syrian male refugees in Jordan to establish a military force to destroy ISIS. \xc2\xa0And first and foremost -- I do have another question after that -- but first and foremost, do you know of any sort of ongoing effort like that to take the Syrian refugees that are in that area and recruit and train them to fight ISIS? \xc2\xa0And what would the administration think of such an effort?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there has already been an effort that the Department of Defense committed a substantial number of resources to, trying to train and equip moderate Syrian opposition fighters that didn\xe2\x80\x99t yield the kind of results that we would like to see.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we have said is that we do believe that our partners in the region can do more to contribute to our overall counter-ISIL effort, and we certainly would welcome additional contributions to that effort. \xc2\xa0In fact, Secretary Carter is traveling in the region over the course of this week, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident will be having some discussions both with his military commanders about what more the United States can do to contribute to that effort, but also meeting with the leaders of other countries, or at least senior officials in other countries to discuss what more they can contribute to our ongoing efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s significantly different. \xc2\xa0I do hear what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, but that seems to me significantly different than saying that we should mobilize the refugees that are in the refugee camps in the region, and train and equip them to fight ISIS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I haven\'t read Dr. Carson\xe2\x80\x99s program.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then the final thing was regarding -- you mentioned Canada and our shared border with Canada. \xc2\xa0He also suggested deploying the National Guard to the border with Canada and the southern border. \xc2\xa0And given your support in the past for the President\xe2\x80\x99s, I guess, own recommendations that maybe aren\xe2\x80\x99t directly affiliated with any sort of attack that\xe2\x80\x99s already happened, I was wondering what you thought about the idea of sending them to the borders to protect from something like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t seen his specific proposal. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the President is a strong advocate of border security. \xc2\xa0There have been more resources in terms of manpower and technology deployed to our border with Mexico than in any time in our history, and that is a testament to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this issue. \xc2\xa0There would be significantly more resources dedicated to our border had Republicans in Congress not blocked comprehensive immigration reform that would have actually made a historic investment in border security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if Dr. Carson is concerned about border security, then I encourage him to take it up with House Republicans who blocked an investment in border security that might address some of the problems that he claims to be trying to solve.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
