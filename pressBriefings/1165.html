EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any opening announcements or statements, so I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said in an interview today that the debt ceiling won\xe2\x80\x99t be raised without spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what he means by that?\xc2\xa0 Are these two separate issues like you have been saying, or one and the same?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President made clear and has made clear in the past is that we -- there are two urgent tasks that need to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 One, Congress has to vote to raise the ceiling on our debt.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an imperative that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be linked or held hostage to any other action because the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling -- those consequences would be catastrophic to the American economy, to the global economy and to America\xe2\x80\x99s creditworthiness internationally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are also moving with a great sense of urgency towards -- taking steps towards greater deficit reduction, through the speech the President gave the other day, and the process that he has asked the Vice President to oversee and leaders of Congress to appoint members to participate in where they can come together and begin to negotiate areas where we can agree to bring about further deficit reduction in a balanced way that can achieve the kind of results that we think are what America needs economically and for our future.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are both urgent, but they\'re not linked.\xc2\xa0 How this will play out remains to be seen, but both need to be done.\xc2\xa0 And with regards to the debt ceiling, it cannot be linked or held hostage to something that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass -- couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach consensus.\xc2\xa0 It has to be done.\xc2\xa0 All the leaders of Congress of both parties have said that, and we obviously share that sentiment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the one isn\xe2\x80\x99t contingent on the other?\xc2\xa0 It seemed in the interview like he was saying that he recognizes the relationship --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President was saying is that he recognizes that the -- that Republicans want more deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 He wants more deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 He wants it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 He also said that as in any compromise and any negotiation, he recognizes he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get 100 percent of what he wants or that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be his way only, and Republicans need to recognize that, which is how we ended up with an agreement last week on the funding for the 2011 budget.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that\'s the process that he -- a similar kind of process that he hopes that we\xe2\x80\x99ll see as we go forward with -- on the deficit-reduction track for the larger-picture issues that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if his condition now is that the deficit ceiling won\xe2\x80\x99t be raised without an agreement to cuts --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not his position at all.\xc2\xa0 His position is that the deficit ceiling must be raised -- absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the position of the Speaker of the House, the Senate Minority Leader, the Senate Majority Leader, the House Minority Leader, et cetera, et cetera -- all the major players in Congress -- which is fortunate because as we\xe2\x80\x99ve all said and as I know you know, if you talk to economists or businessmen or women, that there\xe2\x80\x99s simply too much at stake here to be playing around with the full faith and credit of the United States government.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat he is saying is that he recognizes that there is a great focus, as there should be, on the need for deficit reduction and building on the significant achievement of last week which was -- and voted on and passed into law yesterday the -- for the fiscal year 2011, the largest domestic non-defense discretionary spending cuts in history.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe Paul Ryan is a sincere person?\xc2\xa0 I mean, his comments in the public were very different than the comments when the reporters left the room, were very pointed in saying does he think -- you know, implying that Ryan was not serious about the deficit, he voted for two wars, that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 Is there a difference between what he said in public and what he said when we thought he was not in public?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Actually I think what he said in that session you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about and the things he\xe2\x80\x99s said in more public forums have been entirely consistent.\xc2\xa0 And you can\xe2\x80\x99t in one breath criticize him for being pointed in his comments about the House Republican budget plan in public and then say, my gosh, he was pointed and so different in private, because he is making clear that the visions are quite different.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe does believe that Chairman Ryan is absolutely sincere and that he believes that this is the right -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s the right path, the one he put forward is the right path for America.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President simply disagrees because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s balanced.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that we need to -- that the price of deficit reduction needs to be ending the guarantee, the health benefits that Medicare has provided our seniors, cutting energy -- clean energy investment by 70 percent, cutting education by 25 percent, cutting infrastructure by 30 percent -- and all so that we can not just reduce the deficit but so that we can extend tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans and give new tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a different vision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then -- and I think the point he\xe2\x80\x99s making is that there is more here than a goal of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a vision of government and what -- and the way our system should work and what America should look like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when he talked about those votes under the previous administration, he was making the point that that\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that this is more than -- this is not just about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 If it were just about deficit reduction, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wars.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- an entitlement, a brand new entitlement without paying for it.\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for two massive tax cuts without paying for them, or for the funding of two wars without paying for them, which is what happened in the first decade of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did it happen last night that those remarks were piped back into the press room?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a miscommunication, nothing more than that.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem, not an issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President embarrassed about anything that he said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or regret --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- might have clarified them differently if he had known they were for public distribution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He obviously -- that was meant to be a closed-press event.\xc2\xa0 He was taking questions from supporters.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing -- nothing he said that contradicts anything he said in public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In an interview yesterday, the Senate Majority Leader had raised some doubts as to whether the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan policy is going to be ultimately successful.\xc2\xa0 Did the Commander-in-Chief hear those remarks, and did he have any thought on them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he heard those remarks, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve only read the top line from the AP interview, but it looks as if the President, speaking about Libya, said that they are at a stalemate and -- but that he still believes Qaddafi will go.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, what his point was that the -- what he said, rather, was that the -- obviously the military conflict remains contentious and unresolved because what the NATO mission is -- NATO is fulfilling its mission which is to enforce the no-fly zone, enforce an arms embargo and provide civilian protection; it is not to win the war or decapitate the regime.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut all the other measures that the United States and its partners are taking are tightening the noose around Qaddafi, putting more pressure on Qaddafi, with the end goal of having him accept the fact that he can no longer rule legitimately in Libya, and that the Libyan people need to decide their future for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does he think, though, that Qaddafi is going to come to that realization or leave by force in some other way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it becomes increasingly clear when your assets are frozen, your capacities have become increasingly diminished, that you are -- your days are numbered in terms of your -- what exactly are you ruling over.\xc2\xa0 And that what we have seen, because the sanctions are targeted not just at Colonel Qaddafi and his family but members of his inner circle who are being identified in greater numbers every week, that there -- pressure is put on them to make an existential decision about who they want to be, whose side do they want to be on, the Libyan people\xe2\x80\x99s side or Colonel Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s side, a man who has lost all legitimacy in the eyes of the world and his people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that kind of pressure has led to defections already.\xc2\xa0 We hope and anticipate that it will lead to more defections, put more pressure on Colonel Qaddafi, and eventually lead to his stepping down from power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Q&amp;A last night the President said that he anticipates that Republicans will seek to kind of put policy issue riders on future budget-type bills.\xc2\xa0 So would he veto a deficit-reduction package that had unrelated social policy or environmental riders?\xc2\xa0 Because he did, in the end, have to accept some, as you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what might be on a bill that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been written or anything like that.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that his position on these issues was made pretty clear in the negotiations over the 2011 continuing resolution and -- because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that highly contentious social issues or ideological issues belong in budget bills.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to pre-negotiate something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even exist at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What time is he going to sign the 2011 budget bill -- today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, actually -- we can find out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will that be open, closed, photo --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any reaction to the CBO report that shows that the budget deal reduced government spending by $20-$25 billion, not the $38 billion number?\xc2\xa0 Have you seen that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have read reports of that.\xc2\xa0 My only reaction is that we worked together with members of Congress on a package that, by the numbers, Republicans and Democrats measured together in the negotiations, reduced spending by roughly $38.5 billion.\xc2\xa0 And there are obviously different ways to measure this and there are different kinds of spending, but those are real cuts with real impact on the government and on Americans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I don\xe2\x80\x99t but I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- my understanding is that they are providing something back at home in Washington out of the press/comms office.\xc2\xa0 But if -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything additional on top of that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks for flying with us.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:50 P.M.
