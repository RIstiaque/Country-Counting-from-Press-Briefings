Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t*Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:01 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I trust you all had a good weekend, and then back to work today. \xc2\xa0I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Kuhnhenn, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0A couple subjects. \xc2\xa0I wanted to first start with trade and see what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is at this point, given that it seems highly unlikely that you can recapture the lost Democratic votes on the trade assistance side of things. \xc2\xa0Are you guys counting on Republicans flipping on that vote? \xc2\xa0Or is this likely to be something that goes on until the end of summer, as was one option that the House Majority Leader suggested?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, I can tell you that there have been a number of conversations over the weekend and already today about the legislative path forward. \xc2\xa0The President and the rest of us here at the White House continue to be confident that there is strong bipartisan support for this approach, and we just have to figure out how to untangle the legislative snafu in the House. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that members of the House have been presented with trying to navigate problems like this, but the White House will certainly be engaged in trying to help Democrats and Republicans on the Hill figure this out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But do you see this as a -- is there going to be a short-term solution, or do you see this as extending perhaps until the end of summer, early spring? \xc2\xa0And what does that do to the prospects for negotiating a trade deal with the Pacific Rim countries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, Jim, I saw that Leader McCarthy did a news conference earlier today where he indicated something that we agree with, which is that the longer that this process plays out, the harder it is to build bipartisan support for.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is we believe we have some momentum. \xc2\xa0Just in the last several weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen both TPA and TAA pass with bipartisan support in the Senate. \xc2\xa0We saw the Senate do something that many people thought was not possible, which is actually build a legitimate bipartisan majority for TPA in the House. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good news. \xc2\xa0And we want to try to build on that momentum to complete what the President believes is necessary to negotiating an agreement that clearly is in the best interest of the economy and in the best interest of American middle-class workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House think the two issues have to be joined together in order to get success?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, all of these kinds of procedural questions are ones that members of the House will have to encounter. \xc2\xa0Obviously the Speaker of the House will have a lot to say about this. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the President has the opportunity to speak to Speaker Boehner today to discuss this issue. \xc2\xa0But ultimately he will have more to say about this than anybody because he\xe2\x80\x99s the one that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for determining the calendar on the floor. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99ll work that out, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Saturday, in his radio address, the President again called for Democrats to support TAA. \xc2\xa0Then later, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sided with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. \xc2\xa0Did the President find that unhelpful?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the President about it. \xc2\xa0I think what Secretary Clinton articulated over the weekend is a view that she is neither reflexively in favor of trade agreements nor reflexively against them. \xc2\xa0She indicated that her test would be to examine an agreement and determine whether or not it was in the best interest of our national security, and to determine whether or not it was in the best interest of American workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat criteria may sound a little familiar to you because it\xe2\x80\x99s quite similar to the criteria that the President himself has established. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly surprising to anybody here that Secretary Clinton might identify similar criteria, considering she served as the Secretary of State under President Obama. \xc2\xa0So the overlap, if you will, in their views is not surprising.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another subject -- I wanted to raise a question about an event, and actually raise some concerns about an event here in the White House this weekend. \xc2\xa0The White House did not verify a gathering here of about 500 people, including some musicians, even after this had gained quite widespread notice on social media. \xc2\xa0And I wondered why the White House did not at least verify the event.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to tell you about a non-public event that occurred at the White House. \xc2\xa0I think we have confirmed for you that the President and First Lady did hold a private party here at the White House over the weekend. \xc2\xa0But given the private nature of the event, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to discuss from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Even after it had been widely noted on social media, *and you invite [even by] people like Al Sharpton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, what\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, just once information about the event is in the public domain, I find it interesting that the White House would not at least acknowledge what was in the public domain.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s what I just did. \xc2\xa0The President and First Lady did host a private event here at the White House over the weekend. \xc2\xa0But given the fact that it was a private event, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time talking about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were there any House lawmakers at the private event on the weekend?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a guest list for you, Roberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Leader Pelosi suggested that she would be more amenable to trade if the fate of the highway bill was settled, or linked to it. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the White House open to linking those two things? \xc2\xa0And what kind of discussion or work is going on, on that path?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Roberta, you know that the President has certainly been a strong advocate for making strong investments in our infrastructure because of the impact it would have on the short-term prospects for job creation, as well as the long-term health of our economy. \xc2\xa0So the President has put forward a very specific plan for how he believes we can close some loopholes that will only benefit the wealthy and well-connected, and use revenue from those loophole closings to invest in our infrastructure that everybody benefits from. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated and, frankly, championed for a long time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the legislative procedure, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the Speaker of the House will have to determine in consultation with other members of the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a legislative procedure to advocate for from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What did the President do over the weekend to make his case to House Democrats, as particularly on TAA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Roberta, I think that you have heard the President and the rest of us make a pretty compelling case about how trade adjustment assistance is actually scheduled to lapse at the end of this fiscal year. \xc2\xa0So if the Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act by the end of September, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a program that has significant benefits for middle-class families all across the country expire. \xc2\xa0The President has long championed trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s made this a top priority, even outside the context of trade agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, last year, about 40 percent of the workers in this country who benefitted from trade adjustment assistance got assistance in the form of job training, principally, were workers that had not been affected by trade agreements. \xc2\xa0These are workers who could trace the loss of their job back to decisions that were made by companies to relocate operations into India and China. \xc2\xa0Those are the countries with whom we do not have free trade agreements. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of the case that the President made very forcefully to House Democrats when he visited the caucus meeting on Friday, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a case that you heard me make from this podium on Friday, as well, which is there\xe2\x80\x99s a broader question for policymakers here in Washington, D.C. about what can we do to make sure that we are preparing or helping American workers weather the challenging forces of globalization. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, it is impossible to insulate the U.S. economy and U.S. workers from those broader forces of globalization. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the question that the President has in his mind is, what are we going to do about it? \xc2\xa0In the mind of the President, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a two-pronged approach. \xc2\xa0The first is, let\xe2\x80\x99s advocate for a trade deal with countries that are going business in the most economically dynamic region of the world, in Southeast Asia, and make sure that those countries are raising labor standards, that they\xe2\x80\x99re raising environmental standards, that they\xe2\x80\x99re respecting intellectual property rights, that they\xe2\x80\x99re writing into that agreement protections for basic human rights, and giving U.S. businesses the opportunity to do business in their countries. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s part of that strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second part is making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re helping those workers that have been negatively affected by broader globalization trends. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen such strong support from Democrats for this kind of program in the past. \xc2\xa0And the President is deeply concerned about the prospect of this kind of program expiring. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to just continue that program; he believes that we should expand it. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what did he do over the weekend to make that case to Democrats in the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that there were senior White House officials who were in touch with some members of Congress both in the House and the Senate over the weekend. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific conversations to tell you about.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, getting back to trade, you said that the President and Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s views overlap on trade. \xc2\xa0You said you weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised about that. \xc2\xa0But she said over the weekend that if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t changes made to the TPP, \xe2\x80\x9cthere should be no deal.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0So is the President open to making changes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, as you know, the TPP has not been completed. \xc2\xa0This is an agreement that is still under negotiation. \xc2\xa0And the President is determined to make sure that whatever the final agreement is, that it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of our national security and clearly in the best interest of middle-class families in this country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard that the President has set, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard the President will expect. \xc2\xa0If an agreement like that cannot be reached, then there won\xe2\x80\x99t be an agreement. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And is he hoping to get Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s seal of approval on the TPP?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what the President is hoping to do is to garner a bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate for a trade agreement, if one can be reached.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And how big is this OPM hack now? \xc2\xa0We know that during the investigation of the original OPM hack, a separate intrusion was detected, and senior administration officials were confirming that late Friday. \xc2\xa0That occurred after the briefing when we were catching wind of this after the briefing. \xc2\xa0So how big is it now? \xc2\xa0Is it more than that 4.1 million people that was originally estimated?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, as you know, the precise scope of these intrusions continues to be under investigation by the FBI, by DHS, and other technology professionals. \xc2\xa0And the administration continues to be committed to making sure that we are communicating as much information as possible to those individuals who may have been affected by these particular intrusions.<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, Jim, that at the beginning of last week the administration began notifying some federal employees that their information may have been compromised, and if there is a need for us to communicate with more either current or former federal employees, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There were senior administration officials saying that in addition to current and former federal employees, that even prospective employees might have been affected in this separate intrusion. \xc2\xa0And so I suppose those are people who were just applying for a job, went through the process, and perhaps did not land a job with the federal government. \xc2\xa0I would imagine that even though you can\xe2\x80\x99t put a precise number on it, that the scope of this has expanded fairly dramatically.<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, I think that what the announcement over the weekend indicated is that there was a second intrusion that was under investigation. \xc2\xa0It involved a different system and a different set of data. \xc2\xa0And I think you could logically conclude that there is a likelihood that the amount of data and information was -- that a larger amount of data and information was potentially affected. \xc2\xa0But this is something that still continues to be under investigation by the FBI and DHS.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And getting back to the party on Saturday night, you said it was a private function. \xc2\xa0Does that mean that the President and the First Lady will be paying for that event with their own funds?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that includes the entertainment, the staff? \xc2\xa0Who was staffing the event? \xc2\xa0Was it White House staff? \xc2\xa0Was it catering staff that came in?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have all those details for you, Jim, other than to tell you that the President and First Lady paid for the event.<br/>\n\tVictoria.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jason Chaffetz, the Chair of the House Government Reform Committee, is saying that Office Personnel Management officials are being very reluctant to testify before his committee tomorrow on the hack. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, that they say that they won\xe2\x80\x99t testify. \xc2\xa0What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position on whether they should testify tomorrow?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Victoria, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we have one, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to OPM to confirm their participation or to explain why they don\xe2\x80\x99t, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think that OPM officials should testify about the hack?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Victoria, the thing I can tell you is that I know that there have been a number of senior administration officials who, over the last number of weeks, have repeatedly traveled to Capitol Hill to make sure that members of Congress have been briefed in some detail about this particular incident. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously more that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to disclose in those kinds of confidential and, in some cases, even classified settings than we can publicly, but there are many conversations with the relevant congressional oversight committees on this issue.<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A follow on the party that the President had. \xc2\xa0Can you just explain what criteria the White House bases classifying something as a private event on, that you don\xe2\x80\x99t disclose on the President\xe2\x80\x99s public schedule?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Carol, I think what I can just describe to you is that the President and First Lady hosted a private social event at the White House on Saturday night, and it was not something that -- it was a private event and something that they paid for.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, you guys disclose private events, presumably, that don\xe2\x80\x99t have coverage; for instance, when the President hosts a screening in the White House movie theater. \xc2\xa0This was 500 people -- lobbyists, corporate executives, an international celebrity -- and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0So how do you justify that? \xc2\xa0And how is that in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to transparency?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Carol, I think the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a private event and the fact that details of this are known is an indication that the President is committed to being transparent. \xc2\xa0At the same time, the President and First Lady are going to reserve the right to host private parties at the White House. \xc2\xa0And they did it on their own dime, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kinds of values that they have talked about.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a different topic, the raid in Libya that reportedly killed a top member of al Qaeda. \xc2\xa0Are you --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0 Mokhtar Belmokhtar. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, I decided not to try --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been relishing the opportunity to discuss this. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Practicing it in the mirror? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And what is your response to that? \xc2\xa0Are you confirming that? \xc2\xa0And how does that advance the President\xe2\x80\x99s fight against terrorism?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Carol, what I can tell you is that the Department of Defense has confirmed that Mokhtar Belmokhtar was, in fact, the target of a counterterrorism strike that was taken in Libya over the weekend. \xc2\xa0Mokhtar Belmokhtar has a long history of leading terrorist activities as a member of AQIM. \xc2\xa0He is an al Qaeda-associated terrorist and the operational leader of an organization called al-Mourabitoun in northwest Africa.<br/>\n\tI am not in a position, at this point, to confirm the results of the strike. \xc2\xa0But when we have more details on that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to share it with you.<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just on the party one more time -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m relatively new around here, so --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s okay.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It sounds like --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nobody else in here was invited either. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So -- there appears to be some angst about that.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it sounds like, to follow up on her question, it\xe2\x80\x99s private if you just say it\xe2\x80\x99s private. \xc2\xa0Based on whatever criteria an event can be, if you say it\xe2\x80\x99s private, it\xe2\x80\x99s private. \xc2\xa0Is that it?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Ron, the point is that the President and First Lady, and I think most people across the country, would acknowledge that this is an appropriate thing for the President and First Lady to do, which is to open their house to guests and to host a private party on a Saturday night. \xc2\xa0And the fact that they paid for it on their own dime I think is an indication that this is a private event that\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the regular responsibilities of the President of the United States or the First Lady, but rather is an interest in hosting a private party.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there really is no criteria? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just that they, for whatever reason, if they deem it private, it\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, Ron, I think the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a private event paid for the President and First Lady that occurred in their own home on a Saturday night, I think most people would recognize that, understandably, as a private event.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the trade thing, you described what happened there as a procedural thing, as a snafu. \xc2\xa0Yet this is something that the President invested a lot of personal, capital time. \xc2\xa0Why would he invest so much time and energy into something that essentially it was a procedural matter? \xc2\xa0Clearly this is much more than a procedural fight between him and the members of his own party. \xc2\xa0It seems that it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly a difference in ideology, a difference in belief about --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I strongly disagree with that, Ron. \xc2\xa0The fact is, the President and Democrats share a view that policymakers in Washington, D.C. should be focused on the best interest of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0Those are shared values. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why the President so strongly advocates for the passage of trade adjustment assistance -- because of the impact that that does have on the livelihood of middle-class workers and middle-class families. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe last time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall -- the last time that trade adjustment assistance was on the floor of the House of Representatives, it was supported by every single Democrat that cast a vote; 125 of those members are still in the House of Representatives today. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make the case that trade adjustment assistance is assistance that actually matters. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about just continuing this program; we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, as I mentioned earlier, significantly expanding it. \xc2\xa0There are 24 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, up to 30,000 individuals who would benefit from this expansion.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you can see a scenario -- and then the Labor Secretary over the weekend said something to the effect that there are numerous pathways to get where we want to go. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a way to turn 90 votes, essentially, in a couple of days? \xc2\xa0And what are those pathways? \xc2\xa0Can you --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in here previously before -- I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no legislative expert -- so in terms of the legislative mechanics involved, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to -- I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with your sources on Capitol Hill who may be able to explain those kinds of details better than I can.<br/>\n\tAll I can tell you is that we continue to be committed to the idea that this is critically important business for us to get done on behalf of the American people and on behalf of middle-class families in this country. \xc2\xa0We also continue to be confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to get it done. \xc2\xa0And the reason -- again, the reason that I would point out to you that this is a procedural issue that we have to manage is there\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives for trade adjustment assistance. \xc2\xa0A bipartisan majority of members of Congress recognize that this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to middle-class families and middle-class workers. \xc2\xa0And the reason it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t pass at the end of last week is because there are some procedural differences that have to be ironed out, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working through right now.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about the broad issue of whether the trade deal is good, bad or indifferent? \xc2\xa0And the other thing you --<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to judge that because the trade deal has not been completed yet. \xc2\xa0This is a document that continues to be under negotiation.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was going to say. \xc2\xa0Is there anything specific in the package as it exists now, or any specific provisions that the President is insisting on in that package that would give the Democrats in the House more reassurance that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get what they want and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be what they want; that the final deal is going to be what they want?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The final deal that the President hopes to present, if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to reach one, will be an agreement that he believes will clearly be in the best interest of our national security and clearly in the best interest of American workers and American businesses.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But nothing specific you can point to at this point?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because there\xe2\x80\x99s not a final agreement. \xc2\xa0Once there is a final agreement, there will be a variety of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to point to.<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And just lastly, there is some information that the FDA is planning to announce a ban on Trans fats. \xc2\xa0Is that going to happen soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the FDA for any questions about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0First one, the U.S., Canada, has been very much involved in the assurance measure operations in Eastern Europe -- Poland and Baltic States. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeated several times that the U.S. is not going to go to war for Ukraine. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know the evaluation of the situation at the border of the two countries. \xc2\xa0And along the Russian border, what\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation of the situation over there?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Richard, we continue to be concerned about the fact that we see the steady flow of materiel and personnel from the Russian side of the border into Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of evidence to indicate that the Russian military continues to provide critically important weapons and assistance to Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. \xc2\xa0There is ample evidence to indicate that Russian military personnel are actively involved in that effort. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the source of significant concern not just on the part of the United States, but by our partners in Europe and around the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it certainly -- that continued activity flies in the face of the kinds of commitments that Russia has previously made to deescalate the situation in Ukraine and respect the basic territorial integrity of their neighbor. \xc2\xa0And this is a situation that we continue to be concerned about. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the U.S., through NATO or its own, considering ways to help Ukraine in face of what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Richard, there has been substantial military assistance that the United States has already provided to Ukraine. \xc2\xa0We continue to stand with the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian military as they face this threat. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has also provided ample economic assistance -- and this is something that the President indicated was a priority back at the G7 meetings in Germany last week -- that it\'s important for the international community to come forward and support the government of Ukraine and the economy of Ukraine, even as they face this challenge in the eastern part of their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has mobilized substantial economic assistance to the people of Ukraine. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been gratified to see that other international organizations have also provided some economic support. \xc2\xa0But that support is going to be critically important to the success of the Ukrainian government as they try to deescalate the situation in the eastern part of their country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Different topic, Josh. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen several years ago one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s daughters play soccer in my neighborhood, actually. \xc2\xa0Is the President following the Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup in the Great White North? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it, but I do expect that the President is cheering on the U.S. women as they compete in that tournament. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the OPM hack, someone in this room asked you on Friday, I think, whether it had affected the private information of any Cabinet members. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask that question again today and add to it whether the President and Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s information was ever in any danger, or whether it was in fact swooped up by whoever carried out this breach.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Olivier, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any precise information about the scope of this particular intrusion or what data may have been affected. \xc2\xa0We know that it\'s highly likely that some sensitive data was affected. \xc2\xa0But the scope of that data and precisely which data was affected is something that continues to be investigated by the FBI and DHS. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on a very different topic. \xc2\xa0The administration has cited the 2001 AUMF as legal justification for operations in Iraq. \xc2\xa0And I\'m wondering whether you think -- whether the administration thinks that you have legal justification to strike Syrian government forces if they threaten the forces that Americans and others are training. \xc2\xa0So if you reinsert some of these trained groups back into the Syrian theater, are American military forces prepared and legally authorized to strike Assad\xe2\x80\x99s forces?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me take that question, Olivier, just to make sure that we get you the precise legal answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to ask a couple different questions on two different subjects. \xc2\xa0One, the President is in a very interesting situation during this presidential election. \xc2\xa0He has friends, as you have mentioned, that are running. \xc2\xa0And now he has friends who are either family members -- well, a son of a President, and a brother of a President, and a wife of a President. \xc2\xa0What kind of position does this put this President in when it comes to this 2016 election cycle?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It puts him in the role of interested observer. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he certainly is following the race and aware of the discussions and debate that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in the context of this election. \xc2\xa0But at this point, the President has not weighed in, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that he will anytime soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand. \xc2\xa0But he is a President who is a friend of Presidents from other parties. \xc2\xa0The Bushes -- daddy Bush and W. \xc2\xa0And then he\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of Bill Clinton -- former President of his own party. \xc2\xa0In a realistic way -- I mean, he understands this is going -- we understand that he will follow his party and vote the party line, but how does he handle these friendships in a time when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be war amongst these candidates -- friends?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, April, the people -- the former Presidents that you just listed are also quite interested observers in the presidential election, some more so than others I guess. \xc2\xa0But there is no doubt that President Obama would not expect that the robust debate that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, even in the early stages of this presidential election, would have any impact whatsoever on the close personal relationships that he feels with the former Presidents that you have named.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has spoken at length about his admiration and respect and affection for President H.W. Bush. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had the opportunity to see each other recently. \xc2\xa0The President did have an opportunity to visit with President George W. Bush and Mrs. Bush down at Selma. \xc2\xa0And the President really enjoyed the opportunity that he had to spend time with them there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously the President and First Lady have a close personal relationship with both President Clinton and Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0But at this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to weigh in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, and on the next subject. \xc2\xa0The Prince concert this weekend. \xc2\xa0Everyone is asking about why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it on the public schedule as relates to the White House, but I want to ask from another side. \xc2\xa0Did Prince specifically ask for it not to be announced?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I ask that for a serious reason, because of his religious beliefs -- Jehovah\xe2\x80\x99s Witnesses -- and the issue of politics. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And lastly, in 2005 -- I just watched a video, the Image Awards -- NAACP Image Awards; Prince received an award, and President Obama is in the front row dancing up a storm to Prince. \xc2\xa0How long have the Obamas been trying to bring Prince? \xc2\xa0And I heard they tried to get him to join the campaign -- to come in on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of the specific efforts to enlist the support of Prince in the presidential campaign. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Was it hard to say that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, it was not hard to say that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a first. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It probably is, probably is.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On trade, you said the President continues to be confident there is a strong bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0Does he continue to remain confident that it will pass? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0The President continues to be confident that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That it will pass?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- that we will navigate this particular procedural snafu and move this across the finish line.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So I want to come back to the question of exactly what he did over the weekend in light of this repudiation in the House -- or snafu, as you called it. \xc2\xa0He played golf, I believe, on Saturday, right? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did play golf on Saturday with some of his friends who were in town.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he play with any member of Congress or anybody with influence -- a member of Congress, or anybody who would be, you know --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did not play with any members of Congress. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree of influence that any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s golf partners may have with specific members of Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You saw Hillary Clinton offered some advice to the President, saying the President should listen to and work with his allies and colleagues, starting with Nancy Pelosi. \xc2\xa0Did the President listen to Nancy Pelosi or speak with Nancy Pelosi this weekend?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of any conversations between the two. \xc2\xa0I know that the President\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Staff, Denis McDonough, had an opportunity to speak with Leader Pelosi today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell us about that conversation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think I just did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, you told me half -- (laughter) -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details of the conversation to share.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it was obviously about the trade?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, it was focused on this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0How big a deal would it be to this President -- how big a blow would it be to this President and to the United States in terms of our relations with our Asian allies if this deal were to go down?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, Jon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s principal concern is actually not with his own political standing or, frankly, even our relationship with our allies in Asia. \xc2\xa0His principal concern is the impact that this would have on middle-class families in this country. \xc2\xa0And again, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, there is no possible way to insulate the American economy or American workers from the forces of globalization. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that, in many communities across the country, those forces of globalization have had a negative impact on the economy. \xc2\xa0And the question, I think, facing leaders in this country, particularly leaders in Washington D.C., is what are we going to do about it? \xc2\xa0And the President has articulated a very clear strategy about what he thinks we should do about it. \xc2\xa0The President believes that the United States needs to use our influence around the globe to engage and to seek to level the playing field so that American businesses and American workers can compete on a level playing field. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s confident that, if they\xe2\x80\x99re given that opportunity, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll win. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut for those workers that have been affected by these broader global force in a negative way, we know actually what works. \xc2\xa0We know that, through trade adjustment assistance, workers can get the training that they need to go and get a good job. \xc2\xa0And according to data from just this last fiscal year, about 77 percent of workers that have gotten trade adjustment assistance and gone through a job-training program have gotten a good-paying job within six months. \xc2\xa0And six months later, they still -- 90 percent of them are still in that job. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that we do know what we can do to offer assistance to workers that are struggling with globalization. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd a lot of these are workers who weren\xe2\x80\x99t negatively affected by trade deals that the United States had signed; these are workers who are affected by broader global forces, including the shifting of some jobs to places like China and India, where the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have free trade agreements. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s principal concern is that trade adjustment assistance is going to expire at the end of September. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so the question for Democrats and Republicans right now is, what are you going to do to prevent that program from expiring, knowing the positive impact that it has on middle-class families all across the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You suggested earlier that Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s statements on this are directly in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0Are we to understand -- because it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been clear, necessarily, from what she had said publicly -- but is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that Hillary Clinton is lockstep in support of his view on trade -- on these bills?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For a clear distillation of her views on this topic, particularly in the context of a presidential campaign, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to contact a spokesman for her presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because you did suggest, did you not, that the criteria she had outlined are the same as the President\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Based on what she had said publicly over the weekend, which is that she had two criteria for evaluating trade agreements, which is the impact it would have on national security and the impact it would have on middle-class workers across the country. \xc2\xa0And --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the President spoken to her about this since this issue has come up in Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had conversation about this issue in the last couple of days, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, one last question. \xc2\xa0You remember Larry Summers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh, of course, very well. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Very well. \xc2\xa0Enjoyed the opportunity to work with him here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A very important advisor to the President over the years, a member of his Cabinet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0A widely regarded economist.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He said the repudiation of this trade deal would neuter the U.S. presidency for the next 19 months. \xc2\xa0Is Larry Summers right, that if this goes down, it neuters the U.S. presidency for the next 19 months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s his assessment to try to reach. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing every single thing that we can for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask about the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus. \xc2\xa0Do you agree that it would neuter the presidency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I agree is that our priority here, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re spending most of our time focused on, is trying to help middle-class families. \xc2\xa0The President has said that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use his remaining time in office to try to advance the interests of middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And again, we face these broader global forces, and the question is what are we going to do about it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has got a clear strategy to allow the United States to use our influence in the world to try to level the playing field in a way that will be advantageous to American businesses and American workers. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s ample opportunity for those on the outside to draw their own political conclusions, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not focused on politics right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear a \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard is a clear enunciation of what our strategy is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s focused on looking out for the interests of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Congressman Bill Shuster, who is the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has got a plan that would spin off the U.S. air traffic control system into a non-profit corporation -- is out today. \xc2\xa0Where does the White House stand on an idea like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Margaret, I can tell you that we have not had an opportunity to review the details of Chairman Shuster\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that it is the goal of the administration to continue our air traffic control system\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding safety record, and to take steps to make the system more innovative and efficient. \xc2\xa0And the administration is committed to working with Congress on reauthorizing legislation that improves and strengthens the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But would you consider -- you haven\'t fully engaged on this yet. \xc2\xa0Is this something that you\xe2\x80\x99re open-minded about, or your instinct is no, not so much?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think when it comes to a question like this, I think the first thing to consider is the safety record. \xc2\xa0And obviously the current air traffic control system has an outstanding safety record. \xc2\xa0But as we consider this proposal as others that will involve the reauthorization of the FAA, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch with Congress about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go back to the Prince concert. \xc2\xa0This is about twice the size of your average state dinner. \xc2\xa0So I guess maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re surprised that there are this many questions about it in the press briefing room --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mildly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- or you\xe2\x80\x99re not surprised at all, and figure let the chips fall where they may on Monday. \xc2\xa0But is there like a size threshold at which a private event just clearly becomes something that has to be disclosed? \xc2\xa0And in light of the fact that there are now so many questions about it -- I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t come with a guest list, but there were a lot of corporate folks, administration folks -- influencers. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just like -- it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Bobby Titcomb, right? \xc2\xa0It was like people who make stuff happen in New York and Washington. \xc2\xa0Would you consider now disclosing a guest list? \xc2\xa0And what was the purpose? \xc2\xa0Was it like a birthday party, or just like, whatever, it\xe2\x80\x99s June, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a party?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was a private event and an opportunity for the President and First Lady to host some of their friends at the White House at a party they paid for on their own dime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all friends, was it? \xc2\xa0I mean, 500 people are -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not close friends with 500 people.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I described them as close friends, I just described them as friends. \xc2\xa0And yes, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the President and First Lady obviously have the opportunity to meet lots of people and make lots of friends, and many of them were invited to the White House on Saturday night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you consider releasing now a guest list because there\xe2\x80\x99s so much interest in it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask quickly one more since I\'m on a roll? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Could you give us an update on the hostage review that the White House is considering? \xc2\xa0Are you expecting -- should we expect anything this week, perhaps? \xc2\xa0June, I think people have had their eye on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific timeframe to lay out for you. \xc2\xa0This is obviously some work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done over the last several months. \xc2\xa0And I would just indicate to you that we\xe2\x80\x99re nearing completion of this particular document. \xc2\xa0 Some of this review will remain classified and we won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to talk about publicly. \xc2\xa0But I know that part of the work of a team that\xe2\x80\x99s been conducting this review has been to ensure that there is a document that we can discuss publicly to help the American public understand the great lengths that the federal government goes to, to try to rescue those Americans who are being held hostage overseas. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to talk -- more detail that we can talk about on this relatively soon. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0But maybe not this week? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific timeframe for you, but relatively soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Over the weekend, senior administration official Thomas Shannon had a long meeting with the President of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s National Assembly in Haiti. \xc2\xa0At the end of the meeting, the Venezuelan, Diosdado Cabello, said the meeting was aimed at normalizing diplomatic relations. \xc2\xa0Is the administration considering returning ambassadors between the two countries, or any similar steps to fuller ties?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of this particular meeting, Drew, but let me see if we can get back to you. \xc2\xa0If not, I might recommend that you pose your question to the State Department. \xc2\xa0 They may have some more details on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMajor.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple new topics, Josh. \xc2\xa0The stocks are down this morning, partly in relationship to the volatility and fear associated with the inability to work out an arrangement from international bankers and creditors with the Greek government. \xc2\xa0When we were in Austria, you spoke a week ago in hopeful terms that conversations would lead to a productive outcome and both sides would give a little, and volatility would be avoided. \xc2\xa0Neither have taken place. \xc2\xa0Where do things stand now? \xc2\xa0And what has the administration done over the weekend, if anything, to try to bring this to a resolution?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, we do continue to be hopeful that all sides will be able to come to an agreement without adding undue volatility to the financial markets.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So now it\xe2\x80\x99s undue volatility?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess this is an acknowledgement of what you said, that there has been some volatility in reaction to sort of the tea leaf reading of the ongoing negotiations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about what our position is, which is that the Greek people have endured prolonged hardship and have taken difficult but important steps to lay the groundwork for sustainable economic recovery. \xc2\xa0The Greek government and its international partners need to work expeditiously to finalize a credible reform program that can lay the foundation for long-term growth within the eurozone. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the reason that we have continued to be optimistic of a favorable outcome here -- and by favorable, I mean an outcome that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add undue volatility to the financial markets -- is that all of the partners who sit around the table conducting these negotiations recognize the stakes of resolving these negotiations in a satisfactory way. \xc2\xa0And so it may be difficult to get to the final result, but it is clearly in the interest of all of those who are around the table negotiating to reach the same result. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You just mentioned the tough choices the Greeks have made and endured. \xc2\xa0That was not the emphasis the President placed on this subject matter last week. \xc2\xa0He said clearly the Greeks have to make more tough political choices, placing the onus principally on the Greek government. \xc2\xa0Is that still the position of this administration?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s our position that, frankly, both sides need to engage in these conversations in a way that leads to a compromise agreement. \xc2\xa0And we have indicated that it is important for the Greek government to follow through on the critical structural reforms that they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to implementing. \xc2\xa0And I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what their financial creditors are interested in seeing. \xc2\xa0And I think any sort of final agreement will require a commitment along those lines. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that all sides will have to work out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Lew has been chiefly responsible for engaging with the Greeks and other members of the Eurozone and other international organizations to try to encourage a resolution. \xc2\xa0So for updates in terms of conversations the United States has had, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There was an announcement over the weekend about U.S. expanding its military engagement into the Baltics. \xc2\xa0Could you describe how that came about? \xc2\xa0Was that discussed by the President privately at the G7? \xc2\xa0Did he let other nations know that this was coming? \xc2\xa0And what message does this send to Moscow?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Major, I\'m not aware of any specific conversations that the President had with our G7 partners on this specific topic. \xc2\xa0I will say that even the early stories indicated that this proposal is still working its way through the policy process and is in the early stages of the policy process. \xc2\xa0But it is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be reversed, do you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it is consistent with what we have previously indicated about the United States commitment to fulfilling our Article 5 responsibilities and ensuring that all of our allies are committed to that agreement. \xc2\xa0And we want to make sure that NATO allies are defending their territory on a 24/7 basis, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to support them and exercise vigilance in that regard. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is something that was discussed extensively at the Wales NATO summit that the President participated in last year. \xc2\xa0And there was agreement among the allies of the need to enhance the readiness of the NATO Response Force. \xc2\xa0And so the discussions that -- the policy discussions that were reported over the weekend are consistent with furthering that goal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a sense of urgency about this, that -- and is there anything that the U.S. has picked up or its allies there have picked up that create a sense that this needs to happen sooner rather than later to have the appropriate deterrent effect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Major, I think our goal here is to further intensify our coordination with our NATO allies and to make sure that we\'re all -- all of our allies are living up to the commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made as it relates to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty. \xc2\xa0And this is -- again, this is consistent with that responsibility. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s aimed at ensuring that the territory of our NATO allies is properly defended.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jon came very close to getting at this, so I just want to bore in a little bit. \xc2\xa0Did the President himself make a single phone call this weekend to any member of Congress advocating a new legislative strategy to resolve the snafu over TAA?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have a lot of specific -- I can tell you that a number of phone calls were placed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0By the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0But the phone calls I can tell you about are the President does intend to try to communicate on the telephone with the Speaker of the House today. \xc2\xa0I know that the President has placed a call and they still haven\xe2\x80\x99t connected yet, but they will today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right, that\'s one. \xc2\xa0All right, that\'s one.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The Chief of Staff today did connect with Leader Pelosi, where they discussed this issue. \xc2\xa0I know that the Chief of Staff also had an opportunity to speak with Leader McConnell to give him an update of our view of the situation. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have a lot of details from those conversations to share at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out how many times he picked up the phone. \xc2\xa0So it was once?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So again, I don\'t have any other details to share in terms of what occurred this weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0The burden falls -- for resolving this snafu -- falls on the President, the Speaker, or the Minority Leader?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a legislative snafu.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But who does the burden fall on? \xc2\xa0Who needs to find the votes? \xc2\xa0Because you indicated to Ron a moment ago, call your sources. \xc2\xa0We all have. \xc2\xa0And the same answer comes. \xc2\xa0Somebody needs to find some votes because they don\'t exist. \xc2\xa0So who does the burden fall upon to find the votes that currently don\'t exist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s not actually a legislative procedure that\'s laid out at this point. \xc2\xa0So once we\'re --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, but one thing that will direct the procedure is finding votes -- because once you have people to vote for something, then you have a procedure you can lay before them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Major, that you have highlighted what some people find quite frustrating about the legislative process, which is that sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s a discussion about, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s build the votes and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll decide what the procedure is going to be for what we actually vote on. \xc2\xa0And in some cases, people say, well, let\xe2\x80\x99s figure out what the votes are going to be -- what the procedure is going to be, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go about the process of whipping support for the vote schedule that we\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is that the path forward is something that continues to be the subject of intensive discussion not just among reporters and their sources, but also among members of the Democratic and Republican staffs on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And some of those conversations are taking place with the input of White House staff, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately determining that path forward is something that the Speaker of the House is going to have to determine. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s the one that sets the floor schedule, and so he\xe2\x80\x99s the one that\'s responsible for that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the Majority Leader.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll do that in conjunction with certainly conversations they have here at the White House and in conversations they have with the minority, as well -- because the other thing we know is that this is going to require bipartisan support. \xc2\xa0And at each stage in this process, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Democrats and Republicans come together to advance this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was true when Republicans put on the floor the rule opening up this vote; and that required, in rather unusual fashion, eight Democrats to side with Republicans to advance the rule. \xc2\xa0This was true when TPA was considered. \xc2\xa0It required Democrats and Republicans to come together to pass it. \xc2\xa0It got 28 Democrats, which I think was to the mild surprise of some.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we are going to need a similar bipartisan majority to emerge around this issue of trade adjustment assistance to make sure that we\'re looking out for the interests of American workers. \xc2\xa0So the point, is Democrats and Republicans are going to have to work together on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mokhtar Belmokhtar, you said he was targeted. \xc2\xa0Do you know, and can you confirm, if he was killed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I cannot confirm that. \xc2\xa0It is typical for the Department of Defense, when strikes like this are carried out, to conduct a battle damage assessment. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that they are -- my understanding is they\'re still doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And historically you have been reluctant to confirm a targeting until DNA evidence has been obtained. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been reported that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been obtained, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear what the actual result of this targeting was.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are experts who will take a close look at this, and it may take some time for them to fully evaluate the results of this strike. \xc2\xa0But when they have reached a conclusion about the results, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let them make that announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks, I want to take you to Cuba, and I want to get your perspective on the release of the six detainees to Oman. \xc2\xa0A lot of people, Americans, who are unfamiliar with the mindset of the administration would say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, why would they do that? \xc2\xa0These guys were being held; they must have done something.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Can you unpack the thought behind releasing these six detainees to Oman?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I can confirm for you that there were six individuals who had been held at the prison at Guantanamo Bay that have been transferred to the custody of the Omanis. \xc2\xa0Prior to any transfer like this taking place, the Secretary of Defense must certify that there are restrictions in place that limit the threat to the national security of the United States. \xc2\xa0That\'s something that the Secretary of Defense has to certify. \xc2\xa0We typically do not in public discuss precisely the security measures that are in place. \xc2\xa0But the transfer would not have occurred if the Secretary of Defense were not satisfied that the threat that these individuals pose to American national security was not sufficiently mitigated. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a couple more. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you about Bowe Bergdahl. \xc2\xa0When the administration agreed to the transfer of the so-called Taliban Five, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you factored into that the decision the intelligence that Bergdahl had, A, walked away; and B, according to senior military officials, had actually gotten high with Afghan officers and soldiers. \xc2\xa0Was that a part of your decision tree in allowing this procedure to go forward to try to get those guys sent away?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kevin, I can tell you that what factored into the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision is the commitment that the Commander-in-Chief has made to every single American who put on the uniform that we\'re not going to leave them behind. \xc2\xa0And that is what -- that was the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority in terms of securing the successful release of Sergeant Bergdahl. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that there is an ongoing military justice inquiry into the circumstances of his disappearance. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t want to say anything about that ongoing investigation that may in any way interfere with the efforts of those investigators to learn more about his disappearance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just so I\xe2\x80\x99m clear, it doesn\'t matter what he\xe2\x80\x99s done or she\xe2\x80\x99s done; if they go away, we\'re going to go get them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Kevin, that I would say two things about that. \xc2\xa0The first is, it does matter. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we have the military justice system. \xc2\xa0But what we also have is we also have a commitment from this Commander-in-Chief and every previous Commander-in-Chief that when an American puts on the military uniform of the United States of America, we\'re not going to leave them behind.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to get a macro question to wrap up for me. \xc2\xa0Given the trade battle, given Obamacare -- the battle there in the High Court, there are so many other little issues that we would call legacy items that seem to be in the balance. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious from your perspective, to use a boxing analogy, does the President feel like he\xe2\x80\x99s still fighting for all these legacy items? \xc2\xa0Is he on the ropes? \xc2\xa0Is he sort of taking a beating from your perspective? \xc2\xa0Because it seems like every time he puts a legacy item out there, there seems to be something that seems to either chop away at it little by little, or in the case of the trade circumstance, get rejected outright.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, there were previous reports a month ago that the President\xe2\x80\x99s trade agenda had been rejected in the Senate, but it eventually passed. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue that dogged effort to stand up for middle-class families in the House.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think the fact is we have seen, principally from Republicans, an effort -- a dogged effort to try to stymie the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And whether that is the Affordable Care Act that has allowed 16 million Americans to get health care and kept the health care inflation at the lowest levels in 50 years, or even protections that strongly benefit middle-class families across the country that prevent women from being charged more just because they\'re women; or prevent those individuals with preexisting conditions from being discriminated against for having that preexisting condition. \xc2\xa0The Affordable Care Act is something the President feels strongly about, and we\'re going to continue to do everything that we can to try to implement that in a way that maximizes the benefits for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of resistance from Republicans. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve even seen Republicans resort to trying to use the court system to try to stymie the President\xe2\x80\x99s progress. \xc2\xa0And if you take a look at this President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative record and set of accomplishments, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to look back after eight years and indicate that -- and see a lot of evidence to indicate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made some really important progress on behalf of middle-class families over his time in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. \xc2\xa0I forgot to ask about the story out of Spokane, Washington. \xc2\xa0There was an American woman who -- it has been alleged -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be careful in how I frame this. \xc2\xa0She suggested she was African American. \xc2\xa0It turns out she wasn\'t African American. \xc2\xa0She was an NAACP leader in that city and has since resigned. \xc2\xa0Was the President made aware of that story? \xc2\xa0Has he followed that story? \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any comment on that story?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The White House does not have any comment, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the President has said he wants to close the Guantanamo Bay detainee facility, and that it\xe2\x80\x99s been a recruiting tool for terrorists. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s been thwarted by Congress. \xc2\xa0Is there a goal or a plan to send as many detainees as possible to other countries so that it, in effect, is closed before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Pam, as you know, the administration has undergone a great effort to try to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, principally because it does serve as a recruiting tool for al Qaeda and other terrorists. \xc2\xa0It also is prohibitively expensive, and the President does not believe it is in the best interest of American national security to continue to operate that prison. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so what he has sought to do is to work closely with our partners around the world to try to transfer those detainees out of the prison. \xc2\xa0There are in place significant security measures to mitigate the threat that those individuals may pose to American national security when those transfers occur.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President does believe that we would be more successful in this effort if Congress were willing to engage constructively in it. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Congress repeatedly throw up legislative obstacles to prevent the closure of the prison. \xc2\xa0And they do that -- Congress has done that despite the bipartisan support for closing the prison.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President and his team continue to be focused on trying to accomplish that goal. \xc2\xa0But it\'s a goal that\xe2\x80\x99s been made more difficult because of congressional interference. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, we believe we\xe2\x80\x99d be more effective if Congress were actually willing to work with the administration to accomplish that goal. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think he could pare it down to almost no detainees by the time he leaves office?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of prediction to make at this point. \xc2\xa0But I can assure you that the President and his team are working hard in pursuit of a goal that the President identified in his first couple of days here in office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Both you and the President have said that there were other things in terms of Russia and Ukraine that the U.S. could do other than the economic sanctions that are already in place. \xc2\xa0Would moving heavy military equipment into some of the Eastern European countries be one of those things?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, the fact is, Ukraine is not a NATO ally. \xc2\xa0And obviously the status of countries in that region of the world varies, and the relationship between the United States and those countries is different based on that status. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States has an obligation to ensure that we are protecting the territorial integrity of our NATO allies. \xc2\xa0We signed a NATO treaty that provides for the defense of our allies, and that is a treaty that the United States and this President is serious about upholding. \xc2\xa0We continue to encourage our allies to be similarly serious about upholding that commitment and to making the kinds of financial commitments that are necessary to back it up. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe situation with Ukraine is a little bit different; it is not a NATO ally. \xc2\xa0But the United States and many of our NATO partners do feel strongly about the international principle that\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, which is protecting the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of an independent nation. \xc2\xa0And we have seen Russia grossly violate that sovereignty. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the international community step forward. \xc2\xa0The United States has provided military assistance to the Ukrainians. \xc2\xa0The United States has provided substantial economic assistance to the Ukrainians to try to bolster the government and bolster their economy while they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with this challenging situation in the eastern part of the country. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked closely with the international community in that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as it relates to the specific announcement over the weekend in terms of moving equipment into Eastern Europe, I would just note that, as I mentioned to Major, that that\xe2\x80\x99s still in the early stages of the policymaking process but is consistent with the strategy that we have previously pursued.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could it be seen as a message to Vladimir Putin if it was done?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it is a message to the world -- most directly to our NATO allies -- that the United States is serious about living up to our Article 5 commitments in the context of the NATO Treaty. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tChris. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, among the -- Supreme Court this month is its decision on same-sex marriage. \xc2\xa0The ruling will determine whether states have a right under the 14th Amendment to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying. \xc2\xa0But there is federal implications as well, because certain Social Security and veterans benefits aren\xe2\x80\x99t flowing to married same-sex couples in states without marriage equality. \xc2\xa0Is the administration looking at contingency plans in the event -- potentially these benefits flow same-sex couples -- in the event the Supreme Court upholds bans on same-sex marriage? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chris, at this point, we continue to have a lot of confidence in the legal arguments that were made by the Solicitor General with regard to this matter. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not aware of any contingency planning that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSusan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0On the Gitmo issue, the President decided to release those detainees on Friday night. \xc2\xa0I was wondering about, first, the timing. \xc2\xa0And then, McCain told me last week that Lisa Monaco and others in the Pentagon were working on a plan to put forward, to send up to Congress to shut down Gitmo that maybe Congress would find palatable. \xc2\xa0McCain is willing to work with you. \xc2\xa0Do you feel like -- Manchin also told me that -- Senator Manchin -- told me that he thought it was disappointing that these detainees were going to be released in the middle of this movement for a plan in Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDo you think that timing of those released on a Friday night -- can you tell me about why that was done? \xc2\xa0And can you tell me what your response is to Manchin, who says this is disappointing and can poison the well for a deal in Congress to shut down Gitmo?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things about this. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about the particular timing. \xc2\xa0Obviously these kinds of transfers are closely coordinated with our partners around the world; in this case with Oman. \xc2\xa0I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s -- would note that one of the legislative hurdles has been built into our efforts to transfer detainees from the prison at Guantanamo Bay is notification of Congress 30 days prior to this transfer. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, anyway, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details beyond that. \xc2\xa0You might check with the Department of Defense to see if they have more details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about the plan that Lisa Monaco is working on with the Pentagon to send up to the -- any timing on that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific details of conversations that have taken place. \xc2\xa0Obviously we have identified that is an important priority, and this is a priority that the President has identified in his second or third day in office. \xc2\xa0And we would have made more progress in this regard had Congress not been working so rigidly to try to prevent our efforts to -- or to thwart our efforts to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is ongoing. \xc2\xa0The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in our national security interests. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make progress. \xc2\xa0And when we have the updates on timing, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re confirming that there is an effort to send Congress a plan to close it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not confirming any of our conversations with members of Congress. \xc2\xa0I\'m just reiterating that it continues to be a priority that the President has identified, that his team is working hard on, to successfully close the prison at Guantanamo Bay because it\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent with our national security interests to keep it open.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On trade, Pelosi mentioned that there was some, maybe even a horse-trading deal that could be reached. \xc2\xa0And she specifically mentioned a long-term highway funding bill. \xc2\xa0And I\'m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that you all can get behind, and whether there\xe2\x80\x99s a movement afloat to try to convince Democrats to support the trade bill because maybe the Republicans will support a highway funding bill, maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the talks with Boehner today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think this goes to Major\xe2\x80\x99s question about sort of trying to design a procedural path forward here. \xc2\xa0And that, I\'m confident, will be the subject of extensive conversation on Capitol Hill between Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s view on investing in our infrastructure is something that\xe2\x80\x99s well known; we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward our specific plan. \xc2\xa0But we believe that there is ample reason for Democrats and Republicans to come together, particularly Democrats who have unanimously supported trade adjustment assistance in the past to support the extension and expansion of trade adjustment assistance that currently is being considered by Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But does the President support this idea of -- maybe a twofer here -- you could get the highway bill if Republicans can --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that Democrats and Republicans will have to discuss on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Prince issue just really quickly. \xc2\xa0Sorry, last question. \xc2\xa0Thank you for indulging me. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you tell me if there were any House Democrats invited to this event?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details on the guest list.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And can you tell me how much they paid for it?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, other than that the President and First Lady paid for it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
