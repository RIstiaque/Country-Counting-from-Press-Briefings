EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 We have no opening statements, but I have with me again today Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, and Dan Restrepo, who is the Senior Director at the National Security Council for the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re all here to take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you want to start?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in any kind of readout you can give us of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting today on Libya?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Ben take that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President this morning had a call with his senior national security team on Libya.\xc2\xa0 That included Secretary Gates, Secretary Clinton -- or actually, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I think Secretary Gates was meeting with the Prime Minister of Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So it was Secretary Clinton, Admiral Mullen, General Ham, Tom Donilon, Bill Daley, and Denis McDonough and Tony Blinken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President started by getting an update from General Ham on military operations in Libya, including the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made around Benghazi and also the efforts to protect the people of Libya in Misurata, as well as, again, the enforcement of a no-fly zone, which is increasingly being done by allied and partner planes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They also reviewed the ongoing discussions at NATO about the transition that will take place regarding command and control efforts and the enforcement of a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 And they reviewed diplomatic progress on a range of other issues associated with our efforts in Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the update on progress?\xc2\xa0 Is there any more clarity as of this meeting in terms of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s ability to take on his own people or the timeline of transition to other forces for the U.S.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to point out that, in the first instance, this intervention was taking place to prevent an imminent humanitarian catastrophe, a potential massacre of thousands if not tens of thousands of people in major population centers like Benghazi, Misurata, and other places where Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces were advancing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to underscore that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces have pulled back from Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And right now we\xe2\x80\x99re similarly focused on trying to protect the people of Misurata as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the first instance there\xe2\x80\x99s this immediate humanitarian objective I think that is the focus, frankly, of this phase one, along with the shaping of the conditions for a no-fly zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the timeline on transition, I think that is still being discussed at NATO.\xc2\xa0 Those discussions will continue.\xc2\xa0 I think as I said yesterday, there is an agreement that NATO is going to play a very important role in the command and control.\xc2\xa0 Again, the exact structure and relative participation of different countries is what they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to discuss, and they will do so, again, tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think this is going to be a matter of days in which you see a movement towards a transition with regard to command and control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, you already see an increase in the extent to which the no-fly zone, the enforcement of the no-fly zone piece of the effort in Libya right now is being undertaken by allies and partners.\xc2\xa0 You see, again, a number of allies stepping up with different contributions as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at the same time that we\xe2\x80\x99re working through the command and control issue, we\xe2\x80\x99re working to get contributions, clarity on contributions from a broader and growing range of coalition partners.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, on the subject of coalition participation, Germans are stepping back from their involvement in the coalition.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Stepping back from --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe the Germans are stepping back, reducing their involvement in the coalition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled their ships.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Germany -- I mean, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that Germany has had reservations about participating in military enforcement.\xc2\xa0 They abstained from the resolution, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- so, again, I think their hesitancy to be a robust participant in this has always been something that we were aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think if you look at a broad range of countries, to include of course the United Kingdom and France, but also Italy, Spain, the Dutch, several other European partners, the Turks are talking about what their contribution might be, as well as Qatar.\xc2\xa0 And then we continue to talk to other Arab states like Jordan and the UAE.\xc2\xa0 Different countries are going to have different contributions to make here.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that you see an expanding -- most of those countries that are coming forward with contributions, and at the same time that we are getting those efforts onboard, we are working through the final issues related to command and control, which, again, is an important thing to get right on the front end so that you have the best structure in place.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, what you want, as I think I said yesterday, is a situation in which you have the full capacity to make use of the -- NATO\xe2\x80\x99s unique ability to bring command and control assets to bear to a situation like this while also recognizing that you have a coalition that extends broader than NATO itself as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, those are the discussions that are taking place in Brussels; they\xe2\x80\x99re ongoing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress each day.\xc2\xa0 And we expect to have this transition in place in a matter of days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, in the congressional briefings, Congress was reportedly told that this is not a war.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on that?\xc2\xa0 And if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a war, what\xe2\x80\x99s the right way to characterize this operation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in those particular briefings.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said is that this is a military operation that will be limited in both duration and scope.\xc2\xa0 Our contribution to this military operation that is enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution is going to be limited -- time limited to the front end, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll shift to a support role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is we\xe2\x80\x99re enforcing a U.N. Security Council resolution.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re taking -- we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking a military operation to protect the people of Libya.\xc2\xa0 But that military operation is going to be, again, limited in both time and scope, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the position we took to Congress, although I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the precise briefings, so I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to war, then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what we are doing is enforcing a resolution that has a very clear set of goals, which is protecting the Libyan people, averting a humanitarian crisis, and setting up a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that involves kinetic military action, particularly on the front end.\xc2\xa0 But again, the nature of our commitment is that we are not getting into an open-ended war, a land invasion in Libya.\xc2\xa0 What we are doing is offering a unique set of capabilities over a period of days that can shape the environment for a no-fly zone.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What have you been doing during the flight, the President been doing during the flight, and what sort of communications have there been?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s spoken a number of times to Tom Donilon to get updated on the situation.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made additional calls.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans today, once he gets back, to call any world leaders?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 None that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I expect that there will be a number of calls to foreign leaders over the next coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, how do you respond to the critics who have said that the administration viewed it as essential to get international coalition support for this operation, including Arab League support, but has not viewed it as similarly essential to get congressional support for this operation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99d say two points about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we would like congressional support.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve consulted with Congress throughout this process, again, consulted before we took military action, and continue to brief Congress and, again, welcome congressional support and believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to have a very close and ongoing dialogue with Congress about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the importance of multilateral support, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental to America\xe2\x80\x99s interest that the President of the United States would ensure that we are not undertaking this action alone.\xc2\xa0 Were we to do so, the costs would be far greater for the American military, the American taxpayer.\xc2\xa0 Again, the questions around timeline and the enduring nature of our responsibility to enforce a no-fly zone would be far more ambiguous.\xc2\xa0 So, again, by taking the time to get international support for this effort, not only did we increase the legitimacy of the effort, and not only did we expand the number of partners both in the region and around the world who are supportive of this effort, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced the cost significantly to the United States in this undertaking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And frankly, it also is a uniquely international challenge when you have -- and regional challenge -- when you have somebody undertaking these kinds of atrocities.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important that it not just be the United States\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to deal with that but that you have regional powers and international partners participating as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your latest information on Muammar Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s status -- his physical status, his political status?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent days is Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s own forces that had been advancing at a very rapid pace across Libya are no longer making those advances; that you had masses of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces advancing imminently on Benghazi, for instance, which is what caused us to take the urgent action that we did.\xc2\xa0 And they are no longer doing that, and they are pulling back from Benghazi.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So -- and you have similar instances around the different parts of the country where, again, his forces are facing a challenge that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t before, and it\xe2\x80\x99s affecting their ability to harm the Libyan people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, as to his own political standing, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll watch closely.\xc2\xa0 We certainly saw the comments that came out from him yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that he is no longer advancing in a way that poses the same threat to the Libyan people as it did a week ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought he was still being pretty aggressive in Misurata, his forces there.\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in that situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99re actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is, again, is focused on Misurata and is having an effect there.\xc2\xa0 So that is certainly an area that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been concerned about, continue to be concerned about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President spoke at some length about the situation in Libya on Friday, he singled out a number of population centers, and the first two were Benghazi and Misurata.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, those are -- that is something we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the course of the last day or two Misurata be a focus of the coalition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the intelligence tell you about who it is that the allied forces are fighting exactly?\xc2\xa0 Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces?\xc2\xa0 How many are actually Libyans?\xc2\xa0 How many are mercenaries?\xc2\xa0 Where are the mercenaries from?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, say that one more time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who are the people we\xe2\x80\x99re fighting?\xc2\xa0 How many of them are Libyans?\xc2\xa0 How many are mercenaries?\xc2\xa0 Where are the mercenaries coming from?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have certainly been -- there are certainly forces that are Libyan that are loyal to Qaddafi who have been -- played an important role in these advances.\xc2\xa0 There are a set of military units that are particularly close to Qaddafi, again, that have been playing an important role, even as you had some military, particularly in the east, essentially defect from under Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s rule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also been clearly the use of mercenaries as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, for instance, why the U.N. Security Council resolution also authorizes actions to try to prevent -- try to work with the neighboring governments to try to prevent the flow of mercenaries into Libya so that he cannot draw upon that as a source going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you look at, again, some of the additional efforts -- I know there\xe2\x80\x99s so much focus on the efforts in the air -- but the enforcement of the arms embargo, which NATO agreed to carry out going forward, and the enforcement, again, of the -- stopping the flow of mercenaries is a further part of the tools that we have to bring to bear in terms of diminishing Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s own resources and his ability to brutalize his own people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any thought being given to a presidential address to explain to the American people a little -- in more clarity what this mission is and those issues about how long it will last, et cetera?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say two things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to communicate clearly and consistently with the American people about something as important as the type of military action that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in Libya.\xc2\xa0 I would argue that we have communicated on a very regular basis over the last several days.\xc2\xa0 You had the President make a statement on Libya on Friday at the White House in which he laid out precisely the case for why he felt this was important, why he felt it was in our interest, what we were doing, who the coalition we were doing it with was, and what the type of timeline would be for our engagement.\xc2\xa0 He had that statement on Saturday where he spoke to the initial authorization of the use of force.\xc2\xa0 And of course, over the course of the last two or three days at press conferences, he\xe2\x80\x99s had the ability to speak to Libya, as well as in interviews.\xc2\xa0 And in a letter up to Congress, he again detailed his case for the intervention.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That said, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to be looking for additional opportunities for him to continue to speak to the American people about the situation in Libya, again, keeping in mind that part of that is speaking to a dynamic and fluid situation in which we will have a responsibility to both explain, again, very clearly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, but also updating people on the evolution of our engagement and the evolution of our involvement and what is transpiring in Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, without specifically speaking to one speaking appearance, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly going to be the case that the President will continue to address the situation in Libya in the coming days.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have any details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule tomorrow and Friday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As of now there are no public events tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He has meetings in the White House, a full day of meetings.\xc2\xa0 And then on Friday, also no public events, with the exception of the Greek Independence Day reception Friday evening.\xc2\xa0 That obviously could change, but as of now that\xe2\x80\x99s the schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to add one other thing on one of the questions that Ben answered, and that is we obviously take very seriously, as Tom Donilon, Ben and others have said, the need for congressional consultations.\xc2\xa0 And we have done them and will continue to do them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would also say that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that in the run-up to this action, we were criticized somewhat -- in fact, fairly frequently -- by those who felt like we weren\xe2\x80\x99t moving quickly enough, and now some are criticizing us for not going -- for going too quickly, and what the President did was make an action based on -- make a decision based on an imminent threat of a humanitarian nature to a great number of Libyans, and he has done that with a great number of consultations with Congress that will continue.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember where we were a week ago and where we are now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you or Ben on the schedule just tell us precisely why the President is leaving early or left early from El Salvador, and whether concerns about him being seen sightseeing at the time of this military action played into that decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, insofar as we left early, it was by an hour.\xc2\xa0 I think all it was was we felt that there was a good opportunity for him to see the cathedral and the tomb of Oscar Romero yesterday, and this morning he was able to have a call that he\xe2\x80\x99s had every single day on this trip, basically the same secure conference call with the same people, while his family, again, was able to engage in a cultural stop.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, it really was just a matter of scheduling, nothing beyond that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Question for Dan?\xc2\xa0 Just very quickly, do you think that this trip achieved its objectives, particularly with the distractions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RESTREPO:\xc2\xa0 It certainly did.\xc2\xa0 One of the primary objectives of this trip was to underscore the importance of the Americas for the United States and for President Obama.\xc2\xa0 I think we saw that throughout.\xc2\xa0 It was also about setting a course on a relationship of working in partnership with countries throughout the Americas as we have an increasing number of capable partners in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we made significant progress on moving the economic and commercial relationship with Brazil forward that will benefit the United States in the medium to long term; in Chile as well made important progress on cooperation on disaster response, on trade, both in terms of enforcement of the existing trade agreement between the United States and Chile and particularly intellectual property rights enforcement improvements by the Chileans, as well as moving forward on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then in El Salvador, underscoring the importance of setting in motion and working with the Salvadorans to set in motion sustainable economic development that also has medium- to long-term benefits for the United States, as the President discussed yesterday with regard to immigration.\xc2\xa0 And on citizen security, evolving our relationship in the region on citizen security as we\xe2\x80\x99ve brought more partners to the table, more capable partners in the region -- Colombia, Chile, Canada, Mexico -- to work together with the United States and the countries of Central America to address something that very much has a bearing on the well-being of the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, all in all, I think the trip was very successful in underscoring the importance of the Americas to this President and to the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 4:25 P.M.
