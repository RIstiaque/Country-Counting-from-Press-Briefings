PST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Good morning, everyone. \xc2\xa0Welcome aboard Air Force One. \xc2\xa0As you probably have seen, today President Obama designated three new national monuments in the California desert, protecting nearly 1.8 million acres of America\xe2\x80\x99s public lands. \xc2\xa0Building on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to protect our land and water for future generations, today\xe2\x80\x99s designations will nearly double the number of acres of public lands previously protected as national monuments by President Obama.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith these new designations, the administration will have protected 265 million acres of public lands and waters. \xc2\xa0In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s more than any administration in history. \xc2\xa0And just wanted to let you know that we are minutes away from flying over some of these designated lands. \xc2\xa0We actually are deviating from our normal, most direct route so that you all can get a glimpse of this. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen at about 11:14. \xc2\xa0So we might still be engaged in the gaggle at that point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Deviating for us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re deviating for the President and for you all. \xc2\xa0So this is a view that will feature Joshua Tree National Park and Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail -- one of the most well-known and iconic long-distance hiking trails in the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I have one more scheduling announcement for all of you. \xc2\xa0On March 28th, the President will speak at the Toner Prize dinner in Washington, D.C., which, as you all know, honors excellence in political reporting. \xc2\xa0The Toner journalism program at Syracuse University, and the awards given out at the dinner, honor the late Robin Toner, who, as we all know, was the first woman to be the national political correspondent for the New York Times. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is deeply looking forward to this event at which he will underscore -- well, he will not only pay tribute to Robin\xe2\x80\x99s work, but also underscore his commitment -- underscore her commitment to journalistic excellence. \xc2\xa0Obviously, as you know, Robin covered political campaigns, covered policy issues, and really represented the best of journalism. \xc2\xa0And the President is looking forward to that event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I follow up on that? \xc2\xa0The President has talked in just recent days about all the misinformation that\xe2\x80\x99s put online, and said even on news broadcasts. \xc2\xa0He seems to have, in other times in the past, has sort of called the reporting that\xe2\x80\x99s going on this day and age into question. \xc2\xa0Will he make those points? \xc2\xa0And is that sort of one of the reasons he wants to talk at this, to sort of maybe raise the quality of coverage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the remarks for the President have been written yet for that event. \xc2\xa0But I do expect the President to engage in a conversation about where our media is and the importance of making sure that we have thoughtful, reflective public discussions on a lot of the pressing issues facing our country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, can I just ask on the national monuments -- there\xe2\x80\x99s another major several-million-acre site called Bears Ears, which I believe is in Utah, that Native Americans and others are pushing the President to consider designating as a national monument before he leaves office. \xc2\xa0Can you give me any update on his thinking on that? \xc2\xa0Is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s actively under consideration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Mark, beyond the 1.8 million acres that were designated today, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on future determinations. \xc2\xa0I do know that this is something that the President has appreciated and obviously has utilized his authority under the Antiquities Act. \xc2\xa0We can check to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any updates on any pending determinations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Senator Menendez\xe2\x80\x99s North Korea sanctions bill cleared Congress today. \xc2\xa0Will the President sign that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Darlene, like many members of Congress, the administration is deeply concerned about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s recent actions and the serious setback that this test represents. \xc2\xa0As I think my colleague, Ben Rhodes, said over the past day, that we\xe2\x80\x99re philosophically and intellectually in the same place as the Congress on this. \xc2\xa0So that will not be a bill that we oppose. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he sign it while he\xe2\x80\x99s -- before ASEAN? \xc2\xa0Will he sign it via autopen?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the bill has been sent to us yet. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There is a deal in Munich with regard to Syria yesterday that will lead to a temporary ceasefire, but not for a good -- apparently not for a week. \xc2\xa0Is the administration concerned that having that week will just allow Assad and his Russian backers to make progress in areas that will push back the rebels and the people, or the side that the U.S. is trying to support?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, as you referenced, Secretary Kerry announced in Munich last night that we have agreed to accelerate and expand the delivery of humanitarian aid. \xc2\xa0And that begins immediately. \xc2\xa0We have also announced agreement to implement a nationwide cessation of hostilities to begin in a target of one week. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTo enforce this, we\xe2\x80\x99ve established a taskforce under the auspices of the United Nations that will develop the mechanisms for enforcement. \xc2\xa0And I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re getting at is that this was an important step, but the work is far from over. \xc2\xa0Clearly, this is complicated. \xc2\xa0And in the coming days, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking for actions, not words, that demonstrate that all parties are prepared to honor their commitments and use their influence to see that these commitments are implemented on the ground in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- I think as you mentioned, Russia played a role in these talks, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen Russia play a destructive role on the ground and from the air in Syria. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve contributed to the humanitarian crisis that we see, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve also been targeting areas where there\xe2\x80\x99s very little or almost no ISIL presence at all. \xc2\xa0So it is time for them to stop using the cover of going after ISIL to become more involved in a Syrian sectarian civil war.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What I was specifically getting at is the fact that this is not officially going to start for a week. \xc2\xa0Essentially, a gift to Assad and Russia to make critical progress, which they appear about to do in their military campaign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, Jeff, obviously we have called for an immediate ceasefire before, and those calls were not heeded by the players involved. \xc2\xa0So you are right that -- well, the agreement in Munich that was reached last night is an important step, but you are right that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to be done. \xc2\xa0So, over the coming days, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners in the region, and we call on Russia to do the same to make sure that we can cease hostilities as soon as possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last June, the President stayed overnight in Los Angeles and met with two Hollywood bigwigs, Jeff Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg. \xc2\xa0It was not on his schedule. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us if the President met last night, once he got to the hotel, with any donors or Hollywood producers, or anybody else?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure, David. \xc2\xa0I think you all were with the President for a pretty extended day yesterday -- four different events. \xc2\xa0And as the protected pool, you accompany the President when he is out in public. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you that I am going to protect the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to have private conversations, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s with lawmakers, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s with candidates for President, or whether that\xe2\x80\x99s with Hollywood artists. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So he did?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any private conversations to read out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s possible, though?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any private conversations to read out. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic. \xc2\xa0I think the Democratic National Committee, it\xe2\x80\x99s been reported today, has rolled back some restrictions on donations to the party from PACs and so on. \xc2\xa0And I wondered if the White House has a reaction. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some commentary already that this sort of flies in the face of some of the reforms the President has talked about and campaigned on, even if it might help someone like Hillary Clinton.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0David, where was that reported? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Yes, happy to discuss this a little bit. \xc2\xa0But the guidelines that had previously been in place at the DNC were guidelines that were instituted when the President -- when Barack Obama, then-Senator Obama, became the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. \xc2\xa0Those were guidelines that were modeled after his campaign for the presidency. \xc2\xa0And again, those were steps that no previous nominee or candidate had taken before him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen Barack Obama became President, those guidelines stayed in place. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re now at a point where the fundraising for the DNC is going towards candidates who are on the ballot in 2016. \xc2\xa0As the President has remarked several times, he will not be on the ballot in 2016. \xc2\xa0So those candidates will have to make choices about the resources that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be raising. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he support this move?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Well, I will say that even under the new guidelines, there will be no lobbyists or people representing PACs at events attended by the administration. \xc2\xa0So that includes the President or Vice President or other administration officials. \xc2\xa0So the events you all attended -- accompanied the President to over these past two days, the makeup of those did not change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, in the last couple of days, an Iranian official has been quoted in some media overseas as asserting that an unnamed Republican from the United States spoke with Iranian officials and requested that they delay the release of Americans until after the election. \xc2\xa0Is the White House aware of these reports? \xc2\xa0Is the White House aware that there\xe2\x80\x99s any validity to the reports?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I saw a report on that, but we have no reason to believe that\xe2\x80\x99s true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Eric, I want to ask you about Russia. \xc2\xa0Apparently, the Deputy Secretary of Energy said that Russia was behind the cyber-attack on Ukraine that took out their power grid in December. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if the White House has a reaction to that report, and if you can confirm that Russia was, in fact, involved in that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Toluse, I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that. \xc2\xa0I did see a report on that. \xc2\xa0But the folks who look into this for us are the FBI and Department of State, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to those agencies. \xc2\xa0They have much more insight into where this stands.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one question on ISIL. \xc2\xa0Apparently, Speaker Ryan said that, by Monday, under the NDAA, the administration has to put forward a plan to defeat ISIL. \xc2\xa0Is that something that you all are planning to put out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I saw the Speaker tweeted about that. \xc2\xa0And I can tell you that -- I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s a product that\xe2\x80\x99s produced from the State Department and the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0So in terms of when that is transmitted to the Hill, you should check in with those agencies. \xc2\xa0But I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s rich for the Speaker to be calling for an instrument to describe our approach to taking out the threat posed by ISIL, when, after a year and a day, they have failed to come up with an ISIL-specific AUMF.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know if the President was briefed or updated on -- there was a shooting at a Phoenix-area school, where two 15-year-old girls were killed? \xc2\xa0And there was also another shooting in Ohio, at a restaurant, overnight. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think it was a machete attack. \xc2\xa0Columbus?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Machete attack, right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has been briefed on those. \xc2\xa0I do know that the President is regularly updated as warranted. \xc2\xa0Obviously, both of those situations are tragic, and we send our condolences to the families of the victims.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How engaged is the President on this Syria agreement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How engaged is the President on the Syria agreement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I can tell you the President is deeply engaged. \xc2\xa0The President has been briefed as the agreement was reached. \xc2\xa0I can also tell you that he has directed Secretary Kerry to be the primary negotiator on this. \xc2\xa0So I know that our team at the White House has been in touch with our counterparts at the State Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Week ahead?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ: \xc2\xa0Week ahead, yes. \xc2\xa0Darlene, as you know, on Monday and Tuesday of this week, the President will host a summit with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at Sunnylands. \xc2\xa0This will be a continuation of important conversations about the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0Following the conclusion of that summit, the President will, A, have a press conference, and B, return to Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd on Thursday, the President will welcome the Chicago Blackhawks to the White House to honor the team on their 2015 Stanley Cup victory. \xc2\xa0Afterward, the President and First Lady will host a reception celebrating Black History Month in the East Room.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President will meet with the Democratic governors at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd on Sunday, the President will deliver remarks at the National Governors Association dinner and reception at the White House. \xc2\xa0The First Lady will also attend that event on Sunday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t11:20 A.M. PST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
