Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I actually wanted to follow up on one piece of business from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I was asked at the end of the briefing -- Francesca, I think you asked this question -- about the prospect of the President possibly being partisan by raising the no-fly, no-buy loophole in his address to the nation. And I pointed out to you at the time that there are Republicans who supported this.\xc2\xa0 And so I went back and did a little checking on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a loophole that Pete King described as \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 John Kasich, Republican candidate for president, said, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the no-fly list, we probably could keep them from getting guns and ought to ban them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And even Governor Chris Christie, another Republican candidate for president, said about the no-fly, no-buy loophole, \xe2\x80\x9cIn theory, I don\'t have a huge problem with it.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now, considering that Governor Christie has a huge problem with just about everything the administration does, that\'s saying something.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCongressman King actually put forward legislation on this, I believe it was in the previous Congress.\xc2\xa0 Among the cosponsors was Bob Dold from Illinois, Daniel Donovan from New York, Leonard Lance from New Jersey, Chris Smith from New Jersey, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida.\xc2\xa0 One thing that all those members of Congress have in common, they\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is something that has bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 It is something that is consistent with common sense.\xc2\xa0 And for the sake of our national security, as I mentioned in Paris a little over a week ago, before Congress goes home for the holidays they should pass legislation to close the no-fly, no-buy loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Darlene, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Ryan says that they will likely have to pass a short-term CR this week.\xc2\xa0 And I know there was a little back-and-forth about this in the briefing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Could you be a little clearer about whether the President would sign legislation like that, to give them another day or two to work through the mechanics if that\xe2\x80\x99s what they need?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have been clear that if members of Congress needed an extra day or two in order to pass legislation, that the President would ensure the government didn\xe2\x80\x99t shut down while they were going through the legislative mechanics of passing a bipartisan budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 But Congress has had ample time to negotiate, and the only thing that\'s blocking negotiations right now is the insistence on the part of Republicans to use the budgetary process to advance their stalled ideological agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s not appropriate.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is not an appropriate way to manage the affairs of the greatest country in the world.\xc2\xa0 And the President is not going to sign a piece of legislation to give them more time to negotiate on a set of ideological riders. Those ideological riders should not be a part of the process.\xc2\xa0 What should be part of the process is finding common ground to pass a budget on time that adequately funds our national security priorities, of course, but also our economic priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tI hope that clarifies a little bit what our stance is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 And I think at this point they\xe2\x80\x99re just talking about having to work through the weekend before they can wrap this up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Hope you\'re right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Donald Trump, his proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S., can you say if the President will be doing anything more beyond what he said in the speech on Sunday in terms of calling for tolerance towards Muslims?\xc2\xa0 Will he be talking about this more?\xc2\xa0 Will he be maybe having some sort of a public meeting with Muslims, maybe traveling to a Muslim community to sort of counter the sentiment against Muslims that seems to be growing in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any updates to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule about this.\xc2\xa0 And as you point out, this is something the President has talked about quite extensively, and most recently in his address to the nation on Sunday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just step back and say that the Trump campaign for months now has had a dustbin-of-history-like quality to it, from the vacuous sloganeering to the outright lies to even the fake hair -- the whole carnival barker routine that we\'ve seen for some time now.\xc2\xa0 The question now is about the rest of the Republican Party and whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be dragged into the dustbin of history with him.\xc2\xa0 And right now, the current trajectory is not very good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier this year, House Republicans elected to their leadership somebody who famously bragged to a reporter that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Duke without the baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Earlier this month, we saw the executive director of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee was advising candidates about how they could ride the Trump wave. And just today -- today -- the newly elected Speaker of the House said that he would vote for Donald Trump for president if he\xe2\x80\x99s the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I know that each of the Republican candidates has already taken an oath pledging to support Donald Trump for president of the United States if he wins the nomination.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is the first thing a president does when he or she takes the oath of office is to swear an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. \xc2\xa0And the fact is that what Donald Trump said yesterday disqualifies him from serving as president.\xc2\xa0 And for Republican candidates for president to stand by their pledge to support Mr. Trump, that in and of itself is disqualifying.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are Speaker Ryan and other Republicans supposed to do if Trump -- let\xe2\x80\x99s say Trump does end up winning the nomination.\xc2\xa0 Would you like them not to support him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They should say right now that they would not support Donald Trump for president.\xc2\xa0 What he said is disqualifying.\xc2\xa0 And any Republican who\xe2\x80\x99s too fearful of the Republican base to admit it has no business serving as president either.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A lot of details have emerged about the investigation of the San Bernardino shooting with increasing frequency about who may have supplied the weapons, who these people may have been in touch with.\xc2\xa0 I know you made very clearly you\xe2\x80\x99re not in a place to confirm any of those details, but can you just talk us through how frequently the President is being updated on this investigation and who is updating him?\xc2\xa0 Is it Director Comey of the FBI?\xc2\xa0 Is it his Homeland Security Secretary?\xc2\xa0 Just walk us through those discussions and how frequently they\xe2\x80\x99re happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that the President is frequently being updated on this.\xc2\xa0 The President gets a national security briefing every morning in the Oval Office at the start of his schedule.\xc2\xa0 And I know that this ongoing threat and this act of terror is a part of those discussions, and a host of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team participates in those -- a group of officials from the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team participate in those conversations.\xc2\xa0 So there is a mechanism for him to get regular updates, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that if he\xe2\x80\x99s seeking more information or feels the desire for an additional piece of information that he won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to pick up the phone and call his Attorney General or call his FBI Director or call the Director of the Counterterrorism Center.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So once a day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at least, I guess is the way that I\xe2\x80\x99d describe it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also following on the omnibus discussion, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion on the Hill about including a measure in the omnibus that would lift the ban on crude oil exports.\xc2\xa0 Would the President veto an omnibus bill specifically for including that measure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I mentioned earlier, there are a host of things that are out there that are being considered for inclusion in the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 The one thing that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited is obviously a provision, a legislative provision that the administration has consistently opposed.\xc2\xa0 Our position on that is we continue to oppose that legislative provision.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to get into sort of a detailed list of all the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to veto or not veto.\xc2\xa0 Our position on that is firm -- we oppose it.\xc2\xa0 We also oppose other things that have been floated for possible inclusion on the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 And we have been aggressively advocating to Republicans in Congress that they should focus on the budgetary priorities of the country and not try to advance ideological aspects of their agenda that have been stalled other places.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, ultimately, what we need to see is we need Congress to pass a budget before the end of the year -- or before the end of this week -- so that the national security and economic priorities of the country can be fully funded on time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously he opposes this, as you said, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying yet whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to sink an omnibus bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say at this point, on a one-off basis, all of the variety of things that have been floated for potential inclusion in the bill about whether or not they would be potential deal-breakers.\xc2\xa0 Our position continues to be that Republicans should not seek to use the budgetary process inappropriately to advance the most controversial aspects of their ideological agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Trump.\xc2\xa0 Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security Secretary, said today that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric is actually harmful to America\xe2\x80\x99s national security.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that?\xc2\xa0 And why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And the President described this at some length in his speech on Sunday night.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, ISIL is trying to advance a narrative that suggests that they represent the religion of Islam in waging a war against the United States and the West.\xc2\xa0 That narrative is false.\xc2\xa0 It is a fantasy.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that millions of Muslims are actually on the side of the United States and our international coalition in trying to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There are Muslim Americans serving in our Armed Forces right now, putting their lives on the line for our national security.\xc2\xa0 And to suggest otherwise only advances the narrative of ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this, his rhetoric -- do you fear that his rhetoric actually will turn some Muslims in this country against this country because of the way that he is talking about Muslims who normally would not have been involved in perhaps the radicalism that some are?\xc2\xa0 Will this, in fact, backfire and hurt the country in that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly do believe that this is harmful to the country and it\xe2\x80\x99s contrary to our values.\xc2\xa0 Let me just say that as offensive and toxic as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric is, it does not condone or justify any act of violence.\xc2\xa0 But the concern that we have -- and, again, this is something the President said in his speech on Sunday night -- is that the United States government and our national security officials are going to be most effective if they\xe2\x80\x99re able to work in partnership with leaders of the Muslim American community to prevent those who are most vulnerable to this radical ISIL ideology from being incited and inspired to carry out an act of violence.\xc2\xa0 And rhetoric, like the offensive bluster that we hear from Mr. Trump, makes it much harder to build and solidify that relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, is it practical -- in any way, is his plan practical?\xc2\xa0 Could, in fact, the administration -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s your administration or his administration -- prevent and find out who\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim and who\xe2\x80\x99s not, from coming in this country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, that sounds like a good question for him.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hear a lot from Mr. Trump that seems far-fetched and unrealistic in addition to being grotesque and offensive.\xc2\xa0 So I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has made quite clear his view that imposing some kind of religious test on those seeking to enter or even return to the United States runs counter to the Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to Trump rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 You say it\xe2\x80\x99s harmful -- you agreed that it\xe2\x80\x99s harmful to the national security of this nation.\xc2\xa0 Has this White House had to talk to world leaders about what Trump had to -- has this White House had to defuse some of the rhetoric and some of the height of this anger and talk to world leaders about it since he made the statements?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- in the last 12 or 18 hours, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations with world leaders that have been focused on this issue, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you getting from leaders in Muslim countries from this rhetoric?\xc2\xa0 What are you hearing?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit of tick-tock, some of the information you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from embassies or from the world leaders themselves coming here about what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this may come as a source of some disappointment to Mr. Trump, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they\xe2\x80\x99re paying that much attention to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been so eloquent in describing Mr. Trump and what he\xe2\x80\x99s done, what really was the push to say he disqualifies himself at this point?\xc2\xa0 I mean, because he talked about Mexicans and this wall with this pretty door.\xc2\xa0 What was really the final nail in the coffin for him to say he is disqualified as a presidential candidate?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve had ample time to do it before.\xc2\xa0 Why now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly has been an accumulation of offensive and incendiary comments from Mr. Trump.\xc2\xa0 This is only the latest.\xc2\xa0 But, again, if your first act as President is to put your hand on the Bible and swear an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, the kind of policy -- if I could call it that -- that Mr. Trump is advocating is entirely inconsistent with the values that are enshrined in our Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we hear President Obama come out specifically at any time -- speaking of Donald Trump and his rhetoric, since you are calling him by name now, something that you don\xe2\x80\x99t like doing and you kind of dismiss him but today you\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about where this White House stands on Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific plans for the President to address this directly.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past, Trump would say something controversial, somewhere on the scale of controversy, you would always say, well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into it, it\xe2\x80\x99s all rhetoric, I believe that a robust debate is good for this country, good for democracy.\xc2\xa0 So is Trump now not good for this country and not good for democracy, along with his rhetoric?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is not the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed something offensive that Mr. Trump has had to say.\xc2\xa0 But I think many people have observed something materially different about his comments from last night.\xc2\xa0 And coming on the backend of an accumulation of offensive comments, it is clear that what he\xe2\x80\x99s said is disqualifying.\xc2\xa0 And for the other Republican candidates who have pledged to support him, it\xe2\x80\x99s disqualifying for them to continue to hold that position.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo support somebody for the presidency who articulates these views I think is a pretty clear indication that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the right judgment to serve as president of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is an indication that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the courage of your convictions to stand up and speak out when something so offensive is uttered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s an accumulation of things culminating in what he said yesterday, that\xe2\x80\x99s what put you over the edge in terms of this not just being rhetoric or debate that\xe2\x80\x99s good for America?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, and I think the Secretary of Homeland Security indicated that it was contrary to our national security interests and makes it harder to defend the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is no longer debate that\xe2\x80\x99s good for America and good for democracy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we should have a robust debate about foreign policy in this country.\xc2\xa0 And the President alluded to that, even, in his address on Sunday night.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that we should have a debate about what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect the country, about the best strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But that should be a debate about policy that reflects the values of this country that are enshrined in our Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what Mr. Trump said runs directly counter to those values.\xc2\xa0 It undermines them.\xc2\xa0 It tarnishes them.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why so many Americans find them offensive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is no longer -- you think this is beyond robust debate that is good for this country -- is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, people will -- it certainly -- let me just go back to where I was here, which is that what Mr. Trump said is deeply offensive and, as the Secretary of Homeland Security said, has consequences for our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the real question for the Republican Party and for the Republican candidates is are they going to be dragged into the dustbin of history along with Donald Trump?\xc2\xa0 And right now, if you look at the current state of the Republican Party, one of their leaders in Congress is somebody who bragged about -- reportedly bragged to a reporter about being \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Duke without the baggage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got somebody at the Republican Senate Campaign Committee trying to design a strategy that will allow Republican candidates across the country to benefit from Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s incendiary and offensive rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 And you have the Speaker of the House saying that he\xe2\x80\x99d vote for Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 So that does not indicate that the Republican Party has joined the rest of us in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, so many things that have been said have been passed off as just it\xe2\x80\x99s a campaign year and this is rhetoric.\xc2\xa0 So how is this not just -- okay, you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in it; you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\xc2\xa0 So how is this not to you just rhetoric that should be brushed aside as something that would, in your opinion, be ridiculous?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s morally reprehensible.\xc2\xa0 It runs counter to the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And it has consequences for our national security.\xc2\xa0 And the problem is, is you still have a bunch of Republican candidates who are standing by their pledge to support him for president of the United States if, in fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s nominated by the Republican Party to do so.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a problem.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s leading by so much in the polls also must tell you that many, many Americans agree with everything he\xe2\x80\x99s been saying, at least up until this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, staying on this -- fortunately or unfortunately\xc2\xa0 -- when Trump made his remarks in South Carolina last night, he was greeted with a standing ovation.\xc2\xa0 There is a sizable portion of the population -- the statistics are all over the place -- but these people exist who believe that Islam is incompatible with American values; that Islam should be illegal inside the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s response on Sunday, or his statement on Sunday largely presented a reasonable and rational argument to this that may not find quarter with those Americans.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s the President for those Americans, too.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s message to those who would stand up and applaud Mr. Trump who would believe that Islam should be illegal inside the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the message that we\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered has been quite consistent over the last seven years, and a religious test like the one that Mr. Trump is suggesting runs directly counter to the Constitution and, as the Secretary of Homeland Security indicated, has negative consequences for our homeland security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you\xe2\x80\x99re making an argument that\xe2\x80\x99s based on what this administration believes is a rational basis but the opposition to your argument is stoking fear, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like the rationale is always winning out.\xc2\xa0 Can the President reach those Americans that he represents who are afraid and may find some solace in the arguments being presented by Trump and plenty of others?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I feel confident standing here today, Jared, and telling you that the vast majority of Americans believe in defending the values that are enshrined in our Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back to the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 The other crisis -- (laughter) -- government shutdown in four days.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have also prepared a tax extender package, which is typical for the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House seen the tax package?\xc2\xa0 Is it acceptable?\xc2\xa0 And would it be okay if that were on omnibus package as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House is aware of the ongoing conversations on Capitol Hill between Democrats and Republicans about this so-called tax extenders package.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, Congress will have to make their own determination about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in that legislation and what the best way to pass it is.\xc2\xa0 Our principle in general on those kinds of measures has been to insist upon relief for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And the tendency for Republicans is to focus on relief for special interests and big businesses in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 And our position, and our passion for looking out for the middle class is not going to take a backseat in those negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, right now, those negotiations are taking place on Capitol Hill between Democrats and Republicans, and I\'ve got a lot of confidence that the Democratic members of Congress who are participating in that debate have the same passion for the middle class that the President does.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'ll see what eventually they\xe2\x80\x99re able to come up with, if anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s your understanding right now is it\'s not fully finished yet, that there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that those conversations are ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also along that -- Republicans and others on Capitol Hill have a proposal they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to attach to legislation that would delay these fiduciary rules the administration would like to put in place -- the rules that would require investment advisors to act in the best interest of retirees when investing their savings.\xc2\xa0 Is there any kind of delay in this that you folks would find acceptable even if it were a lesser delay than what they want?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we know that this is a rule that\xe2\x80\x99s been under consideration by the Department of Labor for some time now that the President believes is important.\xc2\xa0 This is a rule that essentially requires investment advisors to act in the best interest of their clients when giving advice on retirement accounts.\xc2\xa0 Right now, because this rule isn\'t in place, the estimate is that billions of dollars every year is lost because this rule is not in place.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re looking to put the rule in place to protect that money and protect the hard-earned investments of working people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe factor for us that is paramount here is that those investment advisors who are already doing the right thing, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impose an additional burden on them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we believe this is a common-sense rule; it\'s consistent with the values and priorities that the President outlined, which includes giving more middle-class Americans access to a retirement with dignity.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'re going to aggressively oppose any effort by Republicans to water down that rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And any delay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are going to aggressively oppose any effort by Republicans to water down that rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now a separate, maybe -- governing question.\xc2\xa0 As you well know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a visa waiver legislation up on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration back that legislation in its current form?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding, Mike, is there are actually a couple different proposals that are out there.\xc2\xa0 There is one in the House that does have bipartisan support, and that is something that I previously indicated the administration supports.\xc2\xa0 So this is still working its way through the process, but our position on that legislation has not changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, there are a few U.S. diplomats scheduled to be in Islamabad today.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that Pakistan has been helpful so far in this inquiry into the attacks in San Bernardino, given that one of the attackers is a Pakistani national?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, this is something that the Attorney General was asked about on Sunday and she refrained from specifically describing the level of coordination that we\'ve gotten from a variety of international partners in investigating this incident, and so for that reason, I\'m going to be loath to delve into any of the details of those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you give us -- given the interest of blocking people from entering the United States, perhaps talk to us about some of the ways that you\'re looking on a security basis to block some of those trying to get access through K1 and all that?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at and called for a review of the standards.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any kind of timeline on what the White House expects from DHS and from State on pointing out loopholes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say this a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 I would draw a distinction between the religious test that Mr. Trump apparently wants to institute for those who are entering the United States and the improved -- or reforms that could improve the screening process for those seeking to enter the United States using the K1 visa program, regardless of their religion.\xc2\xa0 So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty significant difference between what Mr. Trump is advocating and what the President has tasked his team with working on.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have an update for you in terms of the timeline when that review would be completed or a set of reforms would be proposed.\xc2\xa0 But given the events of the last week or so, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of urgency about conducting that review and completing it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when you say a sense of urgency that is a tacit acknowledgment that there are perhaps some weaknesses in the existing program?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is an explicit acknowledgment that this is, at a minimum, something that we need to check out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you also -- taking a step back, looking at the comments that we have seen from others today, Speaker Ryan did come out and say the way Donald Trump is talking is not reflective of conservative as he sees it.\xc2\xa0 You also had --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, why would he say that he would vote for him?\xc2\xa0 That\'s what I don\'t understand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of the commentary and the need to condemn these comments, you\xe2\x80\x99ve also had other Republican presidential candidates out there -- Lindsey Graham, one of the more colorful ones -- condemning these remarks.\xc2\xa0 Do you, at a minimum, see this kind of condemnation as helpful in terms of what you are seeing from some Republican candidates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is those comments don\'t mean that much if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to go ahead and vote for him.\xc2\xa0 And so I think what we need to see is a definitive statement from every candidate for the presidency about whether or not Mr. Trump is somebody that they could vote for.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s as simple as that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if they are willing to walk the walk when it comes to their news releases or the tweets that are submitted by their campaign then they should say so.\xc2\xa0 And by the way, it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that long -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot to analyze about what Mr. Trump has said.\xc2\xa0 And I think their statements about this pledge that they have taken to support Mr. Trump will speak volumes, as will the silence if nobody says anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you want to hear something perhaps not only more direct about not voting but maybe you need something from the RNC?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what exactly are you looking for people to come out and say in terms of distancing themselves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now, what we need to hear from the other Republican candidates for president is whether or not they could vote for Mr. Trump.\xc2\xa0 What he has said is entirely disqualifying from serving as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And to continue to stand by him and pledge your support to him if he were to become the Republican nominee is, in and of itself, disqualifying.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I think people are going to be interested to hear what the candidates have to say about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is continuing to support him as a possible candidate itself a threat to national security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99d quite go that far.\xc2\xa0 I think that his comments, again, based on what the Secretary of Homeland Security has said, aren\'t helpful to our national security. \xc2\xa0And I think the question for other members of -- other candidates for president is simply this:\xc2\xa0 Do they have the courage of their convictions to stand up to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters and say that they are going to side with the Constitution over Mr. Trump even if Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if they don\'t, if they don\'t have that much courage, if they are so cowed by Mr. Trump and his supporters that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to stand by the values enshrined in the Constitution, then they have no business serving as president of the United States themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he take a step back -- I mean, all of us here have asked a question, it would seem with very few exceptions, about Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 Do you think -- when you were coming out here, did you weigh this, saying am I helping to elevate him?\xc2\xa0 Am I helping to elevate what is political rhetoric to a higher state?\xc2\xa0 Because I know you do think seriously about what you are willing to say from the podium --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of the White House.\xc2\xa0 Why is it important to come from this podium this message?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because we\'re talking about values that are fundamental to the creation of this country.\xc2\xa0 And those are values that people who have stood at this podium, representing both parties, have long defended.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the responsibility of anybody that stands up here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what my comments today reflect.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do you think this endures?\xc2\xa0 Why do you think -- and, again, it would be easy to dismiss Mr. Trump because of what he said and -- but the reality is, is that he, months and months later -- and there is this group of people out there -- I guess we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out soon how large they are or not -- why does that endure?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about what he might need to do now going forward to really deal with that particular mindset in the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One reason it endures is because you have a bunch of people in the Republican Party who say they\xe2\x80\x99d vote for him for President.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about people who are answering polls.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the other candidates who stand with him on the stage on debate night.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the chair of the RNC.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the leadership of House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the strategists at the Republican Campaign Committee who are trying to figure out the best way to maximize the advantage for their candidates if Mr. Trump is their nominee.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that he endures.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s at least part of the explanation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it also something about what people are thinking and feeling?\xc2\xa0 Fear?\xc2\xa0 Is this -- we live in an age now where there\xe2\x80\x99s greater income inequality than ever before.\xc2\xa0 Arguably, that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be part of it, too, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that Mr. Trump has been rather cynical in appealing to people\xe2\x80\x99s fears and anxieties, and that has proven, at least in the short term, to be an effective strategy for advancing his own narrow political ambitions.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not good for our homeland security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with the values enshrined in the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s why Mr. Trump risks pulling the entire Republican Party into the dustbin of history with him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last topic.\xc2\xa0 The no-fly, no-buy law.\xc2\xa0 You said -- you talked about it as a national security issue.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you did that before the incident in San Bernardino or not, but the other gun control issues that the President -- or gun safety measures that the President has been talking about, does he see them as well as national security issues, like background checks and -- or is this something that\xe2\x80\x99s just in a different category by itself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did previously describe the no-fly, no-buy loophole as a national security issue prior to the situation in San Bernardino.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President would say, based on his comments from Sunday night, is that we are seeing extremist organizations, including ISIL, trying to radicalize people in the United States to essentially mimic the tactics of other mass shooters in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there certainly is a national security benefit associated with, for example, closing the gun show loophole, or reinstating the assault weapons ban -- some common-sense measures that enjoy the broad support of the country and, according to some polls, even the majority support of gun owners in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, that\xe2\x80\x99s why there is such profound frustration on the part of the President that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken common-sense steps that would make it harder for those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get guns from getting their hands on them, primarily because the suggestion is not that we be able to stop every single incident of violence in this country, but if there are some common-sense things that we can do that might at least make some of them less likely, then why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we do it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is a national security issue, but as Commander-in-Chief, is he more likely now, do you think, to use his executive authority to try to make some of these things happen?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest in this has been -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 The intensity of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view about the importance of us implementing some policies that make it harder for those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get their hands on guns from getting them has not waned in its intensity.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about common-sense measures like making sure that you can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid a background check just by purchasing the gun over the Internet, or even reinstituting the assault weapons ban that would prevent or at least reduce the likelihood that weapons of war end up on our streets.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that those weapons claim thousands of innocent lives every day, even when it\xe2\x80\x99s not connected to terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that -- he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do everything that he possibly can, using his own executive authority, to weigh in on this.\xc2\xa0 But the easiest way for this to get done is for Congress to rely on their own common sense and make the country safer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been reluctant to say anything about the work of this group that\xe2\x80\x99s scrubbing the laws and so forth.\xc2\xa0 Has the San Bernardino incident in any way intensified their efforts, focused their efforts?\xc2\xa0 Or is there -- are we now more likely to hear something about that or about what the President might do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, quite frankly, because their efforts were intense already, and their intensity continues to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to sort of follow up on something Ron was asking about.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For those on the Hill who would say, listen, this President has been pretty successful at getting some things done in Congress -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Obamacare, debt limit -- I could go down a long list of successes.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s happened here?\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been able to move the ball on gun legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, Kevin, the President has talked about this, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a source of some frustration, primarily because the President knows and public polling indicates that a majority of the country agrees with his view, including a majority of gun owners, according to some surveys.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are some common-sense things that Congress could do that would not undermine the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans\xc2\xa0 but yet would make it a little bit harder for criminals, for example, to get their hands on guns.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why the failure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think part of it is that there are an inordinate number of members of Congress who are terrified of the NRA.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.\xc2\xa0 I think the second thing -- and this is a little bit more of a raw political analysis that the President himself has done -- but you have this minority -- again, according to the polls -- who have much more intensely expressed their opposition to those common-sense gun safety measures than supporters of those measures have.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been pretty candid that until we see the same intensity on the side of gun safety, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely Congress will move.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt remains to be seen if the incidents that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen more recently -- this terrible shooting at the community college in Oregon, the assault on the Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs, or even this terrible incident -- this terrible terrorist attack in San Bernardino -- if that will be enough to prompt congressional action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about AUMF.\xc2\xa0 Does the President enjoy full support from his own party to get a new AUMF? \xc2\xa0If not, why not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty crystal-clear that we need to see Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill come together and finally vote to authorize the use of military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Right now, the President has the legal authority that he needs under the 2001 AUMF that Congress passed that does give him the authority that he needs to order the actions that are currently underway.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s been some pushback from even some Democrats who say this thing in Syria with sending Special Operators -- maybe he\xe2\x80\x99s gone beyond the intention of the 2001?\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, our lawyers make crystal-clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate, given the 2001 AUMF.\xc2\xa0 But what we would like to see is Congress fulfill their responsibility.\xc2\xa0 We hear a lot of carping and a lot of second-guessing from members of Congress about what our counter-ISIL strategy should be.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic for them to be complaining when it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to point to a single step right now that Congress has taken in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The President ordered military action against ISIL more than a year ago, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- at least off the top of my head, I can\xe2\x80\x99t name a single thing that Congress has done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ve got four things that Congress can do.\xc2\xa0 Congress can pass a reform of the Visa Waiver Program.\xc2\xa0 That would make the country a little bit safer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They are --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And they are working on that, to their credit, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have indicated our support for.\xc2\xa0 So maybe that would be the one thing they would get done.\xc2\xa0 But there are three other things that we believe they could get done before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 They could confirm Adam Szubin -- this is the financial expert that the President has nominated to lead the effort to shut off ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who served both Democratic and Republican Presidents, and there is nobody in Congress who has expressed any misgivings about his expertise or his ability to do the job.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third thing is we could see from Congress full funding of our aviation security efforts that would enhance our ability to do more screening of passengers overseas, before people board planes, entering in the United States.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that they could do this in the context of the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 That is, after all, a funding bill, so we would welcome that step.\xc2\xa0 And then the fourth thing is pass a bill that would close the no-fly, no-buy loophole.\xc2\xa0 Those are four things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fifth thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, Kevin, is the authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 The AUMF presumably would require more debate and that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably a debate they should have been having over the last year and a half, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, but if they want to start that now, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to wrap up that debate before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that those four other things that I mentioned are things that Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get done before they leave for the holidays.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing I want to ask about -- my apologies to my colleagues -- Donald Trump.\xc2\xa0 Interestingly, I was listening to Rachel -- she said something about maybe he is actually trying to implode his own campaign by being outrageous and just pushing the envelope as far and as wide as he can.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of that idea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve said on a number of occasions that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to understand exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xc2\xa0 But the impact of what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now is corrosive.\xc2\xa0 And I think the bigger problem in my mind is the way the rest of the Republican Party is not acting to make clear that they would never support him for President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99m exhausted all the Trump questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully so.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of fighting ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Sunday night, he said that one element is to call for a cease-fire in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Today, there is a meeting in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia of the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that -- is it possible to have this kind of representation without having armed groups who are calling the shot in Syria for this opposition to be selected and potentially to have negotiations with the regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nadia, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve put your finger on one aspect of this that is particularly difficult -- that one thing that we need to do to advance a political transition is just to organize the wide variety of opposition groups that currently exist inside of Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of controversy associated with which groups can be appropriately included in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 So I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that there are a lot of easy steps to be taken here, but the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to get 100 or so representatives of these groups in the same room to begin a discussion about the political transition inside of Syria is an important step -- and just the latest one.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d also note that Secretary Kerry, I believe earlier today, over in Paris, announced that the next meeting for the Syrian political process would actually take place in New York on December 18th.\xc2\xa0 That will, again, be another important conversation among world leaders to discuss this long overdue political transition inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 So there are some steps to indicate some forward progress, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave you with the impression that we think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be smooth sailing here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one related to the issue.\xc2\xa0 President Erdogan of Turkey also today said that he insisted on having safe havens for refugees in northern Syria.\xc2\xa0 Does this prompt the White House to change its thinking that it is maybe at that time to consider having these safe areas for Syrian refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nadia, this is an idea that President Erdogan has advocated for some time, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we continue to believe is not the best strategy for moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur concerns center primarily around the idea that establishing a safe zone like the one that he contemplates would require significant resources.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of having a few fighter jets patrolling the area -- after all, ISIL doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an air force.\xc2\xa0 What it would require is significant resources on the ground to secure the area.\xc2\xa0 And that would require a substantial commitment of ground troops that runs directly contrary to the strategy that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if you were to design a system that would somehow not require a substantial commitment from the United States in terms of ground troops or other resources, whatever resources were required would divert from the ongoing counter-ISIL effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, having, for example -- just to use the fighter jet example -- to dedicate fighter jets to patrolling the safe zone would mean pulling those fighter jets away from operations that potentially could be used to carry out strikes against ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 And the President all along has indicate we need to be focused on the ISIL effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 The DNC roundtable, which is closed, is there any particular agenda?\xc2\xa0 Or what\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is an effort to raise money for the Democratic National Committee that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, a fundraiser, okay.\xc2\xa0 I thought it said roundtable. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if it was some kind of -- a roundtable around here usually condones some policy wonking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Understood.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 My other question -- this might be a little nitpicky -- but in your prepared remarks, you said something that struck me as very Trump-ian and not very Obama-like, when you talked about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s fake hair.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hallmark of Trump, to comment on somebody -- your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s appearance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I would ever expect to come from the Obama White House.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious -- this was in your prepared remarks -- what was the thinking behind it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess I was describing why it would be easy for people to dismiss the Trump campaign as not particularly serious.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because of his hair?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because he\xe2\x80\x99s got a rather outrageous appearance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the kind of what he does to people and that\xe2\x80\x99s considered so out of line, when he talks about people\xe2\x80\x99s appearances?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a hallmark of his campaign and his identity, though.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to cite there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you know it\xe2\x80\x99s fake?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be fact-checked.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnita.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Did you have more, Mara?\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to cut you off.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask you a Trump question.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve been rather patient in indulging a large number of Trump questions today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you have something to say on the matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If only Republicans did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the omnibus, you earlier mentioned riders and amendments that you said were mucking up the process.\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid -- The Hill is reporting that Senator Reid has an amendment that he wants to put on a provision that would help Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s avoid bankruptcy by allowing it to restructure debt incurred by a subsidiary out of court, and it has not gone through the normal channels, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a hearing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also an amendment.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you consider that the same thing that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 Is it mucking up the process?\xc2\xa0 Do you support the amendment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details of the amendment.\xc2\xa0 The report that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing is the first time that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it.\xc2\xa0 It does sound a little -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound particularly ideological to me, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only based on what you\xe2\x80\x99ve read.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So amendments are okay if they go out of the process as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re not ideological?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we have indicated is that right now, what\xe2\x80\x99s gumming up the works here is the insistence on the part of Republicans to add ideological riders that are in some cases described as \xe2\x80\x9cpoison pills\xe2\x80\x9d to gum up the process.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to capitalize on the budgetary process that results in a must-pass piece of legislation to support an ideological agenda that -- or to advance an ideological agenda that can\xe2\x80\x99t otherwise make its way through the legislative process.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we object to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So not the process piece then?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not been uncommon -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on that specific amendment, just because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say in general that it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for omnibus budget bills to have other things attached to them.\xc2\xa0 The concern that we have is that right now, we\xe2\x80\x99re risking a government shutdown because Republicans are insisting on including ideologically motivated riders to that must-pass piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re preparing to shut down the government unless they get benefits for their biggest campaign contributors who don\xe2\x80\x99t support Wall Street reform or the Clean Power Plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s not an appropriate way to run the country, and it certainly is not consistent with the way the budget process is supposed to work.\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tLalit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 How closely is the President following negotiations on climate change in Paris?\xc2\xa0 And what is his take on the role of India and China being played in Paris right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President continues to follow this closely.\xc2\xa0 Many of you may have seen the written readout issued by the Press Office last night that the President concluded a telephone call with President Rousseff of Brazil to talk about the ongoing negotiations in Paris.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that earlier today, the President placed a telephone call to Prime Minister Modi of India to discuss the ongoing negotiations. And I would anticipate that over the course of this week, as the negotiations continue, the President would be in touch with other world leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s following this quite closely.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s getting regular updates from his team in Paris about the status of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he continues to follow closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he optimistic of a deal being reached there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, he is, but primarily for the reasons that he said when he was in Paris last week, which is we have -- even in advance of the Paris negotiations -- we saw the international community mobilize to make significant commitments to cut carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 More than 180 countries brought with them to Paris specific commitments to reduce carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 And those commitments were catalyzed by the historic agreement between the United States and China that was announced last fall to make significant reductions in the carbon pollution in our two countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the United States has been playing a leading role.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that leadership result in significant, specific commitments from a large number of countries, and we\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic about the eventual outcome.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President, on Sunday night, spoke about the important role that Muslim leaders have in terms of putting up a message that you can put up against ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to read to you some comments that the L.A. Director for the Council on American Islamic Relations said last on CNN.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we [the United States] support coup leaders in Egypt or other places, when we support dictatorship, or oppressive regimes around the world that push people over on the edge, then they become extremists and they become terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We are partly responsible.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And then he went on to say, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that some of our own foreign policy as Americans, as the West, have fueled that extremism.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with those comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing them for the first time.\xc2\xa0 Let me just say, in general, that the United States is an ardent advocate around the world for human rights.\xc2\xa0 And even when the President goes to places -- some of the countries that that individual was describing, we\xe2\x80\x99re quite candid about the degree to which the President advocates for basic universal human rights.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the second thing is there is nothing that justifies a terrible act of terrorism like what we saw in San Bernardino, particularly one that targets innocent civilians like we saw in that attack.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that justifies what they did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you call those comments that I just read out to you grossly irresponsible?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve just done my best to describe what our view is about what that individual stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you support Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment right to the Constitution to say what he said in the same manner that this religious leader from CAIR said what he said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have never, despite my extensive comments today, never once called into question Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s right to say it.\xc2\xa0 I do believe that it disqualifies him from serving as president of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But I have not called into question his First Amendment right to spew that offensive, hateful rhetoric that he frequently utters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one final question on a separate issue.\xc2\xa0 The President tomorrow is going to be meeting with the President of Israel.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a sense about what it is that they will be discussing during that meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I described this a little bit in the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an additional update about their agenda, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you something before the end of the day today.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Also on Sunday, the President, during his speech, called ISIS a group of thugs and killers, and called them -- cause of death.\xc2\xa0 Among the deeds committed by ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s anti-LGBT violence, such as throwing men perceived as gay from rooftops, one activist in Lebanon told the Washington Blade ISIS hanged a transgender woman in a Damascus suburb by her breasts.\xc2\xa0 Some LGBT advocates are calling for the Obama administration to set aside 500 slots in the anticipated 10,000 Syrian refugees for LGBT people.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the anti-LGBT persecution conducted by ISIS and will he reserve 500 slots -- direct the State Department to reserve 500 slots for LGBT refugees?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chris, the tactics of ISIL have shown a callous disregard for basic human rights.\xc2\xa0 And it is certainly no secret that there are a variety of ways in which they offend those basic rights and trample those rights.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons the President has mobilized such a strong international coalition to destroy them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to our refugee resettlement efforts, the United States does not set aside quotas like what you just described.\xc2\xa0 But what the United States does do, in terms of resettling refugees, is prioritize the cases of those who are deemed to be the most vulnerable -- those who have been subjected to acts of torture, those who have been singled out because of their minority status in one way or another.\xc2\xa0 And that is I think, again, a testament to the values of the United States and it also is another useful example to illustrate why essentially ending the refugee program is contrary to the basic values of this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to be clear, the instance of anti-LGBT persecution that I described would be considered a priority under the refugee program as you mentioned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are no quotas that are set aside, but the process that we have implemented does prioritize the cases of those who have been subjected to torture, including like the torture that you described, or might have been singled out for their status as a minority, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a racial minority or an ethnic minority or a religious minority, or even somebody -- an LGBT person.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s our policy and, again, I think it underscores the commitment of the United States to lead on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has strongly disagreed with the effort of some Republicans who have suggested that it would be in our interest to somehow shut down the program.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:53 P.M.
