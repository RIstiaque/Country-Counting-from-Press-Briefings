EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us.\xc2\xa0 I know you are as excited as I am about launching the bus tour the President will embark on through smaller communities in North Carolina and Virginia.\xc2\xa0 For the same reason we were excited about the bus tour through the upper Midwest -- Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois -- we are excited about this because it enables the President to get out into smaller communities that are hard to get access to normally and to meet with Americans, different communities bringing different perspectives to the challenges they face -- in this case, the economic challenges they face.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you know, will be focusing this trip on the American Jobs Act, the need for Congress to take action on the individual components of the jobs act.\xc2\xa0 We expect the Senate to take up the first measure from within the jobs act very soon. Hopefully, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will address that and make an announcement on that relatively soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we will, as promised, continue to press day in and day out Congress to act on these common-sense solutions to the problems we face right now economically, the need to get growth going, the need to get jobs creation moving.\xc2\xa0 It is unfortunate but true that so far the Republicans, while they have put forward plans, economic plans, have not put forward a plan that in any way would have a positive impact or measurably positive impact on economic growth or job creation in the next 12 to 18 months.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s simply a fact.\xc2\xa0 It\'s been assessed that way by outside economic analysts and many other observers, including journalists.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Senator Reid bringing up some announcement on the jobs plan.\xc2\xa0 Is this something you --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I said he would bring up part of the jobs act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the bill.\xc2\xa0 So is that something that the President knows he\'s going to make an announcement on this week?\xc2\xa0 Could you give us any more details?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously have been in conversations with Senator Reid, as well as other Senate leaders, about the plans to move forward with the American Jobs Act, addressing it in pieces as opposed to a whole, since the Republicans blocked passage of the entire jobs act.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, we are confident that Senator Reid will be able to say something about the scheduling of a vote in the relatively near future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it happen today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll leave it up to the Majority Leader to make that announcement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any guidance on which part is likely to come up first?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I want to let the Senate Majority Leader make that announcement because it\'s his prerogative to schedule it and to decide what initiative will come first.\xc2\xa0 It really doesn\'t matter to us, because they\'re all important, they\'re all of equal value -- whether it\'s the assistance to states and localities to put laid-off teachers back to work and support up to 400,000 jobs in the education field; whether it\'s the infrastructure money which will put construction workers to work in helping rebuild our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first event the President does today will focus on that component of the jobs act.\xc2\xa0 And then, of course, there are the tax provisions -- the extension and expansion of the payroll tax credit for individuals, which would go to 160 million Americans.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll these things would have a positive impact on growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the essence of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 There are other items, there are other economic policy proposals that the President, obviously, has put forward and others that he supports, some of which the Republicans have talked about.\xc2\xa0 And as economists have said, there may be some merit -- there may be merit in some of the proposals that the Republicans have put forward either from the House or the McCain-Paul proposal.\xc2\xa0 But there is no doubt, no question, that they do not address the urgent need for near-term economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the proposals that you just ticked through, would those have the most measurable impact on job creation over the next 12 to 18 months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would urge you to ask economists about that, including outside analysts who have looked at this.\xc2\xa0 But the whole package is put together with the need for urgent, early action in mind.\xc2\xa0 And economists will tell you that the payroll tax cut has that effect for individuals, that the employer-side payroll tax cut for small businesses has that.\xc2\xa0 Direct assistance to state and localities that directly and literally put people -- teachers, educators, firefighters, policemen and women back to work has that impact.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these are all provisions that do that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know which is better than the other.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re all very effective.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did say in the Saturday radio address, and I think Josh also said yesterday in the briefing, in the teleconference, that they were going first for the aid to states and local governments for protecting teachers\xe2\x80\x99 jobs and the like. Is that the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- gets the award for actually paying attention to the things that we say, including what the President says.\xc2\xa0 So that is our expectation that the first measure will be teachers, yes.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of Senator Reid.\xc2\xa0 But, again, it is up to Senator Reid, and I want to make that clear.\xc2\xa0 We have been in consultation with him, but it\xe2\x80\x99s his prerogative and we\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased that he will be taking it up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they are taking -- so that\xe2\x80\x99s what Senator Reid wants to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our understanding is that teachers would be the first -- the aid to states and localities -- which is teachers and first responders.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So like $35 million, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the figures here.\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnybody else?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will members of Congress be traveling with the President today whose district he\xe2\x80\x99s going to?\xc2\xa0 And were they invited?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to look into the -- get answers to you on both those questions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How explicitly do you expect the President to embrace or echo some of the rhetoric of the Occupy Wall Street protest?\xc2\xa0 We heard Josh yesterday actually use the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cthe 99 percent of Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Might we expect to see the President move in that direction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want you to listen carefully to what the President does say, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t preview his remarks in any detail.\xc2\xa0 But I think we have expressed, and the President has expressed, an understanding of the frustration that the demonstrations manifest and represent.\xc2\xa0 There is a link between two things:\xc2\xa0 One, the frustrations that regular folks -- middle-class Americans feel about the state of the economy, the need for growth to improve, and certainly the need for job creation to improve.\xc2\xa0 And there is a related frustration that a lot of Americans feel about the idea that Wall Street in the past played by different rules than Main Street*, and now we have a situation where -- and yet was, for good reasons, was assisted by the federal government to prevent the financial sector from collapsing.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing on that, there is frustration now I believe with the efforts by some to roll back the protections the President fought so hard to put into place through the Wall Street reform act that was passed and signed into law.\xc2\xa0 It is -- I don\'t have to imply or insinuate that it is the objective of the Republicans, including contenders for president, to roll back those reforms because they say so themselves.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just inconceivable to us that an economic plan for the future would contain within it the elimination of reforms that would prevent the kind of financial protector collapse that we saw that created the greatest recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 Just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to us.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President use that anger against Wall Street to kind of leverage his jobs bill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on passing his jobs plan.\xc2\xa0 What has been true since the first day we announced it and has been true every time we\'ve talked about it, and is true when I\'m asked and others are asked about why he\'s going out into the country to sell his jobs plan, is that it matters what he says, but it matters even more what the American people are saying -- the constituents to the senators and congressmen are saying about what their priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And we feel very strongly that the priorities are an insistence that\'s independent and bipartisan that Washington needs to act, needs to do something positive for the economy, positive for job creation.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe do not believe that there is a broad consensus among the American public that we need to roll back Wall Street reforms and we need to adopt the kind of economic policies that led to the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 We\'re pretty confident about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:27 A.M.
