PRICE:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining today\xe2\x80\x99s call.\xc2\xa0 We wanted to offer an opportunity to speak to you about next week\xe2\x80\x99s U.S.-ASEAN summit at Sunnylands.\xc2\xa0 First, a bit on attribution for this call -- this will be on the record.\xc2\xa0 We have two senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 The first is Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is also joined by Dan Kritenbrink, the National Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s Senior Director for Asian Affairs.\xc2\xa0 This call will be on the record, but it will be embargoed until the end of the call, so we would ask that you not use any material from this call until it concludes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Ben and go from there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go through the schedule, and then some of the key objectives of the summit in Sunnylands, and then see if Dan has anything to add, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just first on the schedule, the summit events begin on Monday afternoon, February 15th.\xc2\xa0 The President will be greeting each of the leaders as they arrive at the summit, and then they will go into the first working session, which will focus on the economy, specifically promoting regional prosperity through innovation and entrepreneurship.\xc2\xa0 Then, that evening, the leaders will have a working dinner at Sunnylands.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The next morning, they will have another plenary session, this one focused on security issues, specifically protecting peace, prosperity, and security in the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And then at the conclusion of that session, there will be a family photo with the different leaders, and then the President will hold a press conference.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the summit itself and the objectives -- oh, and let me just add, before I go into that, that the President will be joined at the summit by Secretary Kerry, Secretary Pritzker, and Ambassador Froman, our trade representative.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that speaks to the breadth of our government-to-government engagement with the different ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 We also expect there to be business leaders who will be able to join the summit and participate in some of the economic discussions on the first day -- again, given the interest that the U.S. business community has in ASEAN and the important of ASEAN to the future of the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a truly unique and historic occurrence with the President hosting these leaders in a standalone U.S.-ASEAN Summit here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s central to the President\xe2\x80\x99s broader strategy of rebalancing to the Asia Pacific region, which he has pursued since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we took office, our belief was that the U.S. was underweighted in the Asia Pacific, and that was represented in the way in which we were engaging with the different regional institutions and the regional architecture.\xc2\xa0 Now, ASEAN is of enormous interest to the United States.\xc2\xa0 The 10 ASEAN nations together represent the world\xe2\x80\x99s seventh largest economy.\xc2\xa0 They are at the nexus of critical security issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s maritime security, counterterrorism, or counter-piracy.\xc2\xa0 And their efforts are essential to combatting the threat of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And important, though, we also saw ASEAN as central to our efforts to engage the Asia Pacific architecture.\xc2\xa0 Our alliances with our traditional allies in the Asia-Pacific are the cornerstone of our engagement in the region, but we see ASEAN as the hub of the regional architecture that is emerging.\xc2\xa0 We engage at the head-of-state level through APEC on economic and commercial issues.\xc2\xa0 But increasingly through this administration, we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged with ASEAN and with the East Asia Summit to address economic and political and security issues, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want to make very clear that the United States is going to be at the table and a part of setting the agenda in the Asia Pacific in the decades to come.\xc2\xa0 In order to do that, we need to be engaging organizations like ASEAN at the highest levels.\xc2\xa0 And so this summit is meant to send a signal going forward that the U.S. values ASEAN, that we are going to be engaged in Southeast Asia, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be engaged in working with the nations of the Asia Pacific to set clear rules of the road on the various issues of common interest that we share with them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of those, of course, is economic issues in trade and investment.\xc2\xa0 And collectively, ASEAN represents America\xe2\x80\x99s fourth largest trading partner, and our exports to ASEAN support hundreds of thousands of jobs and we are the largest source of foreign direct investment in ASEAN.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Importantly of note, we have several TPP countries in ASEAN to include Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia, and we also see interest in TPP from other members of ASEAN, as well.\xc2\xa0 So this is a region that the President has prioritized in his economic engagement because it\xe2\x80\x99s a growing market that is going to be central to driving American growth and job creation going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ASEAN has been working to integrate their own economies through the ASEAN community, and that creates new opportunities for us to engage the collective of ASEAN in deepening our trade and commercial ties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course there are a number of critical security issues that will be discussed.\xc2\xa0 One of those is maritime security, including the situation in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 And so this will be an opportunity for the leaders to discuss some of the recent events that have taken place in the South China Sea, including the test flights at the newly constructed runway in Fiery Cross Reef.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. will be underscoring the importance of resolving any territorial disputes consistent with international norms and international law, and we will continue to underscore the principle that these issues have to be resolved consistent with international norms and not through bigger nations bullying smaller ones.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there will be a discussion around maritime security.\xc2\xa0 There will also be a discussion around counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 The recent attack in Jakarta highlights the efforts that ISIL and other extremist groups have made to try to establish a foothold in the region.\xc2\xa0 We work in partnership with ASEAN countries on issues related to counterterrorism and law enforcement cooperation and countering violent extremism, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to have the dialogue about the emerging security picture in the region as it relates to the threat of terrorism.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, we have spent a lot of time working with ASEAN countries on issues involving energy and the environment. \xc2\xa0And the successful agreement in Paris depended in part on our ability to work closely with ASEAN countries as they pursue their own individual climate targets and more environmentally sustainable models of the economic development.\xc2\xa0 So that will continue to be a focus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, there are varying degrees of democratic governance in the different ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S., of course, supports universal values related to freedom of expression, freedom of speech, the ability of civil society to organize and be productive in different countries.\xc2\xa0 So, of course, the President will be lifting up the need for good governance, the rule of law, accountable institutions, and not just in ASEAN but around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some good progress in some ASEAN countries in recent years.\xc2\xa0 Burma is in the midst of an historic transition to an NLD-led government with a new parliament that has recently been seated, and the selection of a president in the coming weeks.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re always mindful of the need to make continued progress in supporting the rights of civil society and those seeking to exercise their universal values.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, I\xe2\x80\x99d just note that we\xe2\x80\x99ve expanded significantly our people-to-people engagement with Southeast Asia.\xc2\xa0 The President has initiated the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative that has captured significant energy across the region.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for ways to continue to enhance our people-to-people engagement, our focus on young people, and ways in which we can take these increasing ties between our governments and our business communities, but also see similar growth in the ties between our peoples.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if Dan -- if you have anything to add, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. KRITENBRINK:\xc2\xa0 That was fantastic, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I would just add this is a tremendous opportunity for us to highlight, I think, the breadth and depth of our new strategic partnership with ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m excited for the discussions that our leaders will be able to have and our ability, again, to shine a bright light on the tremendous cooperation that we have and that we hope to continue going forward with this part of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, and thanks for making yourselves available.\xc2\xa0 Ben, I think you might have covered some of this, but I was very interested in how the idea for the summit came about, why the President thought it was important to host the ASEAN leaders in the U.S. for a meeting like this.\xc2\xa0 And is this something that he is hoping that his successor will continue in the years to come?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, so -- look, the President made this shift early in the administration to begin to engage the ASEAN Summit in Asia at the head-of-state level and to do that on an annual basis.\xc2\xa0 And what that did is that put us at the table with ASEAN in a way that evolved into the strategic partnership we announced last year.\xc2\xa0 It also put us at the table in the East Asia Summit process, which is only a recent innovation in the Asia-Pacific architecture, but which brings together ASEAN countries, but also countries like China, the United States, India, Russia, Japan, Australia, and others.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason that\'s so important is the Asia-Pacific is the largest emerging market in the world.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a place where there are many different security challenges that bear directly on our interests.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, it doesn\'t have the same type of evolved institutions and arrangements that our transatlantic community has, that we have with Europe.\xc2\xa0 And so really this architecture for how problems are going to be solved in the Asia Pacific is still evolving.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by engaging at the head-of-state level with ASEAN, we\'re able to be at the table in shaping that architecture.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, what happens when leaders come together every year is essentially that develops a work plan that governments follow where we\'re deepening our cooperation in all of these different areas.\xc2\xa0 So how are we developing better counterterrorism cooperation?\xc2\xa0 How are we aligning our positions as it relates to critical security challenges in the region?\xc2\xa0 How are we working together to fight the shared threat of climate change?\xc2\xa0 And importantly, how are we opening the markets and overcoming barriers to trade and investment in ways that serve all of our interests?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s been the guiding principle for why we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged at this level.\xc2\xa0 As we looked to the last year and the things that the President wanted to do, I think he wanted to send a signal that Southeast Asia has to be a key priority for the United States going forward, and that by bringing all of these leaders here to the United States, to Sunnylands, we could both finalize what we want to get done in this last year in office, but also send the message going forward that we do believe there should be this level of engagement with Southeast Asia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think he sent a similar message when he hosted all of the African leaders here at a head-of-state level for the first time in the United States, and went to the African Union last year.\xc2\xa0 These are emerging regions that are going to matter more to us.\xc2\xa0 And part of what he\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to do in our foreign policy is demonstrate that we need to have a truly global focus.\xc2\xa0 And that means engaging at the top level with these countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what guided his focus, and we do believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that that is a message that is carried forward under future administrations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the key way that that will take place is by going the ASEAN summits that are in Asia.\xc2\xa0 This is a unique occurrence to host people here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d note that this begins a year of very sustained engagement in the Asia-Pacific.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have two trips to Asia that we\'re already aware of -- one anchored around the G7 meeting in Japan in May, and then another with the summits -- the G20 in China and the ASEAN meeting in Laos in September.\xc2\xa0 So this will kick off, I think, a year of significant attention on the Asia-Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just the very last thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say is some of the key priorities we\'re trying to get done this year bear very much on this region.\xc2\xa0 We want to get TPP approved.\xc2\xa0 That involves a number of these countries.\xc2\xa0 We want to have a truly global coalition against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 That involves a number of these countries.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to leave the United States in a stronger position in the Asia-Pacific, and that certainly involves all of them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is, you have a very diverse set of countries here, some very large economies and population; others much smaller.\xc2\xa0 Some are more democracies or heading toward some sort of representative democracy; others are not.\xc2\xa0 And some are very wealthy and others are very much developing.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about ASEAN as a big bloc, but they all have sort of different levels of development?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get a sense of how you can engage them in a group like this, but recognize that they\xe2\x80\x99re at different stages and send maybe nuanced messages to each one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a really good question. Let me just start, and then Dan will certainly want to get in.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re certainly right -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a huge diversity of size, development, democracy across ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 One point I\xe2\x80\x99d make is that ASEAN has worked over the last several years to try to develop more of a collective identity and develop what they call an ASEAN community.\xc2\xa0 And that is useful for us because it allows us to engage the collective.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about trade and investment issues, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about maritime security issues, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about issues around energy cooperation, it\xe2\x80\x99s a way of engaging all 10 countries at once.\xc2\xa0 And so the more that they are working to integrate the ASEAN community, the easier it is for us to engage across a diverse set of countries.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged ASEAN integration.\xc2\xa0 That makes it easier for us to harmonize a discussion on these various issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just point to two things underneath that.\xc2\xa0 One is, on democracy, which you mentioned, it is absolutely the case that you see a variance of where countries are.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, I think countries can look to one another to see how the process of democratization moves forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Indonesia has undergone a democratic transition over the last two decades, from military rule to a civilian, democratically elected government.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve wrestled with difficult challenges -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve wrestled with insurgencies, different types of violence -- but they\xe2\x80\x99ve I think stuck to an impressive democratic transition.\xc2\xa0 You have a country like Burma that is wrestling with some of those same issues as they move from a military-led government to a civilian-elected government, as they deal with the national reconciliation process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These issues are not exactly the same in different countries, but the point is there are elements that can be drawn from different countries as they wrestle with similar challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on an issue like maritime security, you have a circumstance in the South China Sea, for instance, where you have a number of these countries in ASEAN that are claimants and some that aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made is that the U.S. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take a particular position with respect to claims, but what everybody should be able to agree upon is that, one, it is better to avoid inadvertent and unnecessary escalation with respect to military action or militarization in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 That should be a common interest.\xc2\xa0 Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a claimant or not a claimant, you want to see stability.\xc2\xa0 You also want to see principles upheld, like freedom of navigation, that benefit everybody -- because people depend on open sea lanes, and people depend upon predictable commerce.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve underscored that our actions in the South China Sea are about upholding principles like freedom of navigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then lastly, everybody has an interest in the peaceful resolution of disputes consistent with international law.\xc2\xa0 Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a claimant or not -- that that principle is something that we all benefit from.\xc2\xa0 So our ability to have that discussion with ASEAN as a whole is important and, frankly, a more effective form of dialogue than just going individual claimant to individual claimant, because we think that these are a shared set of interests.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. KRITENBRINK:\xc2\xa0 Ben, I would just underscore what you said by making a couple of additional points.\xc2\xa0 I think given the diversity in ASEAN, we think one effective way going forward is focus on the general principles that I think should guide all of us going forward.\xc2\xa0 For example, in the economic and trade sessions, we want to use innovation and entrepreneurship as a vehicle for talking about the effective policy changes that every country can and should make, no matter their size -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s protecting intellectual property or having an open and transparent investment system and the like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, I would say that all countries of ASEAN, together with the United States, we face a number of shared challenges, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s climate, countering violent extremism, or global health.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, I think one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s primary emphases in the region has been on building a rules-based order whereby every country, whether large or small, plays by the same rules -- and that gives us our best opportunity for maintaining peace and stability going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd my final point would be -- of course, during this summit and nearly 24 hours on the ground, we anticipate the President will have many opportunities for pull-asides with individual leaders, and in those opportunities he can pass tailored messages to individual leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, thanks so much for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 At the end of last month, the U.S. hit another FONOP operation in the South China Sea, which a lot of ASEAN countries have welcomed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can give us -- or if President Obama at the summit will give ASEAN leaders a sense of how frequently they can expect that from the U.S.\xc2\xa0 And conversely, is there -- other than settling various claimant disputes through international tribunals, is there more that the U.S. would like to see ASEAN countries doing to combat the Chinese monopoly in the South China Sea?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will give the other leaders a very direct sense of his thinking as he approaches the issues in the South China Sea, including the issue of how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to promote the principle of freedom of navigation, how we think about our presence in the region, and the partnerships that we have with different militaries in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked to develop not just strong ties with our allies -- and we had a recent step forward with the Philippines in the approval of our access agreement -- but also how we\xe2\x80\x99re working cooperatively with different militaries on upholding important principles, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on maritime security or counter-piracy and other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the message with respect to ASEAN and China, again, our point is not to privilege one claim over another, but rather to work with ASEAN to try to find ways to ensure that collectively they\xe2\x80\x99re working to support international principles to resolve disputes consistent with international law and to avoid efforts to resolve those disputes through one bigger nation bullying a smaller one.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been our guiding set of principles.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an ability to discuss the current environment, acknowledge some of the recent tensions, and try to chart a way forward that instills confidence that we are going to be a source of stability and fair and peaceful resolution of these disputes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. KRITENBRINK:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, the President will emphasize that our focus is promoting and sustaining a rules-based order, and that includes -- that applies to the maritime domain, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And specifically, we\xe2\x80\x99d like all countries to recognize the importance of freedom of navigation or freedom of overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, and the use of international law to resolve those disputes.\xc2\xa0 And more specifically, I anticipate that the President will continue to call on claimants to halt land reclamation, construction of new facilities, and to carry out no militarization of outposts in the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 So I think those will be other messages that the President will promote.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could I make just one comment on China, as well.\xc2\xa0 Just to emphasize again, this is the summit about the United States and our increasingly broad and deep relationship with ASEAN.\xc2\xa0 Some of these relations will -- some of these issues that will be discussed will have some relation with China.\xc2\xa0 But again, the focus is on our relationship with ASEAN.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I also anticipate the President will make clear, as he often does, we are committed to building the most constructive, productive relationship with China possible whereby we maximize cooperation and constructively manage differences.\xc2\xa0 And we would expect our friends in ASEAN to do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing the call.\xc2\xa0 I have another South China Sea question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you expect there to be a joint statement on the South China Sea at the end of the summit.\xc2\xa0 And how you respond to some of the ideas that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that China is pressuring some of non-claimant countries like Cambodia and Laos and Thailand, since they don\'t have claims, to not sign on to whatever statement the U.S. and the rest of the countries, specifically the claimant countries, want to put out on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the issue with North Korea is going to come up and whether or not your efforts to get China to work with you on North Korea could make it more difficult for you to have a strong statement on what they\'re doing in the South China Sea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. KRITENBRINK:\xc2\xa0 Could I provide an initial response?\xc2\xa0 I would say that I don\'t want to preview what kind of statements may or may not come out of the summit.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is, as Ben previewed, maritime issues will be one of several topics to be addressed at the summit.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important one.\xc2\xa0 And I think our focus will remain I think the common unifying principles that many of us adhere to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We were quite encouraged last November at the East Asia Summit in which the discussion in the room revealed that there is actually great consensus in the region behind these broader principles, like supporting freedom of navigation, freedom of overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, and basing claims in international law.\xc2\xa0 So I expect that will be the focus of the conversation here at Sunnylands, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of North Korea, I think we made very clear our position on North Korea over the last few days.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve condemned the latest provocation that\xe2\x80\x99s been carried out by North Korea.\xc2\xa0 We have reassured our allies in the region, beginning with South Korea and Japan, of our ironclad security commitments to them.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we will take a number of steps, including in New York at the U.N., to demonstrate to North Korea that there are consequences for its actions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 China is an important partner in that effort and will remain so going forward.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last week, the President has spoken with President Xi Jinping on the phone about how to address the North Korean threat, and he did the same last night with the leaders of the ROK and Japan, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate, given the importance of this issue, it will also be addressed at Sunnylands.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d just add on the first question, again, our view is that this should not be a matter where these principles matter to claimants but they don\xe2\x80\x99t matter to non-claimants.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, everybody has an interest in freedom of navigation and open sea lanes and the avoidance of conflict and militarization, and in international law and a rules-based order in the Asia-Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario in which everybody benefits.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard time and again from our ASEAN partners, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re claimants or not, is that type of stable, rules-based order is what creates the environment for continued economic development and continued development of our political and diplomatic relations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, that involves the U.S. having a constructive relationship with China, as well; that these not be seen as zero-sum issues, but rather issues where we have a set of common principles.\xc2\xa0 And this summit will be an opportunity to reinforce that so that it\xe2\x80\x99s not simply a matter of these principles are of interest to claimants but not to non-claimants.\xc2\xa0 I think this matter is to everyone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 One is, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the response to the latest provocation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also worked with some of these countries over many years to address a range of security challenges related to North Korea.\xc2\xa0 For instance, proliferation concerns, work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with different countries through our counter-proliferation efforts to ensure that North Korea is not able to export materiel that could serve a proliferation purpose.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had good cooperation on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of these countries have reduced their relations with North Korea, their military-to-military cooperation.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had some good progress with ASEAN countries on that set of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And frankly, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen good engagement in these multilateral settings on these issues related to nonproliferation.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned before, the East Asia Summit has been a venue for our ally, the Republic of Korea, to also engage ASEAN, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the time.\xc2\xa0 Since I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk to you guys very often, I got lost.\xc2\xa0 And, Dan and Ben, actually, if you could just tell me who answered AP\xe2\x80\x99s first question.\xc2\xa0 Was it Dan or Ben?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That was Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, for AP, the first question.\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 My question is, aside from the focus of the summit, what other plans -- we\xe2\x80\x99re a local paper in Palm Springs -- what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans for any side trips such as touring some desert areas that he can designate as national monuments under the Antiquities Act, or visiting Twentynine Palms.\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to any other side trips that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of my White House colleagues.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have more detailed information about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule over the time that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be out there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just be able to speak to the national security side of things.\xc2\xa0 So you should anticipate getting more information from the White House Press Office on that in the coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only thing I\xe2\x80\x99d just say of interest for your readership is that the President has really come to enjoy Sunnylands as a good venue to have these types of open discussions with leaders.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a more relaxed and informal setting than having a summit here in our government offices.\xc2\xa0 He was able to have good discussions with Xi Jinping and King Abdullah at Sunnylands.\xc2\xa0 And so it lends itself to kind of a stepped-back, broader strategic set of discussions in a very peaceful setting in which the leaders can get to know one another and really try to dig in over an extended period of time in a way that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t in an one-hour meeting here at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s been back there now several times in the last few years, and he\xe2\x80\x99s appreciated the ability to take his fellow leaders out of the bubble, as it were, of Washington, and to have a more free-flowing discussion in a fairly peaceful but spectacular setting in California.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi there.\xc2\xa0 Well, I hate to use that word \xe2\x80\x9cdeliverables,\xe2\x80\x9d but are there any specific agreements or anything you would like to see or expect to see coming out of this meeting, maybe along the lines of the coalition against ISIS or something like that?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So obviously we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 I think what this mainly is, is an opportunity to set the work plan, essentially, for the U.S. and ASEAN going forward.\xc2\xa0 So we will be looking for specific ways in which we can increase our trade and commercial relationship, particularly in these areas around innovation.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for ways to cooperate with those countries that are concerned about ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to gain a foothold in the region.\xc2\xa0 That obviously varies among different countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking, as I said, to increase our people-to-people ties.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to develop a common set of principles for how we respond to a whole host of issues, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s maritime security that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed at length or the other challenges confronting the U.S. and ASEAN.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think there will be, in different areas, a different set of plans, a different set of details, depending on what the issue is.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide you with updates on that over the course of the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to -- sorry, it\xe2\x80\x99s loud here (inaudible) in New Hampshire.\xc2\xa0 But I wanted to follow up Toluse\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, China is a big undercurrent at this summit.\xc2\xa0 The site itself is where President Obama met President Xi.\xc2\xa0 And you guys were having some North Korea discussions, and there\xe2\x80\x99s been rumors of contention between the U.S. and China on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And so can you more specifically address whether or not there will be anything about this summit that is calibrated because of those discussions?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sounds like you\'re going to have an entertaining evening there in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say that -- look, the fact of the matter is, over the course of the last seven years, this is kind of central to our entire approach to our Asia Pacific policy, which is that we have been able to focus on our core alliances, develop relations with these emerging powers in Southeast Asia, and have a very productive U.S.-China relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And at any given time in the U.S.-China relationship, there are going to be areas where we cooperate, and there are going to be areas where we have differences.\xc2\xa0 And so for instance, we would not have been able to achieve some of the most significant breakthroughs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in our foreign policy absent cooperation with China.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the Paris climate agreement, or if you look at the Iran nuclear deal, both of those involved significant cooperation from China.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had strong differences with China on a range of issues -- again, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on cyber or differences with respect to actions in the South China Sea, for instance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But our whole point is that the relationship with China is big enough that we can have a difference on one issue and try to find ways to cooperate on another.\xc2\xa0 And we don\'t allow for there to be the type of spillover in which we are unable to work together on something because we have a difference on a separate issue.\xc2\xa0 So to be very specific, we share an interest in denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 China does not benefit from the types of provocations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from North Korea in the recent weeks.\xc2\xa0 And so we approach China on the basis that we have a shared interest in the principle of denuclearization and the avoiding of escalation on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it is always going to be the U.S. position that we uphold principles like freedom of navigation, that we support the peaceful resolution of disputes consistent with international law.\xc2\xa0 And so the important principle here is that the Chinese know where we\'re coming from, and that we\'re very clear and transparent with them, that we continue to preserve the areas where we can and must cooperate, and that if we have differences, we\'re candid with one another.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s guided our whole relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, if you look at the ASEAN countries, they very much value the U.S. and China having a productive relationship.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t want to see the U.S. and China in conflict.\xc2\xa0 Even where some of them may have differences with China, I think they support our efforts to have open dialogue, to have our own military-to-military relationship with China, and to try to preserve that constructive cooperation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, even as we deal with very sensitive issues and territorial disputes and these issues around maritime security, our positions are well known to China.\xc2\xa0 The President was able to share them directly with Xi Jinping in their discussions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, our shared interest in dealing with these provocations from North Korea will remain the same.\xc2\xa0 So again, we will not be trimming our sails on any of these issues.\xc2\xa0 On the contrary, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making clear that our role in the Asia Pacific -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on maritime security or nonproliferation -- is to uphold international rules and international norms.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the countries of the region look to us for, and that\'s what will be our approach here at ASEAN.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, thanks, everybody, for joining the call.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep in touch through the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 6:20 P.M.
