EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes lead us off here for about 10, 15 minutes, take your foreign policy/national security-focused questions.\xc2\xa0 And then I will pull up the rear.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everyone.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll just get to it.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I wondered if could comment on two recent international developments.\xc2\xa0 One is, NATO says that Russian artillery has moved into Ukraine and is firing on government positions.\xc2\xa0 And the other one is this Chinese jet intercept of a Navy plane in international waters.\xc2\xa0 And if I could follow up later on Islamic State.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, with respect to the Chinese jet, I know the Pentagon spoke to this earlier today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a deeply concerning provocation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated directly to the Chinese government our objection to this type of action.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the additional details, I think the Pentagon spoke to those.\xc2\xa0 But again, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged is constructive military-to-military ties with China, and this type of action clearly violates the spirit of that engagement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made our concerns known directly to Beijing.</p>\n<p>With respect to the developments in Ukraine, we very much condemn the violation -- flagrant violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty that we saw today with the movement of this Russian convoy into Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 There had been negotiations during which it was made clear that Ukraine would have to accept the delivery of any humanitarian convoy into the country.\xc2\xa0 It was made clear that the ICRC would have to participate in the delivery of any humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 That has not taken place.\xc2\xa0 The ICRC is not part of this delivery.\xc2\xa0 The government of Ukraine did not give agreement for this convoy to move within their borders.</p>\n<p>I think this is part of a pattern that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent weeks and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted of Russian support to armed separatists in eastern Ukraine that violates Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and destabilizes the situation.\xc2\xa0 So we are deeply concerned about this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in touch with the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 We will be in touch today with our partners at the U.N. Security Council to discuss next steps.\xc2\xa0 Russia should take the opportunity to remove this convoy from within Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they will face additional costs and consequences from the United States and our partners in the international community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that apparently NATO is saying that there are Russian artillery in Ukraine as well?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have seen the use of Russian artillery in Ukraine in the past days.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak to an individual instance today.\xc2\xa0 But it certainly has been a pattern whereby we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen firing from within Russia into Ukraine, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a disturbing movement of Russian artillery and military equipment into Ukraine as well.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d say that this takes place in the context of the separatists dramatically losing support within eastern Ukraine, and the Ukrainian military making gains in places like Luhansk and Donetsk.\xc2\xa0 The way, however, to respond to that situation and the humanitarian needs, the legitimate humanitarian needs, in eastern Ukraine is to pursue a path of de-escalation, not to move forward with further violations of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity, which has only alienated Russia from the people of eastern Ukraine and isolated Russia in the international community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Islamic State, yesterday General Dempsey said that Islamic State can only be defeated if the fight is taken to them in Syria.\xc2\xa0 I wondered, is that -- does the President agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how does he intend to undertake it?\xc2\xa0 And would it mean a significant change in the mission against Islamic State?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly agree that any strategy to deal with the ISIL organization has to deal with both sides of the border, Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 The strategy that we are already undertaking does address that in the sense that we are providing training and equipping and assistance to the Iraqi security forces and Kurdish security forces who are fighting them on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We are also providing support and military assistance to the moderate Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 What we would like to see is those efforts squeeze the space where ISIL operates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there are other elements to our strategy.\xc2\xa0 One is to enlist the support of partners in the region and the international community, because this poses a significant threat not just to the United States and to the Iraqi and Syrian people, but to the entire region.\xc2\xa0 And there are things that we can do with partners to mobilize communities in places like Iraq to work to expel ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of U.S. military action.\xc2\xa0 And the President has already authorized U.S. military action on the very specific missions of protecting our people and personnel and our facilities in Baghdad and Erbil.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also authorized military action to deal with the humanitarian crisis on Mount Sinjar.\xc2\xa0 Again, as we look ahead and look forward, we are going to do what is necessary to protect Americans.\xc2\xa0 And so if we see plotting against Americans, we see a threat to the United States emanating from anywhere, we stand ready to take action against that threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve made very clear time and again that if you come after Americans, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to come after you wherever you are.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to guide our planning in the days to come.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President signed off on airstrikes against ISIL in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of decisions the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been presented with, specific military options outside of those carrying out the current missions in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But we would certainly look at what is necessary in the long term to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting Americans.\xc2\xa0 Again, the long-term strategy is going to have to involve people on the ground taking the fight to ISIL, and that is Iraqi and Kurdish forces; that is Syrians who we are supporting on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But if we have a need to protect Americans and to take action when we see plotting against the United States and our interests, we\xe2\x80\x99ll reserve the right to do so.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of those decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say you\xe2\x80\x99re actively considering airstrikes against ISIL targets in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you heard the President say we will be relentless against ISIL, and we will do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to protect Americans and see that justice is done for what we saw with the barbaric killing of Jim Foley.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re actively considering what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be restricted by borders.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve shown time and again that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a counterterrorism threat we\xe2\x80\x99ll take direct action against that threat if necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing -- on Ukraine, the Russian convoy, do you see that as a direct invasion of Ukraine?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, again, we see this as part of a pattern of a flagrant violation of Ukrainian sovereignty; a direct incursion into their territory.\xc2\xa0 They continue to have masses of military forces on the border, too, that would be a further escalation were they to move into Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re giving the Russians a clear message that they need to remove this convoy from inside of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s borders.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, we will be making determinations with our international partners about how to ratchet up the costs and consequences on them.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, again, this is not something that has started today.\xc2\xa0 From the arming and training of Russia-backed separatists, to the shoot-down of MH17, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen escalation.\xc2\xa0 And this adds to that escalation in a dangerous way.\xc2\xa0 The Russians should take a path to de-escalation.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they\xe2\x80\x99re just going to find themselves further isolated, not just from the people of eastern Ukraine, but from the entire world.</p>\n<p>Yes, Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From the way the administration, including yourself, is talking about ISIS today, it seems like a big jump from what the President himself said in January, calling ISIS a JV player.\xc2\xa0 So would you still agree with his assessment just a few months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President was speaking to a few months ago was, the fact of the matter is you have many different groups operating across the Middle East and North Africa.\xc2\xa0 As we shift from a situation in which the counterterrorism threat, principally emanating from al Qaeda core, we are going to need to evaluate which of these groups pose a threat to the United States, which of these groups pose a threat to our personnel in the region, and which of these groups are more localized, militia-type forces that are potentially dangerous but can be handled by local security forces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Clearly, ISIL, which has a long history and an origin dating back to AQI, al Qaeda in Iraq, has gained capacity in the last several months as the fighting in Syria has given them some safe haven there, and as they\xe2\x80\x99ve advanced across Iraq and gained heavy weaponry, and as they\xe2\x80\x99ve become better funded through various funding streams, including what they\xe2\x80\x99re able to sell in terms of oil and gas, the ransoms that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to obtain.\xc2\xa0 And that has developed their capacity in a way that has increased the threat.\xc2\xa0 And they pose a greater threat today than they did six months ago, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 That includes the direct military action we\xe2\x80\x99re taking in Iraq; that includes the increased support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided to the Iraqi and Kurdish forces and to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to deal with this counterterrorism challenge.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Former CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell said of James Foley\xe2\x80\x99s death, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is ISIS\xe2\x80\x99s first terrorist attack against the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment?\xc2\xa0 Was that a terrorist attack against the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, absolutely when you see somebody killed in such a horrific way that represents a terrorist attack; that represents a terrorist attack against our country and against an American citizen.\xc2\xa0 And I think all of us have the Foley family in our thoughts and prayers.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen ISIL seek to advance too close to our facilities certainly for our own comfort.\xc2\xa0 And so the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take military action a number of weeks ago was out of direct concern that if they were able to get into Erbil, that they could pose a threat to our personnel and our consulate there.\xc2\xa0 So we have seen them pose a threat to our interests in the region, to our personnel and facilities in the region.\xc2\xa0 And clearly, the brutal execution of Jim Foley represented an affront, an attack not just on him, but he is an American, and we see that as an attack on our country when one of our own is killed like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how would you assess the threat that they pose to Americans living in the United States?\xc2\xa0 Do you take their threats seriously?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kristen, we have to take their threats seriously.\xc2\xa0 To date, they have operated much like an insurgency in Syria and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And again, they\'re deeply rooted in the insurgency that we faced in Iraq for many years as the legacy organization of al Qaeda in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And they, of course, pose a huge threat to the people in that region.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to underscore, as the President did the other day, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not simply the threat they pose to the United States; it\xe2\x80\x99s the threat that they pose to the entire world.</p>\n<p>And they\xe2\x80\x99ve killed thousands of civilians, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve killed Muslims more than any other faith.\xc2\xa0 So whatever pretense they have to establish themselves as speaking for the Muslim world I think is completely disproven by their actions in that part of the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>For Americans in the homeland, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99d say is we monitor very closely whether or not ISIL will seek to develop plots that are aimed at the West, aimed at beyond this geographic area where they\xe2\x80\x99ve been operating.\xc2\xa0 We are doing that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re actively consulting with European partners about how to watch the threat that they could pose to the West.\xc2\xa0 We take their threats seriously, because we have to take every threat that\'s made against the United States seriously.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with that through, again, the action and the strategy we have in the region to squeeze them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re also dealing with it through homeland security.\xc2\xa0 And the President is going to convene at the head-of-state level a U.N. Security Council meeting in September to deal with the issue of foreign fighters who are heading to Syria, because we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the ability of foreign fighters to come from Western countries and seek to come back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could they pull off a 9/11-size attack?\xc2\xa0 Are they capable of that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, to date, we have not seen them focus on that type of planning.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\'t mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be very mindful that they could quickly aim to pivot to attacks against Western targets outside of the region.\xc2\xa0 And so, again, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99re going to monitor very closely, because we certainly take seriously the fact that this is an organization that has a cadre of fighters who are clearly willing to do horrific things, as we saw in that video and as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen as they massacre innocent civilians in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They have a significant stream of funding that they\xe2\x80\x99ve acquired over the last year or two.\xc2\xa0 And again, if they show the intent, or they show plotting against the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be prepared to deal with that as necessary.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, the bigger picture on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States now engaged in a broad counterterrorism effort to defeat ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The Iraqi government is certainly at the front of an effort to defeat ISIL inside of Iraq, and we\xe2\x80\x99re providing them with support in order to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think the strategy is one that we want to evict ISIL from their safe havens and squeeze the space that they\'re operating in, and ultimately push them out of that space.</p>\n<p>Our contribution to that will come in many ways.\xc2\xa0 It comes in the form of the airstrikes that are protecting Baghdad and Erbil that have given space for Iraqi forces to push forward against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It comes in the form of military assistance and advice and intelligence-sharing that we have with Iraqi and Kurdish forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 It comes with our political support in service of a new and inclusive Iraqi government, which should be able to broaden the coalition against ISIL so that we see more of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors working with, for instance, Sunni communities to evict ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So this is going to have to be a team effort.</p>\n<p>But we have very unique capabilities that we can bring to bear in supporting those on the ground who are working to fight against ISIL on the frontlines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just a basic question:\xc2\xa0 Is it the objective of U.S. efforts here to defeat ISIL?\xc2\xa0 Is that a U.S. objective -- to defeat this terrorist --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, in the long term our objective would be to see an organization like ISIL defeated.\xc2\xa0 Our military objectives -- and so I\xe2\x80\x99m just separating out the fact that we have military objectives that the President has articulated that aim to protect our facilities in Iraq and prevent this humanitarian catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 In that long-term strategy of working for the defeat of ISIL, we will participate not just through our military actions, but through our training and equipping of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish security forces on the ground -- because ultimately they are the ones who are going to have to work to evict ISIL from their communities.</p>\n<p>And again, their efforts to form an inclusive government in Iraq I think will go a long way towards enlisting the support of those communities who have been somewhat disaffected from the government in recent years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get you to respond to Michael Foley, Jim Foley\xe2\x80\x99s brother, pretty emotional comments.\xc2\xa0 He said -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States could have done more on behalf of the Western and American hostages over there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, our hearts go out to Mr. Foley and the entire Foley family.\xc2\xa0 I cannot imagine how it must feel to lose a loved one, and to lose a loved one in such a horrible way.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly understand that any family would want to make sure that we are moving heaven and Earth to find and bring home American hostages.</p>\n<p>I can assure you that we have done everything that we can possibly do to try to bring home our hostages.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly difficult circumstance in a place like Syria, again, where you have such a violent conflict raging.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve used all of our military, intelligence, diplomatic resources that we can bring to bear to try to pull a thread to find out where our hostages are; to try to rescue them when we saw an opportunity; to try to work with any country that might have any means of locating them.\xc2\xa0 And tragically, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to rescue Mr. Foley.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep trying for all of our hostages, not just in Syria, but around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many are there?\xc2\xa0 If I can just ask -- how many American hostages are being held by ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Jon, we don\'t want to put out a specific number, again, out of respect for the fact that there are sensitivities involved with that.\xc2\xa0 But this is a small number of hostages who are held within Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do whatever we can to try to bring them home.\xc2\xa0 Every day that they\'re in custody there is a day that they\'re at risk.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the White House, the President said the goal was to contain ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State two days later said the goal was to destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Which is it?\xc2\xa0 And how far and how long are we prepared to carry out whichever campaign it is?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, I think the President has spoken to the fact that our military objectives in Iraq right now are limited to protecting our personnel and facilities and addressing this humanitarian crisis.</p>\n<p>We have to be clear that this is a deeply rooted organization.\xc2\xa0 They have been there for 10 years, when you go back to AQI.\xc2\xa0 It is going to take time, a long time, to fully evict them from the communities where they operate.\xc2\xa0 We can do things, though, in the immediate term to address the threat to the United States and our people and to push them back, and to give space for these security forces who are taking the fight to them.\xc2\xa0 We can create a coalition that can support Iraqis and the moderate Syrian opposition in their efforts to squeeze ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re doing.</p>\n<p>But it\'s going to take time.\xc2\xa0 When you talk about an objective like the ultimate defeat of ISIL, it\'s going to take time to dislodge a group that has been operating in this part of the world for the better part of a decade in an insurgency.\xc2\xa0 But what we can do is address the threat to the United States, give these security forces the space that they need, go on the offense, push them out of the communities that they\xe2\x80\x99re in, and then work towards that ultimate goal of defeating ISIL.</p>\n<p>And as the President said the other day, Major, this is a cancer that has to be eradicated, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how we look at this.\xc2\xa0 We have to have our near-term goals that put the safety of Americans front and center.\xc2\xa0 And then in the long term, we\'ll be working with our partners to defeat this organization.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying first contain, then destroy?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, obviously, by definition, Major, you need an immediate term to contain a threat -- so, yes.\xc2\xa0 But as you\'re doing that, you need to make sure that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a threat to the American people that we have the ability to take action.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President did, for instance, when they were bearing down on our facilities in Erbil.</p>\n<p>But we are already pushing them back.\xc2\xa0 You saw after we began our airstrikes, for instance, the Kurdish forces, with our support, were able to make advances and to retake a big piece of critical infrastructure in Iraq, the Mosul Dam.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the dynamic that we\'re seeking to foster, one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just contain, but that allows those forces on the ground to go on the offense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, one other issue -- and I don\'t know how much the President has been briefed on it the last couple of weeks, but obviously the Ebola crisis continues to mount in severity.\xc2\xa0 To what degree has the President been briefed on that?\xc2\xa0 And is there any serious consideration or dialogue going on with the administration of sending additional assets to the region, such as the USS Mercy or USS Comfort, which are platform naval vessel hospitals that might be able to provide some assistance to some number of people affected in those countries by this virus disease?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So we always look at whatever resource is necessary to deal with an outbreak like Ebola that we\'ve seen.\xc2\xa0 We have prioritized getting people and resources on the ground in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone, so that we\'re working to strengthen their public health architecture.</p>\n<p>There are clear steps that we believe they can take to contain the outbreak and to make sure that people are getting appropriate care.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we focused on with the CDC and other U.S. agencies.\xc2\xa0 And if there are opportunities for us to do additional things, we\'ll review those.\xc2\xa0 But the best solution in our mind is to put the public health infrastructure in place in those countries to contain this outbreak, treat those who are suffering from it, and ensure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread beyond their borders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) right now as an option?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates for you on additional military resources.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve focused on public health resources to date.</p>\n<p>Last one I\'ll take -- Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President announced the airstrikes in Iraq, he came to the American people and made a statement and he laid out a sort of specific case for what was happening, what was going to happen and what was not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 Do you all believe that that case that he made then covers what you might do in Syria as well, both from a kind of public relations perspective, what he needs to tell the American people?\xc2\xa0 And then on the legal side, are there things that he would -- if you all decide to take military action in Syria along the lines that you just talked about to protect American interests, would he have to come to Congress?\xc2\xa0 Would there be additional legal -- either here in the United States or international legal authority that he would have to seek to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, on your first question, Mike, look, the President always keeps the American people updated about the status of any military action and major foreign policy and national security actions.\xc2\xa0 Even since he announced those airstrikes earlier this month, I\'d note that he\xe2\x80\x99s spoken a number of times to developments in Iraq and developments associated with our efforts against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, I think any additional action that he would take is one that he would explain to the American people, whether it\'s in Iraq or anywhere else.\xc2\xa0 And we will keep the American people fully informed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think the American people understand that this President is very deliberate about the use of force.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rush towards a military option.\xc2\xa0 He takes very seriously when we put U.S. military action on the table, when we have our pilots flying missions like the airstrikes we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking in Iraq.</p>\n<p>However, I think the American people also understand that there are some threats that have to be dealt with, and we\'re dealing with the threat from ISIL in Iraq by protecting our people there.\xc2\xa0 And as we\'ve done against al Qaeda around the world, we\'ll take whatever action is necessary to protect our people.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has shown that he\xe2\x80\x99d do that, whether it\'s in Pakistan with the bin Laden operation, in Yemen, in Somalia.\xc2\xa0 We will take direct action against terrorists who threaten the United States even as we develop long-term solutions that empower partners on the ground.</p>\n<p>With respect to legal matters, I wouldn\'t want to prejudge an action that we haven\'t taken.\xc2\xa0 I would say that the actions we\'re taking in Iraq are obviously at the invitation of the Iraqi government and consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.\xc2\xa0 The action that we took to try to rescue hostages in Syria was entirely legal, of course, because we were seeking to save Americans from imminent danger.\xc2\xa0 And that is at the core of justification for military action.</p>\n<p>I think that any additional actions that we take we would want to consult with Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, the things that you had drawn about Iraq was that you were invited in, what you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 In Syria, that obviously wouldn\'t be the case.\xc2\xa0 So isn\'t there a distinction?\xc2\xa0 And wouldn\'t you have to --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to speak hypothetically about an action we haven\'t taken.\xc2\xa0 But to take the example of what we did, you don\'t need to be invited in if you\'re trying to rescue your people from imminent danger.\xc2\xa0 And so that was the basis for the action that we took to try to rescue our hostages.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we would obviously have a legal justification for any action we take.\xc2\xa0 And I do want to be clear -- we would consult with Congress.\xc2\xa0 This is, again, a problem that we have to deal with as a nation, and so whether it\'s our ongoing operations in Iraq or additional steps that may need to be taken against ISIL, we would carry those out in very close consultation with Congress about their support and their role in providing support for our efforts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow?\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. need to rethink its policy of not paying ransom for hostages?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We obviously understand that Americans who have loved ones who are in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way want to do anything to try to bring them home, and we provide support in any way we can with our military, our diplomacy, our intelligence resources, our law enforcement resources.\xc2\xa0 But as a matter of policy, we do not provide ransom or any funding for terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 We feel very strongly that it is not the right policy for governments to support the payment of ransom to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 In the long run, what that does is it provides additional funding to these terrorist organizations, which allows them to expand their operations.\xc2\xa0 It incentivizes the kidnapping of foreigners in ways that we\'ve seen, frankly, with organizations like ISIL and some al Qaeda affiliates.</p>\n<p>So, again, as a matter of policy, I think the U.S. government remains absolutely committed to the notion that we will not provide funding for terrorist organizations that we believe that only creates perverse incentives for those terrorist organizations going forward, and a source of funding.\xc2\xa0 And we want to cut off and choke off their sources of funding.\xc2\xa0 What we will do is use all the resources of the U.S. government to try to find and, if possible, bring home those Americans who are missing.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, that will include our military, our intelligence, our law enforcement and our diplomacy.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, just a quick note mostly of appreciation as we wind down our past few weeks here on the Vineyard.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a busy few weeks, and I appreciate your patience and flexibility as we move through a lot of breaking news and a lot of developments both up here, in Washington, and around the world.\xc2\xa0 So I appreciate you working with us.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your flexibility and also your feedback as we try to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re getting you the best and accurate and quickest information we could.</p>\n<p>With that, I will open it up to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has taken a lot of flak for going golfing this week during some of these tumultuous times.\xc2\xa0 Could you just explain why he does this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to get into the President\xe2\x80\x99s mindset on that.\xc2\xa0 I will say that, generally, I think that sports and leisure activities are a good way for release and clearing of the mind for a lot of us.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the gravity of the events that he\xe2\x80\x99s had to struggle with while he\xe2\x80\x99s been up here, has there been any consideration, any internal discussion of saying, hey, maybe a day off from golf might not be a bad idea?\xc2\xa0 I mean, particularly yesterday, when you\xe2\x80\x99re -- or particularly dealing with, in the wake of what happened with James Foley, and the President comes out and gives a very powerful statement on that murder, and then he goes right from here to a golf course.\xc2\xa0 Is there any discussion of maybe, in a circumstance like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to stay off the links for a little while?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Jon, you are right the President did give a powerful statement in this auditorium Wednesday afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I think that anyone wondering his views on both the situation with ISIL, that video, or his concern for the Foley family should go back and review that statement.\xc2\xa0 It was delivered from the heart.\xc2\xa0 It was candid.\xc2\xa0 It was honest and it was open.\xc2\xa0 And I think anyone trying to assess how seriously he takes the gravity of that situation should go back and watch that, or read it, or listen to it again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is, is the optics in what people see.\xc2\xa0 And you saw the kind of split-screen photos that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in newspapers yesterday -- the President making that statement, the terrible tragedy that the Foley family is dealing with, and then the shots of the President kind of laughing it up at the golf course right afterwards.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re asking about the optics.\xc2\xa0 But let me just take a minute to explain how we approach this.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, the President is focused on doing his job.\xc2\xa0 And to us, that\xe2\x80\x99s paramount.\xc2\xa0 And what I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that just because the President is in a different location doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing his job.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone in this room who\xe2\x80\x99s been covering this or following the President for the past few weeks could deny that the President has been deeply engaged on issues both domestic and abroad.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to understand, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s been evident, is that the issues the country is facing both on the international stage and back here at home have absolutely captured the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention while we\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just ask a quick follow-up to what Michelle was asking Ben about, about the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments last January, saying that these al Qaeda affiliates, like ISIL, are the \xe2\x80\x9cJV team.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And Ben said, well, in the last six months they have certainly grown in power and scope.\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say now, based on what Ben just told us, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, when he called groups like ISIL the \xe2\x80\x9cJV team\xe2\x80\x9d of al Qaeda, are no longer operative?\xc2\xa0 Is that no longer the President\xe2\x80\x99s view?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That would not be my take.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do too much --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he still thinks this group is the JV team?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President spoke about ISIL about 48 hours ago, and the brutality they committed, the barbaric acts, and everything the President is going to instruct the United States government -- both military, diplomatic and intelligence -- in order to see justice served.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any dispute right now, discrepancy right now about how the President views ISIL, because he spoke to you a few days ago about that.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would the President agree with what Secretary Hagel said yesterday then, that this is beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there seems to be these big differences of the way the administration words it, depending on who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to.\xc2\xa0 So can you sort of iron this out, and what is the view of what the Secretary said yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to iron this out, but I am going to, again, refer to what the President said a few days ago in which he said that ISIL has \xe2\x80\x9crampaged across cities and villages -- killing innocent, unarmed civilians in cowardly acts of violence.\xc2\xa0 They abduct women and children, and subject them to torture, [and] rape and slavery.\xc2\xa0 They have murdered Muslims -- both Sunni and Shia -- by the thousands.\xc2\xa0 They target Christians and religious minorities, driving them from their homes, murdering them when they can for no [other] reason.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they have \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared their ambition to commit genocide against an ancient people.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are equivocating or parsing our approach on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in those terms, is that beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think that, A, Ben addressed this a little bit ago; B, the President has addressed this a little bit ago.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be here to sort of parse the differences between al Qaeda and ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Both are clearly terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 Both want to do harm to innocent people.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on counterterrorism speaks for itself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he agree with Secretary Hagel\xe2\x80\x99s assessment, though?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 That what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That this is beyond -- a threat beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, or that ISIS is a force beyond anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think how the President views ISIL has been articulated a couple times now.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On domestic policy, could you give us the White House take on new accommodations made for those who had opposed legally and through other means the birth control requirements for some religious-affiliated groups, or private businesses that have registered objections?\xc2\xa0 I understand there\xe2\x80\x99s some new developments on that.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Major.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, today the administration took several steps to ensure women, whose coverage is threated, receive coverage for recommended contraceptive services through their health care plans at no additional cost, as they should be entitled to under the Affordable Care Act, while continuing the administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal of respecting religious beliefs.\xc2\xa0 The rules, which I believe you\xe2\x80\x99re referencing, are in response to recent court actions and balance our commitment to helping ensure women have continued access to coverage for preventative services important to their health, while respecting the administration\xe2\x80\x99s goal of respecting religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So non-profits?\xc2\xa0 And some of these companies that object can now opt out of paying directly for these birth control services?\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I actually think that what these rules do are help ensure that women have access to contraceptive coverage.\xc2\xa0 The administration believes the accommodation is legally sound.\xc2\xa0 But in light of the Supreme Court order regarding Wheaton College, the departments are augmenting their regulations to provide an alternative for objecting non-profit religious organizations to provide notification, while ensuring that enrollees in plans of such organizations receive separate coverage of contraceptive services without cost-sharing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you help me understand who pays?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s two separate rules -- one for the non-profits and one for the closely held profits.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to refer you to HHS on how those are implemented.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you think this will be the end of this?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Do I think this will be the end of it?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I know that -- well, we, first and foremost, want Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be our sort of bedrock principle on this.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Congress can and should act to ensure that any women affected by recent Supreme Court actions get the same coverage options that everyone else has offered.\xc2\xa0 Legislative action is the quickest and best way to ensure that women get access to the services they need, and we call on Congress to act quickly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But until then, this is your final regulatory move in this sphere?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I know that this particular step will have a few steps along the way, so I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The GAO has ruled that the administration broke the law in the Bergdahl swap by not notifying Congress and by using federal funds inappropriately.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to challenge that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to surprise you to know that we strongly disagree with GAO\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, and we reject the implication that the administration acted unlawfully.\xc2\xa0 The President has the constitutional responsibility to protect the lives of Americans abroad, and specifically to protect U.S. servicemembers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s important for everyone here to understand that the GAO report expressly does not address the lawfulness of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s actions as a matter of constitutional law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be your reaction to it then?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think I just read one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you just -- is there recourse on the part of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is there recourse -- the GAO has issued a finding that you disagreed with.\xc2\xa0 Are you simply going to ignore it?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I could tell you that the administration\xe2\x80\x99s actions occurred only after the Secretary of Defense determined that the risk posed by the detainees to the United States or U.S. persons of interest was substantially mitigated and that the transfer was in the national security interests of the United States, as required by the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>At the time, Wendell, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, the President was very clear that our commitment to men and women serving overseas to leave none of them behind is a bedrock principle for him, one that doesn\'t come with caveats.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he acted in that manner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So help me understand the impact of the GAO ruling.\xc2\xa0 Is there any?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve asked for the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve given that to you.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the impact of the GAO, you might want to check with the GAO.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, has the President spoken to Attorney General Holder since Holder was in Ferguson?\xc2\xa0 And what does the President think of the current status there and what should happen going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Peter.\xc2\xa0 The President has been in touch with the Attorney General since the Attorney General was in Missouri.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been encouraged by what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past few days.\xc2\xa0 The President, last week and then on Monday, I believe, called for a de-escalation in the tensions.\xc2\xa0 That was paramount for him.\xc2\xa0 And so far we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the developments of the past few days.</p>\n<p>To answer your question, the President has been in touch with the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 The President and many of us at the White House are closely monitoring and receiving regular briefings on the situation in Ferguson.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the Department of Justice opened an investigation -- an independent, federal civil rights investigation into the death of Michael Brown.\xc2\xa0 And both the President and Attorney General have committed to a fair, thorough and independent investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did the Attorney General tell him?\xc2\xa0 What were his impressions that he shared with the President?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into their sort of internal communications.\xc2\xa0 I think the Department of Justice has put out a lot of readouts of that trip.\xc2\xa0 And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s well covered by your colleagues.</p>\n<p>I can tell you that the President felt that the Attorney General had a very good and worthwhile trip to Ferguson.\xc2\xa0 He met with members of the community, the congressional delegation, local officials, along with FBI agents and DOJ personnel conducting the federal criminal investigation, and he received an update on each of their progress.\xc2\xa0 He also met with the parents of Michael Brown.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just ask a question that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked by media in St. Louis.\xc2\xa0 Do you foresee the President ever going there to personally address what happened?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any scheduling announcements at this time.\xc2\xa0 I do think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President speak about this again so very openly and candidly over the past few days, speak at length about how he views the situation in Ferguson.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General went out there earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 And so he\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to monitor this, and his first and foremost priority is with the safety of those in Ferguson.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on where the President stands in terms of his decision-making process for announcing a potential executive order on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 As I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, on June 30th, the President spoke to you all in the Rose Garden, and that was on the heels of being informed by Speaker Boehner that the House Republicans were not going to bring up immigration reform for a vote.\xc2\xa0 As you may also recall, we believe that that bipartisan bill passed by Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate should be brought up for a vote.\xc2\xa0 We are not even asking House Republicans -- or the House leadership to vote for it; we\xe2\x80\x99re just asking for them to bring it up for a vote -- because I\xe2\x80\x99d bet you a good deal that that would pass with both Democrats and Republicans in the House.</p>\n<p>That said, Speaker Boehner did inform the President -- we were fairly forthcoming in that.\xc2\xa0 And on the heels of that, the President announced in the Rose Garden that he was directing the Director of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to identify additional actions the administration can take on its own within the President\xe2\x80\x99s existing legal authority to do what Congress refuses to do, and fix the broken immigration system that\'s been plaguing our country for many years now.\xc2\xa0 If Congress is not going to do their job, the least we can do is ours.\xc2\xa0 And the President expects their recommendations by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any additional updates for me to read out at this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten any of the recommendations yet?\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sort of begun his own decision-making process yet?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the status of the recommendations incoming to the White House.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you the President has put a great deal of thought into this already, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard many times.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as we have anything definitive, any announcements, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you get those.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just given that this number of 5 million people potentially being able to stay in the United States has been floated around -- I know that\'s a number that has come from some of the advocacy groups -- but is the President open to going that far, allowing 5 million of the 11 million illegal immigrants who are currently here to stay here?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 As you point out, those numbers are in the newspaper.\xc2\xa0 They were not put out by us in the administration.\xc2\xa0 We are preserving the sort of integrity of this process to allow the President to receive those recommendations from the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to review those.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said, he wants to act by the end of the summer.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one final question, following up on Wendell, on Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 We heard Ben describe the U.S. policy as paying no ransom for hostages, yet the U.S. released Taliban operatives in order to get Bergdahl back.\xc2\xa0 Why does one policy lead to more kidnappings but the other one does not?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, what the President made clear at the time of the Guantanamo transfer was that his commitment to the men and women that serve overseas is a bedrock one that we will leave no man or woman behind.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he was keeping faith with, and that\'s something that\'s unshakeable for him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As we\xe2\x80\x99ve made previously clear, the administration determined that it was lawful to proceed with the transfer in order to protect the life of a U.S. servicemember held captive and in danger for almost five years, notwithstanding that Congress did not receive the 30 days\xe2\x80\x99 notice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, we disagree with GAO\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion and reject the implication that the administration acted unlawfully.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Steve, it is with great regret that I do not have a week ahead for you -- despite my best efforts.\xc2\xa0 But we will have that on paper later today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The growth of ISIS that you guys have talked about, rapidly, even in the last six months, how much of that would you attribute to the payment of ransoms by other countries?\xc2\xa0 And how much will the administration be working with other countries or pressuring them not to keep paying these enormous ransoms?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I will reiterate what Ben said, which is our policy is clear:\xc2\xa0 The United States government, as a matter of longstanding policy, does not grant concessions to hostage-takers.\xc2\xa0 Doing so would put more Americans at risk of being captive and would be a funding stream for these terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just U.S. policy; this is a growing international norm.\xc2\xa0 In January of this year, the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2133, an unprecedented resolution which identifies kidnapping for ransom as a source of terrorist financing, expresses the Council\xe2\x80\x99s determination to secure the safe release of hostages without ransom payments or political concessions, and calls upon all member states to prevent terrorists from benefitting directly or indirectly from such concessions.</p>\n<p>Thank you, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:41 P.M.
