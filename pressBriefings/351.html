EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s already been obviously a busy Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 A couple of things.\xc2\xa0 You heard from the President in the Oval Office about his personal reaction to the terror attacks that we saw in Paris very early this morning East Coast time.\xc2\xa0 The President does intend to try to get in touch with President Hollande at some point today.\xc2\xa0 Obviously President Hollande is very busy dealing with the immediate response to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President to speak to him today we\'ll try and take advantage of that, and we\'ll let you know once that call has occurred.</p>\n<p>You also, prior to takeoff, have just been in a conference call about the announcement that the President intends to make tomorrow related to assistance that we can offer to responsible middle-class homeowners across the country.\xc2\xa0 The President will have more to say about that tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 There is a factsheet that our office back in Washington should be distributing here shortly.</p>\n<p>But today, the President is traveling to Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Michigan Assembly Plant just outside Detroit.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to have some more background on this facility.\xc2\xa0 It sounds, actually, like a pretty interesting place.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the world\xe2\x80\x99s first flexible manufacturing facility that\'s building gasoline-powered, hybrid and plug-in vehicles all on the same production line.\xc2\xa0 And this is pretty good evidence of the kind of innovation that is driving the success of the American auto industry right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This innovation and this new opportunity would not have been possible without the very difficult and, in some cases, legitimately politically unpopular decisions that the President made very early in his tenure in office to give the auto industry the space that it needed to make these kinds of -- to implement these kinds of innovations and rebuild their business.</p>\n<p>And they have come back stronger than ever.\xc2\xa0 And that is thanks in no small part to the very hard work of men and women in the American auto industry who have used their skill and determination to build the finest automobiles on the planet.\xc2\xa0 And that is something the President is very proud of.\xc2\xa0 The President has had a number of occasions -- many of you have covered them -- to visit American autoworkers working on the assembly line.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to that visit today, primarily because it highlights some of the resilience that we\'re seeing in the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President has a lot of other ideas for what we can do to build on that momentum to make sure that middle-class families are benefiting from the American economic recovery that\'s underway and that is the envy of the world.</p>\n<p>So the President will talk about that recovery today and talk about some of the ideas on Thursday and Friday that he has to build on that momentum.\xc2\xa0 You got a sense of what the President is going to talk about on Thursday in terms of what we can do to build on the momentum that we\'re seeing in the housing market. But we\'ll have obviously a lot more on that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>With that, let me go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With respect to the situation in Paris, does the U.S. have an assessment or have the French shared their assessment with the U.S. on who these gunmen were and whether they have any links to a larger terror group?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned earlier, the senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team have been in touch with their French counterparts since very early this morning.\xc2\xa0 In those conversations, the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, offered any needed assistance that the French have in trying to figure out exactly what happened, trying to determine who was responsible, bringing them to justice, and also determining exactly what their motivation was.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve offered all of the assistance that we can offer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are still in the early stages of tracking down those details, and the French are obviously very interested in finding this out, and this government is as well.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to provide them all the assistance that we can to try to get answers to some of these questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this point, you can\'t say whether these gunmen were linked to any terror organization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I cannot say that.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t rule it out either.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something we\'re still trying to determine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the U.S. response to the attack in France, is the U.S. concerned about any risk here from this group or similar groups, and is there any plan to raise threat levels or anything like that in response to the attacks in France?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is as it relates to the threat level.\xc2\xa0 This is a decision that\'s made by the Secretary of Homeland Security, that he makes a decision about raising or lowering the terror threat level based on available intelligence.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know of any plans to make a change to the terror threat level, but I would encourage you to check with the Department of Homeland Security to verify that.</p>\n<p>What I can tell you is that today\xe2\x80\x99s events in Paris that are so tragic are a reminder of how important it is for everybody to be vigilant about the threats that we face.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t say that to hint that somehow the French fell short of needed vigilance, only that today\xe2\x80\x99s tragic terror attack is an indication of just how serious a threat we face.\xc2\xa0 And there are men and women in the U.S. national security infrastructure that are working around the clock to try to protect the American people and American interests both here at home and around the world.</p>\n<p>The threat that we face is serious, but what we have is strong international cooperation with our partners around the globe to try to mitigate the threat that is posed by foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 We are working very closely with leaders in the Muslim community both at home and around the world to try to counter the violent extremist messaging that ISIL and other extremist organizations are using to try to radicalize individuals around the globe.</p>\n<p>There are some individuals that are using a peaceful religion and grossly distorting it, and trying to use its tenets to inspire people around the globe to carry out acts of violence. And we have enjoyed significant success in enlisting leaders in the Muslim community, like I said, both in the United States and around the world to condemn that kind of messaging, to condemn those efforts to radicalize individuals, and to be clear about what the tenets of Islam actually are.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to redouble those efforts in the days and weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And obviously, we\xe2\x80\x99re still trying to figure out exactly, like I said, who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for this attack in Paris, what their motivations are.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, we\xe2\x80\x99re very mindful of the threat from foreign fighters and the threat -- and the need to try to counter some of the extremist ideology that ISIL is propagating, using some pretty sophisticated social media strategies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President briefed about it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did have a Presidential Daily Briefing in the Oval Office this morning.\xc2\xa0 That was the first opportunity that he had to meet in person with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 And as you would expect, there was extensive discussion of this issue then.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any specific threats to news organizations or other groups in the United States that you guys are looking at?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are no specific pieces of credible information that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of that we are paying particular attention to now.\xc2\xa0 That said, as I mentioned in answer to Angela\xe2\x80\x99s question, we do continue to be very vigilant about this and there is a very active effort to monitor communications from ISIL that are made in public forums, to use our network of tools and our links to other countries that have a sophisticated intelligence infrastructure to try to monitor exactly what threats are emerging.</p>\n<p>So this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re carefully watching.\xc2\xa0 And this is obviously something that our intelligence community watches closely and something that the Department of Homeland Security is obviously on top of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So for an up-to-date assessment of the threat picture, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with the intelligence community and with DHS.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything right now that is the source of undue concern.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously concerned about a lot of things, but nothing that stands out at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This obviously isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first news organization that has published something that\xe2\x80\x99s been deemed offensive to Muslims. I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the President thinks -- whether he thinks that new organizations have any responsibility to not publish similar cartoons or articles, or whether that should be a decision that news organizations can (inaudible) regardless of threats.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that there is no legitimate act of journalism, however offensive some people might find it, that justifies an act of violence, particularly an act of violence on the scale that we saw today.\xc2\xa0 None.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, it is up to media organizations to make their own decisions about what they choose to publish, about what stories they choose to pursue, and what sort of commentary they want to broadcast about the world and about their government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we believe very deeply in the importance of a free and independent media.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the President putting himself into a position where he\xe2\x80\x99s offering advice or even direction about what should or should not be published by legitimate, independent journalists.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s up to journalists to decide.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the President, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, likes every single thing that\xe2\x80\x99s published.\xc2\xa0 But there is no piece of responsible journalism that, again, no matter how offensive some people may find it, that legitimizes an act of violence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he find it different from what happened with the situation with North Korea and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview\xe2\x80\x9d movie, where he said that he thought that the movie should be released?\xc2\xa0 He was putting himself in that position.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put himself in that position over journalism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do think I would draw a bit of a distinction between entertainment -- an entertainment company and something that would be more clearly branded as journalism.\xc2\xa0 There are probably graduate-level courses in trying to draw these kinds of lines, so I\'m going to hesitate to do that.\xc2\xa0 But I do think there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between those two things.\xc2\xa0 I think that even in the case of the decision that Sony had to make about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview\xe2\x80\x9d the President indicated that he disagreed with the decision that they had made, but the President made no bones about the fact that that was a decision that can and should be exercised by the leader of that company.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think the President, despite his outward criticism of the decision they made, wanted to leave anybody with the impression that he was trying to suggest that he\xe2\x80\x99s the one who should have made that decision instead.</p>\n<p>Other questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Detroit, is the President taking a victory lap here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that\'s the way I would describe it, no.\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say, though, is two things.\xc2\xa0 One is that we do want to take advantage of the opportunity to talk about the results of the very difficult policy decisions that the President made early on in his presidency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the things that\xe2\x80\x99s been pointed out in recent days to me is that it\'s not just that the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to rescue the auto industry was politically unpopular across the country.\xc2\xa0 It was essentially politically unpopular in Michigan for the President to take these steps to try to save the auto industry.\xc2\xa0 And that was a difficult thing for a newly elected President to do.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, I think that any sort of fair look-back at the last five years would indicate that the President made the right decision.\xc2\xa0 And I do think that that\'s worthy of some discussion.</p>\n<p>But nobody is -- the reason that the auto industry is experiencing the kind of success that they have now is because we see highly skilled, highly motivated workers showing up to work every day and doing really good work.\xc2\xa0 And they are implementing the innovative vision of executives in the American auto industry, and designers and scientists at those companies.\xc2\xa0 And because of that innovation and that entrepreneurialism and that commitment to hard work, we\'re seeing the success of the American auto industry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And one of the things that the President wants to do is, as we make policy decisions moving forward, he wants to figure out what other policies can we put in place that will allow those middle-class workers to continue to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s his view that that\'s not just good for those middle-class families, it\'s also good for our broader economy.\xc2\xa0 And the auto industry serves as a useful illustration of that fact.\xc2\xa0 And so I think that\'s what we\'re trying to convey here.</p>\n<p>There are obviously some other very important events happening in the world, but I do hope that this is a useful opportunity for us to highlight the momentum of the American economy, to remind people that some of that is thanks in part to difficult decisions that the President made early on, but that should give us some confidence in the fact that the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas for further strengthening the middle class and further supporting middle-class workers are worthy of advancement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I just think that we\'ll have the opportunity to debate this quite a bit in the weeks and months ahead, but that\'s a debate that we\'re looking forward to.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you say to the Democrats in Congress and elsewhere in the base who feel like the trade agreement talk is undercutting that kind of industrial approach that you\'re talking about and will hurt the Michigan economy and other parts of the economy long term?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a concern that was raised by some as the President was seeking to finalize the Korea Free Trade Agreement.\xc2\xa0 And the President vowed in hammering out that agreement to make sure that we would reach an agreement that was in the best interests of American workers and the best interests of American businesses and in the best interests of American industry, including the American auto industry.</p>\n<p>And again, that free trade agreement was ratified in 2011, I believe.\xc2\xa0 And so over the course of the three years we\'ve seen that the auto industry has only gotten stronger over the course the course of that time.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s a pretty good indication that the President\xe2\x80\x99s track record is strong when it comes to reaching the kinds of trade agreements that are in the best interests of American businesses, including the American auto industry.</p>\n<p>As the President seeks to open up additional markets overseas to American businesses, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to use the same guiding principle, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that whatever trade agreement that the President is able to reach is in the best interests of the American auto industry and in the best interests of American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing:\xc2\xa0 If presented with an agreement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t have a deal and the President won\xe2\x80\x99t agree to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s the only way we\'re going to get an agreement, is if we have terms that the President clearly believes are in the best interests of American businesses and American workers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the starting point.\xc2\xa0 That was true of the Korea Free Trade Agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think that is borne out and any additional trade agreements will be predicated on the same starting point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People in the auto industry argue that the Korea Trade Agreement has helped the Korean auto industry significantly more than the U.S. auto industry.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he\xe2\x80\x99ll address?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think the concern that a lot of people have, or at least that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the auto industry, is that additional -- by some in the auto industry -- is that trade deals with other countries are bad for American businesses.\xc2\xa0 And at least looking at the three years since that Korea Free Trade Agreement went into effect, it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been true for the American auto industry because it\xe2\x80\x99s only gotten stronger and more workers have been hired in that industry since that free trade agreement went into effect.</p>\n<p>So I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to analyze what impact the trade agreement had on the Korean auto industry, but I can say that, based on a pretty cursory review of the economic evidence, the impact on the American auto industry of the Korea Free Trade Agreement certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad and there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence indicating it probably was pretty good.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, the President\xe2\x80\x99s change with FHA will of course result in less revenue for FHA from insurance premiums.\xc2\xa0 Why did he decide to do this now when the insurance fund there is still below its mandatory cushion?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- and we can check with HUD on this -- this is a fairly technical issue -- but my understanding of the issue is this -- is that in recent years, because of the recovering health of the housing sector that that cash reserve has been tapped a lot less, which means that in the last couple of years they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been able to make significant progress in building back up those cash reserves.\xc2\xa0 And because of the current trajectory of those reserves, the President believes that now is an appropriate time for us to reduce the contributions to those reserves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And what that will do is that will give a break to middle class -- responsible middle-class homeowners while we continue to make progress in building up those reserves.\xc2\xa0 So now is an appropriate time to make that change in the mind of the President in a way that will be really good for middle-class families and good for the housing sector -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some momentum built up finally in the housing sector.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That was one of the lagging markets.\xc2\xa0 We saw the economy strengthen and make some pretty strong steps to strengthen over the last several years, but it\xe2\x80\x99s more recently that we\'re\xc2\xa0 starting to see similar signs of strengthening in the housing sector.\xc2\xa0 And so we can build on that momentum, the President hopes, by taking this step.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any chatter that you guys picked up ahead of time for the threat assessment or anything like that on the Paris attack?\xc2\xa0 Was there anything that -- I mean, we noticed Lisa Monaco was at the White House yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Defense Secretary Hagel was there yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Was there any indication that there was any sort of threat that you guys were worried about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that -- well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99d do is I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the intelligence community on that.\xc2\xa0 They can give you the best sense of the threat assessment both leading up to today\xe2\x80\x99s tragic terrorist attack but also in the aftermath as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to the auto industry for a second.\xc2\xa0 One of the things the President said was, that ship has sailed, I believe were his words, on the TPP and moving forward with trade. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hear your answer on that.\xc2\xa0 Could you just one more time go over sort of -- will he be saying anything about the TPP to the autoworkers today?\xc2\xa0 Will he be discussing that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you the short version, which is that the President has been very clear that any sort of trade agreement he reaches will be one that he believes is in the best interests of American businesses and American workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This was a commitment that he made in advance of the Korea Free Trade Agreement.\xc2\xa0 And since the Korea Free Trade Agreement was announced, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only seen the American auto industry continue to strengthen.\xc2\xa0 And so any sort of future agreement that the President reaches on trade would be predicated on the same core principle that we\xe2\x80\x99re only going to cut a deal that is clearly in the best interests of American workers, American businesses, and American farmers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if presented with an agreement that the President does not believe is in the best interest of the American auto industry and other important American manufacturing -- the American manufacturing sector or other core sectors of the American economy, the President simply won\xe2\x80\x99t make the deal, that we\xe2\x80\x99re only going to have an agreement that the President believes is clearly in the best interests of American workers and American businesses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:34 P.M.
