EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I want to begin with a brief comment about -- the Senate Republicans have once again today blocked a plan to allow hardworking Americans to refinance their student loan debt at today\xe2\x80\x99s low interest rates -- all in an effort to protect tax loopholes for the wealthiest among us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate, if not surprising, that Republicans in Congress have once again obstructed progress in Washington in order to protect millionaires and billionaires at the expense of hardworking, middle-class Americans.</p>\n<p>So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll open it up to questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, any reaction to Eric Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s loss and what that means for the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, particularly immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in Republican primary politics.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are a lot of people in your rolodex who have more keen insight on a Republican primary election to offer than I do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But that said, I do think that this -- the outcome does provide some evidence to indicate that the strategy of opposing nearly everything and supporting hardly anything isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a bad governing strategy; it\xe2\x80\x99s not a very good political strategy either.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has pursued a different approach.\xc2\xa0 The President has clearly laid out what his priorities are; has worked hard to build support across the country for those priorities.\xc2\xa0 These are priorities that will support middle-class families across the country, expand economic opportunity.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are shared by the vast majority of Americans.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to policies that will create jobs, reforming our education system, including by opening the door to a college education to more Americans, or even reforming our broken immigration system, the President is going to continue to look for opportunities to work with people across the aisle to find common ground to make progress on those core priorities.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has been doing for the last five and a half years, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is going to continue doing for the next two and a half.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has this changed the calculus at all as to when the President might take some executive actions on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have seen some analysis out there over the last 18 hours since the polls closed that I have to admit I\xe2\x80\x99m a little perplexed by.\xc2\xa0 I just moved to Virginia.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t move to the 7th District.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Majority Leader Cantor campaigned very aggressively against bipartisan, commonsense immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But yet, in the analysis, there are some who suggest that his election was the key to getting immigration reform done.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure how people have reached that conclusion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s my view, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the White House, that there is support all across the country for commonsense bipartisan immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There is bipartisan support for it in the Senate, where it passed.\xc2\xa0 There is also support across the country among leaders in law enforcement, the business community, in the labor community, in the faith community, who all understand that fixing our broken immigration system would be good for our economy and good for the country.</p>\n<p>A lot of Republicans are supportive of immigration reform along the lines of the compromise that had passed through the Senate because it significantly reduces the deficit by $900 billion over 20 years.\xc2\xa0 So there are any number of reasons why acting on immigration reform, like that passed through the Senate, is a good idea.\xc2\xa0 That compromise proposal is just as good today as it was before the polls opened yesterday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Eric Cantor\xe2\x80\x99s loss suggest that the forces that are against this on Capitol Hill -- the tea party and some of the conservatives who have been most vocal against is -- are not on the wane but, in fact, gathering strength?\xc2\xa0 And doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that then demand that the President do something different to try to get this through if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to get through, or to do something on the executive side that Congress can effect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say three things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, again, the Majority Leader campaigned very aggressively against comprehensive immigration reform and he lost.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m probably the last person that House Republicans should take political advice from, so I won\xe2\x80\x99t even offer it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that that will factor into their own political calculus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing I would point to are the results of the South Carolina Republican primary.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert in Republican Party politics, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be hard pressed to name a constituency more conservative than those who cast ballots in the South Carolina Republican primary.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham didn\xe2\x80\x99t just support comprehensive immigration reform in the Senate, he actually wrote the bill, or at least he helped write the bill -- he was among those who wrote the bill.\xc2\xa0 And he made no apologies about that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think he has made a, again, a persuasive case for why comprehensive immigration reform is the right thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 Senator Graham didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything in that piece of legislation that he hoped he would get, but the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t either.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of compromise.\xc2\xa0 But I think both Senator Graham and President Obama, who have starkly different political views, have found a lot to like in that piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the options that are before the President, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President continue to make a case for why Congress should act to fix or put in place reforms in our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 As the President announced several weeks ago, he\xe2\x80\x99s directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a review about the options that may be available through the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive authority to try to address some of the most persistent problems with our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 That review is still ongoing.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update at this point about the content or timing of that report, but that\xe2\x80\x99s something that remains on the table as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Iraq, the State Department has suggested the United States is going to give additional assistance to the Iraqis to stop this movement of militants from Mosul to Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 Can you detail what kind of assistance we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, what additional force the United States might use or other assistance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, give me one second here.\xc2\xa0 Let me start here:\xc2\xa0 The United States is deeply concerned about the continued aggression of ISIL in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 In addition to the violence in Mosul, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports and are closely following the ongoing attacks and violence in the Baiji and Tikrit areas, and other parts of northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The deterioration in security is rapidly becoming a humanitarian issue and requires a coordinated response by Iraqi leaders from across the country to halt the advances ISIL has made and regain control of territory currently in ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition, we condemn ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s despicable attack on the Turkish consulate in Mosul.\xc2\xa0 And we call for the immediate release of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s kidnapped diplomatic and security personnel.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in touch with the governments of Turkey and Iraq, and stand ready to provide any appropriate assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The situation in Iraq is grave and we\xe2\x80\x99re actively working with Iraqi leaders in support of their efforts to implement an effective and coordinated response to address this crisis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to provide all appropriate assistance to the government of Iraq, to assist it in our common fight against the threat that ISIL poses to Iraq in the region.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you say what \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate assistance\xe2\x80\x9d means?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details.\xc2\xa0 At the briefing yesterday I went through some of the material assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99ve provided in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s different today than it was at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the situation has deteriorated even in the last 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with the government of Iraq about what we can do to support them as they try to address this security threat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me point out one other -- mention one other thing that the President has talked about in the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 In his West Point speech, the President talked about this Counterterrorism Partnership Fund.\xc2\xa0 What the President has proposed is essentially $5 billion that will be put into a fund that could be used to support our coordination with partners throughout the region as they combat extremists and terrorist elements that are waging a war inside of Syria right now.\xc2\xa0 So what the President would like to see is additional resources that could be brought to bear to assist our coordination and consultation with countries that neighbor Syria and are most at risk of being drawn into the violence that\xe2\x80\x99s underway there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one quick follow-up to that -- you mentioned rapidly becoming a humanitarian issue.\xc2\xa0 That is an issue in which the President has used American force in the past -- to stop Muammar Qaddafi and in other cases.\xc2\xa0 Should that be read as a warning that the President is ready to use military force to stop a humanitarian disaster?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It should be read as the President being genuinely concerned about the hundreds of thousands of people who have been drawn into this conflict.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been drawn into it because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen extremists descend on this region of Iraq that includes one of the largest cities in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That violence has caused hundreds of thousands of people, according to reports, to be displaced from their communities, from their homes.\xc2\xa0 And the President is and the country is concerned about the basic needs of those people being met.</p>\n<p>We have provided a lot of humanitarian assistance to countries that are currently housing Syrian refugees that have fled Syria.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re very attentive to the wide range of humanitarian needs that are pretty severe in the region right now.\xc2\xa0 And those humanitarian needs seem to be growing rather quickly in the last couple of days, and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he considering stepping up that aid?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to report along those lines right now, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that the situation is getting worse.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you have basically a haven for extremists that\xe2\x80\x99s developing between Lebanon through Syria into Iraq now, which is bigger than the haven for al Qaeda ever was in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 How much of a direct security threat does the administration see this to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been talking for quite some time, since the very early days of the conflict in Syria, about the destabilizing impact that that could have on the broader region.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we are concerned about and continue to be concerned about.</p>\n<p>It poses a very different kind -- at this point, it appears to pose a different kind of threat to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interests, but a serious threat and one we continue to be concerned about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Different in what way?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, different in that core al Qaeda had repeatedly and publicly vowed to attack the United States homeland.\xc2\xa0 The threat in the region that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about now appears to be somewhat different, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we are watching very carefully for a variety of reasons -- because they\xe2\x80\x99ve proven to be very violent, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve demonstrated a willingness to consider targeting American interests and American allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s a threat that we take incredibly seriously.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that the President has been closely focused on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we value the cooperative relationship we have with a lot of governments in this region.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that the President is considering things like the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund to make sure that we are devoting the necessary resources to cooperate with our partners in these areas, to protect the United States of America and our interests and our allies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, Bashar al-Assad is claiming common cause with al-Maliki, claiming that he\xe2\x80\x99s battling the same kind of radical elements that are at play in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Is he wrong?\xc2\xa0 Why is that any different?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging al-Maliki to take tougher actions against the uprisings there.\xc2\xa0 Why is Syria different?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Syria is different in a couple of ways.\xc2\xa0 The first is that Mr. Assad has repeatedly used his armed forces to attack his own people, including those that were not involved in the conflict.\xc2\xa0 That violence has been terrible.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have roundly and repeatedly condemned.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s violence that\xe2\x80\x99s been condemned by leaders of countries all across the globe.</p>\n<p>So the approach that President Obama has pursued is to find ways to support the moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of ways that we can offer that support, both in the form of military and non-military assistance.\xc2\xa0 And that is assistance that we are constantly reviewing.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re routinely looking for ways to offer the kind of assistance that would be most effective.\xc2\xa0 And, as I mentioned earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also provided assistance in the form of humanitarian aid for those who have been displaced or caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>And so we have demonstrated a pretty comprehensive approach, but the tactics and strategy of the Assad regime to use the military might of that country against the Syrian people is despicable.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we have for some time now have been calling on a political transition to take place in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One on immigration again.\xc2\xa0 Senators Kirk and McCain wrote to the President today to ask him to use the power of his office to speak out against illegal minors coming across the border, down in Arizona.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he might be interested in doing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Stephen, I got asked about this a little bit yesterday at the briefing, and I pointed out that the law is pretty clear on this, that the deferred action that the administration put in place in terms of dealing with those who came to this country as minors only applies to those who have been in this country since before June of 2007.\xc2\xa0 So those who are attempting to cross the border now would not be granted that same kind of deferred action.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear across the administration about what the law is and how that law will be enforced, and our commitment to enforcing that law accordingly.\xc2\xa0 So that is the policy of the administration, something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President shares that view.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on guns.\xc2\xa0 His remarks yesterday caused quite a stir on guns.\xc2\xa0 Would it be fair to draw a conclusion that he\xe2\x80\x99s concluded that there\xe2\x80\x99s not really any possibility of any new legislative action during his presidency on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not drawn that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 I think what the President has concluded is that for legislative action to be successful, people all across the country are going to have to make their voices heard.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of polls that indicate that the vast majority of Americans support commonsense measures to reduce gun violence.\xc2\xa0 One example of that is closing loopholes in the background check law.\xc2\xa0 Doing so would make it harder for those -- for criminals and others who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to guns get access to them.\xc2\xa0 And we can do that, we can implement that law in a way that would protect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.</p>\n<p>But again, that piece of legislation is not going to pass without more grassroots-level, vocal support from people all across the country who hold that view.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned polls earlier indicate that a vast majority of Americans support that kind of approach.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s some polls that indicate a majority of Republicans actually support that approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But again, it is unlikely that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see any significant changes legislatively without more Americans standing up and making their voice heard, and making it clear to their members of Congress that this should be a priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you brought up polls, there are a couple of new ones out today that indicate that the public was not pleased with the way the Bergdahl release was handled and thought that Congress should have been consulted more.\xc2\xa0 Does the President regret the level of consultation that he offered to Congress on this in advance of the release, and in advance of nailing down the specifics of a deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the precision of your question in which you asked about the level of consultation, because there was consultation with Congress over the last several years about the possibility of executing a prisoner exchange like this to free Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think a lot of the dissatisfaction in Congress seems to stem from the fact that members of Congress were not notified of the precise operational details of a secret military mission before it was launched.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly well within their rights to be frustrated about that.\xc2\xa0 But as the Commander-in-Chief, the President feels a responsibility to safeguard -- or at least minimize the risk faced by our men and women in uniform -- both those who were responsible for executing this mission, but also for the life and wellbeing of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the frustration of some members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 I will say that that frustration notwithstanding, this administration has demonstrated a commitment to consultation with Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke at length last summer about his view that our foreign policy is stronger when you have bipartisan support in Congress for the foreign policy decisions that are made by the administration and implemented by the United States of America.</p>\n<p>So that consultation and cooperation and bipartisan support is something that we routinely actively seek, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you characterized members\xc2\xa0 of Congress as being upset over not knowing the precise operational details like what times does the helicopter land -- I assume is what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 What they\'re saying they\'re upset about, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about it, is that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t told this prisoner swap was actually happening or under what conditions, which I think is a much broader thing.</p>\n<p>And what I wonder is, A, whether you hear those concerns and are choosing not to listen to them, or that you\xe2\x80\x99re not hearing those concerns from members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And then the other thing I wonder is the extent to which dysfunction in Congress has been to your advantage on foreign policy where you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to do a lot on foreign policy without consulting Congress and getting no backlash.\xc2\xa0 Libya would be a good example.\xc2\xa0 Again, this Bergdahl thing where nobody is coming in and saying, look, the law is that you notify us; the rules and the norms are that you talk to the Big Eight before you do it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So two questions.\xc2\xa0 But let me -- go ahead, one at a time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the details of the prisoner swap, that was something that\'s been widely known.\xc2\xa0 This is something that had been consulted -- our administration had consulted with the relevant leadership in the committees about this precise prisoner exchange both in 2011 and 2012.\xc2\xa0 It also appeared on the front page of The Washington Post in February of 2014.\xc2\xa0 So the contours, the outlines of this proposed deal to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl were well known, not just by members of Congress, but also by members of the public, at least those who subscribe to The Washington Post.</p>\n<p>In terms of your other question about sort of notification, I tried to explain to Major and Jon when they asked about this yesterday that it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to -- the decision was made to execute this transfer in the context of a military operation that would involve flying military personnel to a remote region of Afghanistan to conduct this exchange.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to separate out a decision from the military operation that ensued.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is the people who pay for those military planes and pay for the intelligence on the ground and are charged by the American public and the Constitution with overseeing all those programs are not entitled to have any information even in the very, very secluded space of those Big Eight?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a problem?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I strongly disagree with your characterization there.\xc2\xa0 We consulted frequently with Congress over the years about the possibility of conducting this prisoner exchange.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as the mission was completed, you saw a number of senior administration officials getting in touch with senior members of Congress -- both on the relevant committees and in the leadership in both parties -- to give them details about what had happened.\xc2\xa0 You saw senior members of this administration go before every single member of the United States Senate in a classified session to explain to them and describe to them what exactly had happened, and to answer their questions about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You saw exactly the same thing happen in the House of Representatives just two days ago.\xc2\xa0 When the House of Representatives returned from their two-week Memorial Day recess, there was a classified session that was hosted for every single member of the House of Representatives to get a briefing from senior administration officials at the State Department, at the Defense Department, in our intelligence community, and at the White House to explain to them what had happened and to answer their questions about it.</p>\n<p>So there is a very clear commitment on the part of this administration and the White House to consult with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And this goes to what I think your second question was, which is this administration values bipartisan cooperation around our foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 The President gave a speech about this on national television, actually -- a primetime address where he described his view that our foreign policy is strengthened when it has bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we will continually seek it.</p>\n<p>But in this case, the Commander-In-Chief had to make a decision about living up to a commitment to leave no American serviceman or woman behind.\xc2\xa0 And he signed off on this operation, and it was executed.\xc2\xa0 It involved the transfer of prisoners.\xc2\xa0 It was predicated on certain security arrangements with the Qatari government.\xc2\xa0 The national security risks were mitigated.\xc2\xa0 And the President makes no apologies about that decision.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, at the same time, though, those long-ago consultations that you refer to were in the context of a broader agreement and a broader discussion with the Taliban, where there were other things that the Taliban would agree to do, not simply release Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 So isn\xe2\x80\x99t it -- are you saying that members of Congress were consulted on a specific swap, or were they consulted only in the broader sense?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard for me to get into the details of what those conversations were, Jim.\xc2\xa0 But I can confidently tell you right now that those consultations included explicit references to the release -- or the transfer of five Gitmo detainees in the exchange for the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 That was made explicit in those consultations in 2011 and 2012, and it was explicit in The Washington Post story, as well.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any member of Congress -- maybe I missed it -- but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard any member of Congress suggest that they would have been just fine with this deal had it also included an agreement from the Taliban -- pardon me -- had the deal also included an agreement from the Taliban to start talks with the Karzai government.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any member of Congress is raising that as an objection.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last time the White House consulted with Congress on this, in 2011 or 2012, the White House wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to make this deal.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to consult with Congress about a deal that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to make, that\xe2\x80\x99s a much different thing than consulting with Congress about a deal that you are going to make, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you agree?\xc2\xa0 That there\xe2\x80\x99s a change in -- a significant change in the substance of the conversation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to concede that point.\xc2\xa0 Why is that you think that this is a deal we weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to make back in 2011 or 2012?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, if you said to me right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to punch you in the nose, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to consult with you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to punch you in the nose, I\xe2\x80\x99d be like, okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s great, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Then you turn around two years later and you punch me in the nose and I go, well, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me you were going to punch me in the nose so I could duck you.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a substantive change in the position that you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken, and possibly one that people might be upset they weren\xe2\x80\x99t informed of.\xc2\xa0 Also I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend doing that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Under no circumstances am I going to punch you in the nose.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it might change in two years and you won\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure this analogy holds up, because the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a communications director or press secretary, but --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean it as a -- I mean that as a way to try to answer your question, not as a criticism of the way that you asked it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The point is we consulted in 2011 and 2012 about this precise aspect of the deal, right.\xc2\xa0 We floated the probability that we would consider transferring five -- these specific five detainees in Guantanamo in exchange for the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 That was something that we consulted with Congress on in 2011, in 2012.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately was a decision that the President ended up making.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are today.\xc2\xa0 And that is what I cite when I say that we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to consulting with Congress, and particularly our partners who lead relevant committees in Congress and have leadership positions in the United States House and the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing.\xc2\xa0 The President met with the Sentencing Commission today, which had made some recommendations.\xc2\xa0 Is the President signing off on that?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a bit of a readout of what the President\xe2\x80\x99s stance is after this meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do have a brief readout to share with you.\xc2\xa0 The President met with members of the U.S. Sentencing Commission to discuss their shared interest in a smarter, fairer and more effective criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 The commission is a bipartisan and independent agency in the judicial branch of the government, which is responsible for developing and revising the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p>As you know, these are issues the President and his administration have been working on for quite some time both through our administrative efforts in supporting the bipartisan work on the Hill for which the commission has also expressed support.\xc2\xa0 This is a priority that the President has talked about, trying to reform some of these guidelines.\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General has played a pretty active role in this reform process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There are some Republicans in the United States Senate who have indicated similar ideas for reforming the system.\xc2\xa0 And this was an opportunity for the President to talk directly with some of the professionals who were involved in devising that system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he signing off on anything at this point?\xc2\xa0 I believe one of the recommendations was up to 70 percent of certain drug felonies could be -- the policies could change for them.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new policy positions to announce out of that meeting today.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you on the ground.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:38 P.M.
