EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here on this very, very warm day in the summer in Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so I will go right to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben Feller of the Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m great, thanks.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your reaction to something that the Speaker said today in which he said the debt limit increase is the President\xe2\x80\x99s problem, and that President Obama has to put forward a plan that Congress can pass.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to those two things?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The need for the United States to take action so that it fulfills its obligations and pays its debts, as it has in the entirety of its existence, is not a Democratic problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a Republican problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an American problem.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we have to do together.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very strongly about this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would also note that while Congress has to vote to raise the debt ceiling, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vote in this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Congress that has to act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t stand up here yesterday and say, hey, show you a lot of charts and graphs about how previous Congresses under a Republican President accumulated enormous amounts of deficits and debt, and that this is what they needed to vote -- to deal with, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t his problem.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that.\xc2\xa0 He believes it\xe2\x80\x99s his responsibility as the President of the United States to lead, to work with Congress to resolve these issues together for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly where this President stands, and it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly I think the way that the American people view this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we were to default on our obligations, who suffers?\xc2\xa0 Democrats, Republicans or Americans?\xc2\xa0 Americans suffer.\xc2\xa0 The American economy suffers.\xc2\xa0 The global economy suffers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about I guess the broader issue here?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s statement that I read; you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Senate Republican leader, Senator McConnell, offering a harsh speech today on the floor in which he questioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and said that the real solution to this problem probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen as long as this President is in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious what -- is this whole process right now moving forward or backwards?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I think was said was unfortunate, because this President has made clear his willingness to compromise, to take heat from his own party, to do things that would force him and Democrats to move outside their comfort zone in order to meet Republicans halfway to achieve a significant deficit reduction deal the likes of which I think the American people deserve.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is an opportunity that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be passed up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This President is going to be in office for at least another 18 months, and I think that the American people expect Congress to work with him.\xc2\xa0 And this President surely expects and will make every effort to work with this Congress, as he has.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there really isn\xe2\x80\x99t an option.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in answer to your question about which direction the process is moving in, I mean, by fits and starts, the process continues to move forward because despite elevated rhetoric, the fact is everyone recognizes, everyone who has been in that room and who will be in that room again this afternoon recognizes that there is no alternative here to taking action and dealing with the problems before us, that there has to be a compromise and, in the end, together, we have to do the right thing so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t default on our obligations and so that we can achieve significant deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President hear Senator McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s speech on the floor?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He was in meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a more specific reaction to what McConnell said?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I addressed it a little bit, but if you have a specific question about a thing that he said --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it helpful to this process?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that Americans expect their leaders in Washington to talk to them, not to talk -- not to take actions based on the demands of the most vocal elements of their parties, okay?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true of Democrats and it\xe2\x80\x99s true of Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, no one will get everything he or she wants out of this process.\xc2\xa0 No one will be wholly satisfied by the result.\xc2\xa0 The President knows he won\xe2\x80\x99t be, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll be satisfied by the achievement of an agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced and that gets important things done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he will continue to work with leaders of both parties, beginning again this afternoon in the Roosevelt Room, to try to find common ground and to reach a compromise so that we can move this process forward and fulfill our obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even with elevated rhetoric, as you said, aside, on both sides, both positions seem to be very entrenched.\xc2\xa0 How do you see a deal coming when neither side, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the White House, congressional Democrats or congressional Republicans, are indicating any hint on moving on those specific positions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said throughout this process, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- sometimes there\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric that has been put out there in public that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily match what has often been very constructive and respectful conversations in the meetings, and usually has been.\xc2\xa0 So I think that the leaders will come together, the President and the Vice President will come together, and they will continue to push forward towards an agreement, because there is no alternative here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said, the President has said, and the leaders themselves have said, the consequences of default would be so severe, and they would not be esoteric.\xc2\xa0 This would not be just a Wall Street problem.\xc2\xa0 It would be a problem for Americans on Main Streets across the country.\xc2\xa0 It would affect jobs, it would affect interest rates that directly affects housing payments and credit card payments, and it would be severe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think everyone sees that reality and recognizes is.\xc2\xa0 The path from here to there will certainly be challenging, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 Do you have specific benchmarks that you would like to see reached on a daily basis as these talks continue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 We are very aware of and we remind others in the room of the fact that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time here.\xc2\xa0 August 2nd is a hard and fast and real deadline.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs time to do the things it would have to do to produce legislation, so we have to back up from that deadline.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re in the matter-of-days phase of these negotiations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitch McConnell said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn my view, the President has presented us with three choices:\xc2\xa0 smoke and mirrors, tax hikes or default.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans choose none of the above.\xc2\xa0 I hoped to do good, but I refuse to do harm.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I would simply ask you, as you and everyone else in this room and other reporters who are covering this, whether you think that\xe2\x80\x99s true, because what -- for better or worse -- well, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually not true.\xc2\xa0 For better or worse, a lot of what has been on offer, a lot of what has been considered and talked about, is now out in the public domain.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any credible observer of these negotiations and analysts of the general problems we have, in terms of deficit and debt reduction, who would not say that we have not been credible? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we have a general --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, who would say that we have not been credible.\xc2\xa0 Because the fact is, this President is willing to do significant things, in terms of discretionary cuts, entitlement reform that strengthens the programs and increases their solvency further into the future for future generations -- tough things that will not be easy to convince Democrats to go along with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to do that, because he thinks that\xe2\x80\x99s what leadership requires.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not standing here saying, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to do; he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, I have to do it because I\xe2\x80\x99m President and it\xe2\x80\x99s important and this is an opportunity that we should not pass up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in the spirit of rebutting this idea that it\xe2\x80\x99s all been smoke and mirrors, is the President willing to raise the retirement age for Medicare and Social Security?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no reason for me, from here, or for the President, from here, when he was here several times in recent days, to negotiate the particulars from the podium.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to negotiate it; I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you to explain it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And -- well, what we have said is -- what the President stood here and said, not with regard to a specific proposal, is that a lot of the reporting out about what has been under consideration has been accurate.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say, for those of you -- most of you who are familiar with these issues and know what hard choices are, to judge for yourselves whether that -- whether the kinds of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been willing to consider do not constitute significant demonstrations of willingness to compromise.\xc2\xa0 And I think the answer is, they absolutely do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this President has never taken a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway\xe2\x80\x9d approach, because he understands that he\xe2\x80\x99s not a monarch, that we live in a great democracy built upon a two-party system, and by and large, nothing big gets done in Washington unless Democrats and Republicans come together.\xc2\xa0 And they only come together if each side is willing to give, the way Ronald Reagan did and Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill did, the way Bill Clinton did and Newt Gingrich did, and many of their predecessors in American history.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way this gets done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in the end, because the elected officials who are here are here representing the American people, I think it will get done.\xc2\xa0 And we will press up until the very end for the biggest possible deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if I missed this, but have you guys -- has the White House reacted at all to what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on at the U.S. embassy in Syria, the demonstrations and the violence?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And we have, and the Secretary of State has.\xc2\xa0 I think --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements from State.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you -- if the White House has a response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that, echoing what Secretary Clinton said, our position is that President Assad is not indispensible and that we had called on him to lead this transition.\xc2\xa0 He clearly has not and he has lost legitimacy by refusing to lead the transition. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want to see the Syrian people\xe2\x80\x99s desire for democratic transformation carried out.\xc2\xa0 The attacks or the thugs storming the embassy is not acceptable, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear to the Syrian government that it is their responsibility, as it is the responsibility of host nations around the globe, to provide security for and to maintain security for foreign embassies, in this case the U.S. embassy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the White House think there has been such tolerance of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behavior among other Arab leaders who did not -- who denounced Qaddafi?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to that question for you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what we have said has been very clear about its -- the unacceptable things that he\xe2\x80\x99s done, the killings and the arrests that have continued.\xc2\xa0 Even when he had the opportunity to have this meeting with the opposition on July 10th, the unacceptable behavior by the government, the attacks on its people continued.\xc2\xa0 And that proved that he was not going to lead this transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Specific to these talks, are you saying then that the rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing in public from Republicans does not match the tone of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on inside the room? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the tone inside the room has by and large been frank and constructive and not highly contentious at all.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t disagreements.\xc2\xa0 But as was the case certainly in the Biden-led talks, the atmosphere continues to be constructive and respectful.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that to continue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think the Republicans are then playing to their base by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play political analyst from here.\xc2\xa0 I just think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that we will not get from here to there, either side, if we heed only the calls of our most ideological supporters.\xc2\xa0 We have to be -- we have to acknowledge that maximalist positions will not prevail.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- logic dictates otherwise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this is not an esoteric exercise because we have the absolute accepted need to deal with fulfilling our obligations and paying our debts.\xc2\xa0 So in the end, the President remains optimistic that we will reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to fight for the most substantial deficit reduction package possible, and he will continue to -- in the meeting this afternoon and his discussions from this day forward with leaders -- remind them that none of this is easy, so if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something hard, you might as well go big.\xc2\xa0 You might as well do something historic and reach a significant deficit reduction package, a package that deals with our long-term debt issues for many years to come and allows us to put the American economy back on solid footing as we enter into sort of full-bore competition in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the best outcome here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the outcome he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to find.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So while the President pushes for that big deal, will he also be reviewing the math on the more mid-range package that was discussed in the Biden talks?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said for a while now, smaller deals are possible -- I mean, not the short-term ones that he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear he will not sign because we are the United States of America; we do not come to the brink of defaulting on our obligations every several weeks or months -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But deals short of the so-called grand bargain, the deals that put us in the $4 trillion range over 10 to 12 years are certainly possible, and he has asked on two occasions now, when meetings ended, for the leaders who have come to come to the Roosevelt Room, to bring with them their proposal for what can get us to the biggest deal possible.\xc2\xa0 And each member\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the biggest deal possible might -- will obviously differ in size.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re doing serious work, both in the room and at the staff level.\xc2\xa0 But the President will continue to push and argue for the most significant package and balanced -- that will, in a balanced way, achieve a big number that does something substantial in what he said yesterday, the out-years. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the reasons to do the bigger deficit reduction package, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about -- this has been the primary objective, based on their own words, that the Republicans have put forward since the midterm elections last fall.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this was a moral imperative, this is an economic imperative, we have to get our deficits and debt under control, and the President is saying, okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And since we have to do it together, then we have to compromise, because obviously the purist position on the Republican side will not pass, will not become law, and the purist position on the Democratic side will not pass and become law.\xc2\xa0 So the alternative is compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, John Boehner also says that during their weeks -- in fact, he said two months -- of discussions, a couple months of discussions, the idea of raising taxes was never even on the table.\xc2\xa0 True?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President from the beginning, since his speech at George Washington University, has made clear that the approach he brought to the table, that the Vice President brought to the table, was a balanced approach that included dealing with spending in our tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about in the private conversations with John Boehner --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize those conversations, except that a grand bargain, a significant deficit reduction deal, is not possible if it\xe2\x80\x99s not balanced, and certainly not possible in a divided government with this President and this Congress.\xc2\xa0 So the -- but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the specifics of the negotiations or the private, one-on-one conversations between the Speaker and the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And shifting gears, Bernie Sanders was on the floor of the Senate today and he noted that President Obama in 2008, in a taped addressed to AARP, said \xe2\x80\x9cJohn McCain\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has suggested that the best answer for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut cost-of-living adjustments or raise the retirement age.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear:\xc2\xa0 I will not do either.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that a promise that has gone by the bye, at least regarding cost-of-living adjustments?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will not get into the specifics of ideas that have been considered.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that the President has been willing to get outside of his comfort zone to discuss different measures, to do what he has said -- will go to the general program there in terms of Social Security -- that he firmly believes -- and economists back him up on this -- that Social Security is not an issue when you talk about our near- and medium-term deficits.\xc2\xa0 But he is interested in taking steps to increase its solvency and strengthen the program.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into is which specific measures might be taken to do that.\xc2\xa0 But, again, when we talk about making hard choices, he has demonstrated his willingness to do that because he thinks the American people want something big.\xc2\xa0 And the reason, when we talk about Social Security, even though it is not a driver, it is not the problem when we talk about our deficits, it does have long-term solvency issues that can be -- that can be addressed and we can strengthen the program.\xc2\xa0 And he has said that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some tough decisions now in the interest of getting something big, that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to have those conversations about all entitlements, including Social Security.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, this is not -- this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve always, from the State of the Union address on, talked about on a separate track, separate from the need to deal with our deficits.\xc2\xa0 But he is willing to do, in the name of doing something big and comprehensive, talk about what he talked about in the State of the Union, which is take measures that would strengthen it and increase its solvency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 More generally, then, without asking about what they specifically talked about on Social Security, is the situation now so severe that when the President talks about making tough choices and getting out of your comfort zone, that that means being willing to break firm promises that he made previously?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what exactly you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to except for the one you just --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you won\xe2\x80\x99t answer the specific question, so maybe the general.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that it requires making tough choices, and compromise requires not necessarily being exactly where you were in your ideal world.\xc2\xa0 When you put a proposal forward in Congress that passed the House, even though it had no chance in the Senate and no chance to be signed into law, you could stick with that as your absolutist position, or you can recognize that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get that and that we are absolutely under an obligation to reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0 You can put forward a framework, as the President did in April at George Washington University, for his vision of $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 to 12 years, that deals with spending in entitlements and discretionary spending, defense spending and the tax code.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can also recognize that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get that exactly the way you wrote it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, my understanding is the President, in the interview with CBS, has suggested that there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern that Social Security checks may not go out August 3rd.\xc2\xa0 Can you provide us a little context on that, and did he indeed say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s up to CBS to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to scoop their interview, but the -- and I think that will air tonight -- I mean, the fact of the matter is, and Secretary Geithner has talked about this -- I mean, we no longer have authority to borrow money if we do not raise the debt ceiling, which we remain confident will happen, so this is speculative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the fact is one of the reasons why we absolutely have to take action is because we stop -- we lose our authority to borrow money.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, we have obligations that exceed the money we take in -- significantly exceeds the money we take in.\xc2\xa0 And that would then entail a kind of Sophie\xe2\x80\x99s choice situation where you have to decide what bills you can pay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security checks or veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits or disability benefits -- I mean, there is -- there are -- the number of decisions that would have to be made -- and this is beyond my expertise, so I encourage you to go to Treasury -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that the effect will be significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, no, we can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee, if there were a default, any specific bill will be paid.\xc2\xa0 Because the choices that some have said -- oh, we can just pay interest, so we can pay the bond holders, in some cases and in many cases Chinese -- the Chinese government, but not pay Social Security recipients or veterans or benefits recipients.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of choice that nobody wants the United States of America to have to make, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the leaders have been clear that we will vote to have the United States fulfill its obligations, and the President feels strongly that that will happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the change in tone, where you hear some Republican leaders saying today that they feel like we may be heading for a missed opportunity in terms of a big deal, suggest that we\xe2\x80\x99re heading for an August 2nd nail-biter on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is an unfortunate reality that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen with the CR, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so many times, that we tend to -- that Congress tends to push these things up to the very last minute.\xc2\xa0 While that\xe2\x80\x99s inconvenient, in many cases, it is the way things happen.\xc2\xa0 In this case, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than inconvenient because of the -- even before August 2nd, the possibility -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s perceived to be a possibility -- that Congress will not act in time could have an effect on markets, could have an effect that would be damaging to the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important and the President\xe2\x80\x99s made it clear:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not -- let\xe2\x80\x99s get this done sooner rather than later, and the clock is ticking.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick one on another topic.\xc2\xa0 We understand an executive order is coming related to a gun-related issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already heard from some groups, lawmakers expressing concern that this could be trampling on Second Amendment rights.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I would refer all -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the long gun issue on the Southwest border? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My understanding was changes to the database used for background checks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t even -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even aware of that.\xc2\xa0 There is obviously an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s about -- which is this is a law enforcement issue about illegal gun trafficking to the Mexicans on the border states is the long gun one, which I refer you to the Justice Department for.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t even -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow up on that just very quickly?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to yours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that a new regulation is going to have a real impact on stopping the illegal flow of arms to Mexico?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the Deputy Attorney General said yesterday, this targeted measure will improve the ability of ATF to detect and disrupt the illegal weapons-trafficking networks responsible for diverting firearms from lawful commerce to criminals and criminal organizations.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we believe it will improve the ATF\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to something you just said.\xc2\xa0 You described the tone of the meetings as frank and constructive.\xc2\xa0 Given the fact that some people with knowledge of the meetings have described them as essentially being stalled, can you explain specifically --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say they had come to agreement on the issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s been constructive about them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, it was the contrast to some of the heated, fairly partisan rhetoric that has been heard elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting that in the room, which is not to say sometimes there aren\xe2\x80\x99t starkly absolutist positions expressed in the room.\xc2\xa0 That happens sometimes, but they\xe2\x80\x99re done in very calm and constructive tones.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At this point heading into the fourth meeting --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is that constructive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- what do you think the meetings have accomplished so far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the meetings have made clear the absolute imperative to take action, to have the United States make sure that it fulfills its obligations.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been very -- remember that most people in that room were not participants in the negotiations led by the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 Some were, but not all.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a level of detail and specificity that essentially others are being brought into. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, obviously, not everybody was involved in conversations that the President and the Speaker of the House were having.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of broadening of the knowledge base about what has been discussed, where are the possible areas of compromise, and where are the challenges, the disagreements that still exist, and various ways to get from small to big. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some people have described the meetings as not having accomplished anything, though.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe, going into meeting number four, where are we now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that this only gets done if we act together, and that means the President and the leaders of Congress of both parties.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the meetings easy.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that every minute of every meeting is highly productive.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s essential that we have these meetings to get our work done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, really, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be pleasant for it to be essential. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And also I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that it\xe2\x80\x99s unpleasant.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s really not a choice here.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s not like if we just break up and go do something else that the problem goes away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern, given the heated rhetoric that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard today, that the talks could break down at the end of today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because I think that there are no alternatives to continuing to talk and to find compromise, and I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that the Biden-led negotiations, as asserted by participants in both parties, made significant progress, and that, as the President made clear here yesterday, he and the Speaker of the House had very constructive talks. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Out of that, there should be -- and certainly the American expect -- people demand that there be potential for compromise.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re working towards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Until just recently, most -- there have been a lot of conversations about changing the cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security, but it was always in the context of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There you go again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- always in the context of a Social Security plan, trying to make Social Security solvent for the long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you respond to people who would say that that that\xe2\x80\x99s the appropriate way to do this, not as part of a debt negotiation -- deficit -- overall deficit --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just answered this, in that the President does believe that this is a separate issue but it is also an important issue, and that the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s a separate track doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that if there\xe2\x80\x99s the political will to do it as part of this overall package, then we should do it.\xc2\xa0 And by \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d I mean not addressing the specific measures that you raise -- or measure that you raise, but to take measures that will strengthen the program and enhance its long-term solvency without slashing benefits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure -- because they can happen within the same framework without -- but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that taking measures to increase and strengthen the program -- I mean, increase its solvency and strengthen the program is a way of dealing with our short-term deficit issues because they\xe2\x80\x99re not related. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no suggestion that the changes in Social Security would actually solve the 75-year Social Security problem, so essentially you would just be maybe taking a bite out of it without really --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody is under any illusion that even a significant deficit reduction package or one that includes some of these other things would solve all problems for all times.\xc2\xa0 But it is our obligation to take measures to strengthen and increase and lengthen the solvency of these programs that have been the foundation of economic security for America\xe2\x80\x99s senior citizens -- Medicare and Social Security.\xc2\xa0 I mean, any measure we took -- look, the significant reforms that Ronald Reagan and Tip O\xe2\x80\x99Neill put into -- made law in the 1980s extended Social Security\xe2\x80\x99s solvency and strengthened it for a very long time -- when that Reagan-O\xe2\x80\x99Neill compromise, by the way, was a balanced compromise that included dealing with revenues and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that was all within Social Security, and this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the point you\xe2\x80\x99re making.\xc2\xa0 The fact that that was all within Social Security is true and we can do Social Security entirely separate or we can do it as part of this, but it is still solving a separate problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any plans of traveling outside of Washington while this issue is still unresolved?\xc2\xa0 Is he sort of committed to staying here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I think he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to meet every day until this is done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect him to be going and taking his case out to the public across the country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about his travel schedule, but he is committed to meeting every day with these leaders until this is done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On weekends as well?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 They have regular meetings; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Secretary Geithner has briefed the President on the details of the circumstance that would present itself on August 3rd.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about that.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure -- again, I would refer you to the Treasury Department about how those decisions would be made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President yesterday, he said that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see more from the business community in terms of lobbying to get a deal done and to sound some of the alarms for if the debt ceiling is not raised August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 Can you specify some of the actions he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see and whether or not the letter that was sent today from some 470 CEOs -- was that enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s welcome.\xc2\xa0 You cited this -- I was going to mention this to you as obviously not something we organized -- I believe the Chamber did -- but a letter from hundreds of business leaders that says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe it is vitally important for the U.S. government to make good on its financial obligations and to put its fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 First, it is critical that the United States government not default in any way on its fiscal obligations.\xc2\xa0 A great nation, like a great company, has to be relied upon to pay its debts when they become due.\xc2\xa0 This is a Main Street, not a Wall Street, issue.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe debt ceiling trigger\xe2\x80\x9d -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just skipping around here to relevant points -- \xe2\x80\x9cThe debt ceiling trigger does offer a needed catalyst for serious negotiations on budget discipline, but avoiding even a technical default is essential.\xc2\xa0 This is a risk our country must not take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cSecond, our political leaders must agree to a plan to substantially reduce our long-term budget deficits with a goal of at least stabilizing our nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt as a percentage of GDP, which will entail difficult choices.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said it better.\xc2\xa0 And we agree.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there more, though, beyond --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- we think everyone has a stake in this.\xc2\xa0 It can seem arcane, understandably, when I and others stand up and talk about debt-to-GDP ratios and the need to not default on our obligations and to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I honestly -- what is the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 I think for most Americans, it sounds like gobbledygook.\xc2\xa0 What they want is for the economy to be strong, for jobs to be created, and for Washington to work.\xc2\xa0 And with that as our goal -- with those three objectives as our goal, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious what we have to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is having lunch with two of the CEOs who signed that letter.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be asking them to do more?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a printed or written agenda.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that because this is an issue that so many businesses are worried about, understandably, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will come up.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who is he having lunch with?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we put this out to or we gave it to the pool here, but he is having, as he has done throughout his administration, he will have lunch, or is having lunch now with four business leaders to discuss ideas to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 They will specifically discuss the importance of working with the private sector to promote job training efforts, including ways that companies have been partnering with high educational institutions to develop curriculum and programs that ensure graduates will have the appropriate background and skills to succeed and get hired within the companies.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The business leaders in attendance are Clarence Otis of Darden Restaurants, Scott Davis of UPS, Sam Palmisano of IBM, and Matt Rose of BNSF.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no agenda?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a broad outline of one topic they will likely talk about.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want -- just because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk about this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about those other issues because those other issues are quite clearly of concern and in the news right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Treasury Secretary did say this morning that in its push not only for the debt ceiling but for the big deficit-cutting package the administration could use some support.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House doing anything to rally those less vocal, less ideological elements of the public to get involved?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we welcome the letter that was -- I think Julianna said 470 business leaders --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Chamber you said organized that.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House doing anything to gin up some --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As the President said, we have conversations with business leaders all the time.\xc2\xa0 He does; others do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure this has been an issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not in some sort of organized effort that I know of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is pushing on an open door, if you will.\xc2\xa0 These are issues that they are very concerned about for obvious reasons.\xc2\xa0 And as the letter makes clear, while they are concerned about it for obvious reasons, it is not a concern limited just to business and it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It obviously affects every American who has to worry about interest rates, mortgage payments, credit card payments, worries about his or her job.\xc2\xa0 The impact of a default would be catastrophic for so many people around the country and the globe that we simply cannot even entertain the possibility that it might happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CBS interview is on their website, so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read a little bit from it just to clarify this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- if asked -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s spent a lot of time taking questions lately, so if asked I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll make the point, as he did today, we\xe2\x80\x99re not spending a lot of time warning about what would happen if we defaulted, because we do not believe we will default.\xc2\xa0 We accept what leaders of Congress have said about the impermissibility of allowing the United States to default on its obligations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we believe we will get there by hook or by crook through this process, and we will -- Congress will vote as necessary, Democrats and Republicans, because this is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s an American problem, and we will take action necessary to deal with it, and take advantage, hopefully, in the biggest possible way, of the opportunity presented here to achieve something significant.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And remember that way back when, when this process began, the linkage between raising the debt ceiling and significant deficit reduction was one that was put forward by Republicans because they believed it was the primary objective.\xc2\xa0 The number one item on their agenda list when it came to domestic policy, economic policy, probably all policy was to deal with cutting spending, reducing our deficit, reducing our long-term debt problem.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that we accept the challenge and we are willing to compromise to get there.\xc2\xa0 And he still believes, even at this late date, that the biggest possible deal is the best way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what his reaction was when the Majority Whip Cantor -- Majority Leader Cantor said that he considered it in terms of who\xe2\x80\x99s making concessions, that their concession in return for you giving spending cuts is to allow a vote on the debt limit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one version of the question that somebody in the front row asked, which is that that\xe2\x80\x99s -- this is not the President\xe2\x80\x99s problem --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to know what his reaction was, though.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he was asked about this in the interview, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very much what I just said, which is, wait a second, this is an American problem.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a Democratic problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a Republican problem, it\xe2\x80\x99s not this President\xe2\x80\x99s problem.\xc2\xa0 In fact, as I said, this is not a vote on new spending.\xc2\xa0 This is a vote to fulfill the obligations made by previous Congresses under a previous President by and large, okay?\xc2\xa0 When President Clinton left office, there were surpluses.\xc2\xa0 Everyone agrees, right?\xc2\xa0 I know that there -- people like to argue over absolutely settled facts, but I think we can all agree that there were budget surpluses when Bill Clinton left office -- \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the eye could see\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase commonly used.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By the time President Obama was sworn into office eight years later, there was the largest debt and largest deficits in history.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 And these are -- as the President has said, these are cars that have already been purchased and vacations that have already been taken, and now it\xe2\x80\x99s time to pay the bills.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did not say, however, when asked about this, oh, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my responsibility; it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility because they ran up the bills.\xc2\xa0 They voted and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for two wars; they voted and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for substantial tax cuts, including tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for them; a Medicare prescription drug program that they voted for, including every leader in that room from the Republican Party -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These are the obligations that we have to now pay.\xc2\xa0 So -- but you know what the President said?\xc2\xa0 He goes, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility, too.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility, too.\xc2\xa0 I will work with Congress because we have to do this as a nation; it\xe2\x80\x99s an American challenge, and we do it together.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did he say something to them yesterday, in the meeting they had in the afternoon in response --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware.\xc2\xa0 I know the -- well, on different -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to read out the dialogue from the meetings.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything of that nature that he said.\xc2\xa0 Because what I -- when I was just channeling him, with a little filigree of my own, the -- that was in response to some of the statements made this morning. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the President has reconvened these talks under his own auspices, has any progress been made?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there has, in the sense that, as I was saying I think in answer to Laura\xe2\x80\x99s question or somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s questions, the participants in these meetings haven\xe2\x80\x99t been engaged, all of them, in the detailed discussions that were led by the Vice President or, obviously with the exception of the Speaker and the President, the conversations that the Speaker and the President had. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there had been progress in that the -- more people now are aware of what the playing field looks like, where the compromises can be found, and what it takes to build upon a smaller package to the biggest possible package, and the hard choices that getting from small to big require.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like anything further agreed to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s progress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If this were easy, we\xe2\x80\x99d be done and having happy hour at 4:00 p.m. today, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Really quickly, let me ask you from the other direction -- the clear impression from this end of the looking glass is that the positions have hardened.\xc2\xa0 Is that wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there has been some hardening of positions, restating of absolutist positions.\xc2\xa0 We have encountered that along the way.\xc2\xa0 But our only counsel at this point in response to that is that time is running out, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 We need to put that absolutism aside, leave it at the door, and get to the hard work of reaching an agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say this had been moved today to the Roosevelt Room?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, everybody here -- or everybody there, rather, in those rooms is an elected official who\xe2\x80\x99s been around politics for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And I think most participants have pretty thick skin, which is not to say it helps, but I think everybody can get over it pretty quickly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any problem with federal dollars being sent to a counseling clinic that engages in the controversial therapy of trying to cure people of being gay?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say obviously that this is -- at a personal level we -- our prayers and sympathies are with the Karzai family during this difficult time.\xc2\xa0 The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the murder of President Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s half-brother in Kandahar. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We obviously -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who is responsible.\xc2\xa0 There have been some claims and we will certainly work with the Afghan authorities on that, but right now I think the moment here is one -- is a personal one, and we express our condolences and condemn the murder.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some questions on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Last week the Ninth Circuit issued an order barring the government from enforcing this law.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President heard the news last week.\xc2\xa0 Is he supportive of the decision?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll note that we\xe2\x80\x99ve said today that -- and the Secretary of State has said this -- that President Assad has lost his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 And the issue here is a matter of factual analysis, and that is that President Assad had an opportunity to lead this transition.\xc2\xa0 And we have always said he should lead or leave.\xc2\xa0 He had that opportunity and he passed it up. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, not because he\xe2\x80\x99s lost -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter nearly as much that he\xe2\x80\x99s lost legitimacy in our eyes.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter of analysis that he\xe2\x80\x99s lost legitimacy in the eyes of the Syrian people who are increasingly demanding change.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s really a growing consensus among the Syrian people that this transition needs to take place and that President Assad is not going to lead it.\xc2\xa0 The Syrian people should be able to decide their own future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given the 1,400-plus deaths in Syria that have occurred against civilians, how is this different from Libya?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I could review the facts for you.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, there was an imminent threat of a massacre.\xc2\xa0 There was a broad-based, multinational coalition that was not just the United Nations -- or NATO rather, but through the United Nations Security Council Resolution, included NATO action as well as coalition participation by nations in the region and, again, the opportunity to work in a multinational way to forestall a massacre against the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 And as we have said throughout the unrest that has affected the region -- North Africa and the Middle East -- every country and every circumstance is different.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one more.\xc2\xa0 I always do one more.\xc2\xa0 Lester, for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak out in support of Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s giving illegal aliens in-state tuition at colleges and universities?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
