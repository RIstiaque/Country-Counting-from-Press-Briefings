PDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a little bumpy.\xc2\xa0 I just want to -- just a couple of quick notes, some scheduling updates.\xc2\xa0 When we land the President goes to -- is going to go to the Westin hotel; that\xe2\x80\x99s our overnight RON.\xc2\xa0 But about 3:30 p.m. will meet with Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, for about 45 minutes.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting that the President was interested in having.\xc2\xa0 I think they last met in -- I\'ll double-check this -- but I think they last met along the trail of the 2008 campaign.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s eager to talk to him about the economy, innovation in technology, education.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99ll do that and go back to the -- be at the hotel for a little bit.\xc2\xa0 We have one quick stop on the way to the DNC fundraiser.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a -- at Steve Westly\xe2\x80\x99s house, the former state treasurer of California, there is a quick photo line on behalf of Kamala Harris, who is running for attorney general.\xc2\xa0 The President will not make remarks at that event.\xc2\xa0 And then we go to the DNC dinner, which we are bringing the print pool in for.\xc2\xa0 So just wanted to add the Jobs meeting onto the schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a readout?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make remarks at the Kamala Harris?\xc2\xa0 Is that print only?\xc2\xa0 Or nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No one\xe2\x80\x99s going in.\xc2\xa0 No remarks at that one.\xc2\xa0 We will have a readout of the Jobs event, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say where the Jobs meeting is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s at the hotel, it\xe2\x80\x99s at the Westin.\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One follow-up from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Have you heard back from the NSC about rare earth --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not yet.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll double-check.\xc2\xa0 I had not heard back this morning, but I\'ll double-check as soon as we land.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard anything.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what the President might or might not say specifically on the foreclosure issue at tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Nevada event, given that foreclosures are such a big problem in Nevada?\xc2\xa0 Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll address the foreclosure mess specifically in his remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The remarks I had seen didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it in there, but I will double-check.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think -- what the administration has been working on over the past several weeks through FHA, HUD, Treasury and other agencies is to ensure that servicers are indeed following the law and ensuring that if they\xe2\x80\x99re not following the law that they\xe2\x80\x99re held accountable for failure to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\'ll check and see if that\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned in the remarks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is Harry Reid symbolically for you guys?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is obviously the most important one, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think Senator Reid is somebody who has obviously done a lot to ensure our success in the United States Senate; was a supporter, somebody who urged the President to run very early.\xc2\xa0 So obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of respect for what he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to do over the past several years.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important race.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- announcing that there are going to be some campaign stops the last week.\xc2\xa0 Did you guys have any announcements on campaign stops the last week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know Connecticut is out there.\xc2\xa0 Let me double-check and see if they\xe2\x80\x99ve advised --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Illinois, Ohio --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- if they\xe2\x80\x99ve advised that.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if they --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Illinois, Connecticut.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on -- they had not locked it in as of the last time I talked to them.\xc2\xa0 So let me double-check.\xc2\xa0 They sent it out?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How has the President felt about the reception he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten so far on this trip?\xc2\xa0 Has he said anything to you about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well -- no, I mean, look, I think you could see the crowd -- look, talking to some of the guys that have been on the road consistently for the last several weeks, I think the energy in Portland and Seattle was as energetic as they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen crowds in many weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, they were loud, excited, fired up.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think the reception alone in Seattle, you could see lots of people along the streets waving and holding up signs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President did an event today on women in the economy.\xc2\xa0 How important are women going to be on November 2nd?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, they are -- they\xe2\x80\x99re certainly -- they\xe2\x80\x99re important.\xc2\xa0 Look, every vote is important.\xc2\xa0 We have -- traditionally, Democrats have enjoyed strong support among women and I think if you look at certainly what this administration has been able to do, starting with one of the first things we passed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been something that the President -- issues that the President has been focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ll do well on Election Day.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some are defecting to Republicans, though.\xc2\xa0 Some are saying they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of -- because they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming more of a work force staple, that the economy is affecting them and they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming disheartened and they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of going over to the Republican side.\xc2\xa0 How do you guys feel about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of frustrated voters, men and women.\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t doubt there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of frustration, as we always see with the pace of where we are in this economy.\xc2\xa0 But I think if you look -- go back and listen to what the President says at these rallies.\xc2\xa0 Are you going to be with the folks that have got us -- that got us into this mess and have done virtually nothing to help get us out, or are you going to support the guys that have been working hard to get the economy turned around again?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the truth is that\'s not just a campaign speech; that\'s the reality of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the past two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much trimming back of expectations will the President have to do if Republicans gain a lot of seats November 2nd, or even if they take over the House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Trimming back expectations?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of what you want to get done for the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President, over the course of the past several weeks -- look, I think the President -- what you heard the President talk about today in the backyard event, whether it is leading the way on creating a clean energy economy, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s doing something serious about our fiscal picture -- our deficits and our debt -- look, those are all problems that we\'re going to have to tackle.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegardless of the outcome of the election, voters are going to want Democrats and Republicans to work constructively to solve those problems.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not always happened in the past two years, but that\'s what the American people are going to demand.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, the only way we\'re going to make progress on them is to have two parties working to solve some very complex issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what we\'ll see after Election Day as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Harry Reid, are you surprised that the race is so close at this point?\xc2\xa0 Sharron Angle is someone who\xe2\x80\x99s made some controversial remarks about Social Security and other things.\xc2\xa0 Are you surprised that the Majority Leader is neck and neck with her at this stage in the race?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the reason that Senator Reid enjoys a lead in the polls is because of exactly what you talked about.\xc2\xa0 I think people are going to have to -- do you want somebody that questions whether or not their Social Security should exist?\xc2\xa0 Do you -- look at the number of controversial comments that get made about -- just recently, about how students look.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI do think people make judgments about whether somebody has the judgment and the wherewithal to serve and represent an entire state in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I think on Election Day, they\xe2\x80\x99ll register their opinion and make up their mind on behalf of sending Harry Reid back as somebody who works hard for constituents in that state, who\xe2\x80\x99s working hard to turn the economy around in a place that\'s been very hard-hit, as you mentioned, by housing and foreclosures -- rather than somebody who seems to be well out of the mainstream of where voters are in the state of Nevada.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So her comments about Hispanics should be an issue for voters, you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They are among some of the stranger comments that we\'ve heard in an otherwise strange election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on this special interest spending.\xc2\xa0 Washington, California, Nevada, some of the states where we\'re seeing the most money spent on these kinds of ads -- is the President going to change his message or reference that at all in his remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He certainly mentioned it in Seattle.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting today when you look at -- I think you saw the money figures that came out for the national parties.\xc2\xa0 The RNC is down $10 million behind I think where the Democratic National Committee is.\xc2\xa0 And normally that would be a pretty big story, and I think it says a lot certainly about the RNC, but it also shows you that even with that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got these outside groups that are spending tens or hundreds of millions of dollars cumulatively, without even knowing who they are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got people -- I saw a report today -- people that are giving $10 million just as an individual to get involved in these secret groups that otherwise wouldn\'t tell you who their names were.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think it is pertinent and I think you see in -- if you look at the NBC polling, people are concerned about the agenda of those people that come in, write big checks to influence elections in states they don\'t live in, wondering what are they looking for in return, and what are the people that they\xe2\x80\x99re ultimately going to send to Washington going to do on behalf of an agenda that is likely to be unknown to the voters when they cast their votes but I have no doubt that will be told to those who get sent to Washington what they needed to do and say in order to make the investment worth their while.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, then you\xe2\x80\x99d know who those donors were because they wouldn\'t be so ashamed to tell you what their names were.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President will certainly mention it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a case in Patty Murray\xe2\x80\x99s race in Washington and certainly so in a fairly expensive state to advertise in like California.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99d better sit down before we land.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll do a -- I\'ll have a readout of the Jobs meeting afterwards.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:09 P.M.
