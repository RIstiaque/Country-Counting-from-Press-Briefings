Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:46 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\'s nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Jim, I don\'t have anything to say at the top, so if you want to get us going with some questions, I\'ll let you do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wow.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just in the name of efficiency here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few questions on immigration.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the White House is open to the idea of combining, or at least parallel-tracking the supplemental request that you put out there and efforts in Congress to change or at least to adjust the law to accommodate some of the demands that members want to expedite the process.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I think we\'ve been pretty clear about what we would like to see.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see, first and foremost, Congress take action on the specific proposal that we\'ve put forward to ensure that our administration has the necessary resources to deal with the spike in apprehensions that we\'ve seen along the southwest border.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear about itemizing about what specifically that money would be used to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 This would include everything from ensuring that public health precautions are in place to adding additional surveillance resources at the border to assist Border Patrol agents as they do their important work.</p>\n<p>So we\'ve laid out a comprehensive, detailed request.\xc2\xa0 The request that we\'ve put forward answers a lot of the questions and concerns that have been raised even by Republican members of Congress who have been talking publicly about this issue.\xc2\xa0 So we would anticipate and certainly even expect bipartisan support for this proposal.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s critical is that Congress act quickly to pass it.\xc2\xa0 It has been out there in the public now for more than 10 days, this detailed proposal.\xc2\xa0 A week before that, we announced our intention to submit this proposal.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s already been ample opportunity for Congress to take action and we want to encourage them to move forward with some sense of urgency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is do you want a clean supplemental, strictly on the spending, and have the policy issues, the authorities, the greater authorities that you want for the Homeland Security Secretary -- do you want those separately?\xc2\xa0 Or do you have any issue with the two being combined?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'re right, the second thing that we have asked for is we\'ve asked for Congress to give greater authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security so that he can exercise greater discretion in enforcing the law more efficiently.</p>\n<p>In terms of the legislative machinations of all of this, we\'re going to have to rely on Congress to do their business in the way that they feel is most appropriate.\xc2\xa0 What we would like to see is prompt action on both of these things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve addressed this before, but I wanted to get a little bit more clarity on it.\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday that the President wants all individuals crossing the border to get the due process to which they are entitled.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if does treating Central American individuals, minors who cross the border the same way that Mexican border crossers are treated now -- in other words, a review or an interview with a border official and then a determination as to whether they should be returned or whether they somehow qualify for the immigration system -- is that adequate due process for a Central American minor for which that process does not exist?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to shed a whole lot more light on the details here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty specific about the principles that are at stake.\xc2\xa0 As it relates to this surge of individuals that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Central America, we want to, A, ensure that their basic humanitarian needs are met.\xc2\xa0 That is a requirement that is in line with the law; it is in line with the values of this country, particularly when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about children.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Second, we do believe that individuals from Central America who are apprehended along the southwest border are entitled to due process.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is what the current 2008 law requires and that is a principle that this administration continues to support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What we would like to see change -- and this goes to the third principle -- is we would like the Secretary of Homeland Security to be given additional authority so that he can use his discretion about how to more efficiently enforce the law.\xc2\xa0 For example, after an individual has gone through the removal proceedings and an immigration judge has concluded that they do not have a legitimate claim for humanitarian relief, we would like the Secretary of Homeland Security to have the authority to use his discretion, in some cases, to act quickly to remove those individuals back to their home country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s different than what\xe2\x80\x99s available for a Mexican border crosser where there\xe2\x80\x99s -- at the very beginning of the process there\xe2\x80\x99s this sieve, at which point they get separated -- either put into the immigration system or returned.\xc2\xa0 Is that the same kind of -- would you have that same application for a Central American?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that this is more complicated when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about somebody from Central America is purely -- well, is in part a matter of logistics, that the southwestern border with the United States is adjacent to Mexico throughout.\xc2\xa0 So if it\xe2\x80\x99s an individual from Mexico, you\xe2\x80\x99re able to in some cases prevent them from entering and they\xe2\x80\x99re not sort of caught in this no-man\xe2\x80\x99s land that an individual from Central America might be, because if they\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed into this border -- or they\xe2\x80\x99re not apprehended and taken into custody by Border Patrol officials, they\xe2\x80\x99re not in their home country if they\xe2\x80\x99re on the other side of the border.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s this logistical complication that we\xe2\x80\x99re working through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, based on some of the interviews and comments I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the press from those who authored this 2008 law, this is a consequence that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they fully intended.\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to work through this process in a way that is in keeping with the values of this country, but just as importantly, is in keeping with the laws of this country.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to and are committed to enforcing that law.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we would like is additional authority to be given to the Secretary of Homeland Security so we can enforce that law more efficiently.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on.\xc2\xa0 And that may require, as we discussed a little bit yesterday, either the passage of a new law to give him that greater authority, or a change to the old law be passed by the Congress.\xc2\xa0 Either way, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear about the principles that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Congress ultimately arrive at.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have you had an opportunity since yesterday to review the Cornyn-Cuellar proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that that bill has not yet been filed.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the U.S. government flew some Honduran immigrants yesterday back on a charter flight to Honduras.\xc2\xa0 Is that a flight that the President authorized himself?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, the flight that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to was a flight that was operated by the Department of Homeland Security in their capacity as a law enforcement agency, that they were enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 So that is a decision that was made by that law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p>I would point out, though, that that is a reflection of the effort that this administration has made to increase the resources that are used to deal with this surge that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent days.\xc2\xa0 That flight was composed of -- the people who were on that flight were individuals who had attempted to enter this country without documentation and were traveling with a minor, so these were so-called family units.\xc2\xa0 And they had been apprehended at the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They had been detained at the Artesia facility in New Mexico that we opened up a just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And it is a reflection in part of this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to prioritize the cases of recent border crossers, and that should be a clear signal, again, to individuals who are contemplating making the dangerous journey, or putting their children in the hands of a criminal to make the dangerous journey from Central America to the United States, that if apprehended at the border, they will be -- they\'re entitled to due process, but they will not be welcomed to this country with open arms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that it was DHS.\xc2\xa0 But is the White House or the President involved at all in authorizing that flight and/or future flights like it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is responsible for setting out sort of the topline policy for -- adding additional resources within his capacity as the head of the executive branch to address some of these problems.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly been working closely with the Secretary of Homeland Security to surge those resources to open these facilities.\xc2\xa0 He directed the FEMA Director to step in and play a role in coordinating among DHS, DOD and HHS, who are the agencies involved in this broader effort.\xc2\xa0 So there is a role for the President to play in terms of making decisions about where to devote our resources and how those resources should be deployed to address this specific problem.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes specifically to enforcing the law, that\'s the responsibility of law enforcement officials, and that flight reflects their commitment to carrying out their duties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to see further flights like this coming up?\xc2\xa0 And will any of them have unaccompanied minors without the family units that were characteristic of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s flight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For those kinds of questions, because these flights are carried out by DHS through their law enforcement capacity, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to direct your questions along those lines to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And one separate issue.\xc2\xa0 Can you discuss the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts right now to encourage European partners to go further on sanctions against Russia with regard to Ukraine? Was there a meeting yesterday here at the White House with the EU ambassadors about that?\xc2\xa0 Any detail you can give about those efforts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a specific -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to read you in on specific meetings.\xc2\xa0 But over the last several weeks you have seen readout calls between -- or the readouts of calls between the President of the United States and a number of our allies in Western Europe.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to hear that there are regular communications between senior administration officials here at the White House and diplomats and other foreign leaders that happen to be in this country.\xc2\xa0 We have been working in very close coordination with our allies to impose costs on Russia for their destabilizing actions along the border with Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We have also taken specific steps to isolate Russia, and there are a variety of measures that indicate those steps have had an impact, a negative impact on the Russian economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have signaled pretty clearly that additional steps may be imposed if Russia doesn\'t take the kinds of steps that we have asked them to take.\xc2\xa0 Those steps include things like securing the border to ensure that heavy weapons and materiel can\'t be transferred from the Russian side into the hands of pro-Russian separatists.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve asked President Putin to coordinate with the OSCE in terms of a border-monitoring mechanism.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also asked the Russians to support a road map for talks under the OSCE-mediated contact group.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve asked President Putin to use the influence that he has with Russian separatists to encourage them to lay down their weapons and abide by a cease-fire agreement, and allow this contact group to negotiate the kind of settlement that would deescalate the conflict that we\'ve seen in that country.</p>\n<p>What we are primarily concerned about is the long-term impact that all of this is having on Ukraine, that ultimately we would like Ukraine to be a stable, peaceful, democratic country. And the more that Russia plays a destabilizing influence on Ukraine, it makes it harder for them to be secure both politically and economically.\xc2\xa0 And the longer that this goes on, the more difficult it will be for us to put Ukraine on the stable, sound footing both politically and economically that we would like to see them be on.</p>\n<p>Viqueira.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on immigration.\xc2\xa0 These families that were flown from Artesia back to Central America, did they ever leave American supervision or detention of American authorities?\xc2\xa0 And where do they get an opportunity to make their case that they may or may not deserve asylum?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I would encourage you to ask these specific questions about these individual cases to DHS.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not in a position to talk about individual cases from here.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, the administration has made clear that we believe those individuals from Central America who are detained along the southwest border are entitled to due process.\xc2\xa0 And for the specific details about how these individuals were treated while they were in U.S. custody --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You assume that they did receive a fair hearing on --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\'m suggesting is that for detailed questions about the handling of individual cases you should check with DHS.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly used the verb \xe2\x80\x9cefficiently\xe2\x80\x9d -- it is a verb, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Adverb.\xc2\xa0 Adverb.\xc2\xa0 Somewhere my 6th grade English teacher is beaming with pride.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly used that adverb \xe2\x80\x9cefficiently\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the powers that you want the DHS Secretary to have.\xc2\xa0 How efficient?\xc2\xa0 What is the goal?\xc2\xa0 What is the timeframe that you want these cases dealt with?\xc2\xa0 Within the 72 hours that the Border Patrol can have them before they\xe2\x80\x99re released from detention under any circumstances?\xc2\xa0 What is the goal in terms of the timeframe?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set a specific benchmark in terms of what we would like to see in terms of that timing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a key question, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is a key question.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear at this point and where I think you and I can find some agreement about this is that currently, because this surge has contributed to a backlog in the system, the time that all of this takes is too long.\xc2\xa0 In many cases, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got just a handful of judges that are dealing with the thousands and thousands of cases of individuals who have been apprehended at the border.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one place where there\xe2\x80\x99s a bottleneck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you have repeatedly said that the administration is prioritizing new arrivals, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s true.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the backlog is less relevant here.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, not necessarily, because, again, as has been widely reported, even on a daily basis there\xe2\x80\x99s been a spike in the number of individuals who have been apprehended along the border and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough resources in terms of our immigration court system to deal with all of them.\xc2\xa0 So the President has taken some steps to try to deal with that based on existing resources.\xc2\xa0 There are things that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing related to putting television cameras so that judges can participate in court proceedings remotely.</p>\n<p>But what we\xe2\x80\x99d really like to see Congress do is give the administration additional resources so that we can hire some additional judges, we can hire some additional prosecutors that could work for ICE, and speed up the processing of these removal cases, removal proceedings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are 10 legislative days before Congress leaves, to return on September 8th, I believe the date is.\xc2\xa0 This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 So what is plan B here for you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, what we have seen is that when Congress wants to do something they can act pretty quickly to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And based on the public comments of both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that this is a priority, a bipartisan priority -- that is, dealing with this problem.\xc2\xa0 So we are going to continue to be in a position where we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging Congress to take the kind of urgent action that they themselves acknowledge as necessary to deal with this situation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What role has the United States played in this cease-fire with Gaza, which many think was half-baked, rushed and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long?\xc2\xa0 And even Hamas itself -- it said they were never consulted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same pessimism about the cease-fire agreement that you\xe2\x80\x99re exhibiting.\xc2\xa0 In a very compressed time period, we saw the Egyptians announce a proposal for a cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 Within just a few hours, the Israeli government signaled an openness to agreeing to that cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 Promptly after that we saw a vote among the Israeli cabinet to abide by that cease-fire agreement.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, through that period of time, Hamas and other groups that are launching rockets from Gaza into Israel have continued that activity.</p>\n<p>As we have said many times, the firing of rockets from Gaza at innocent civilians in Israel is completely unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And Israel -- and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are certainly entitled to take the kinds of actions that are necessary to keep their citizens safe. What we would like to see is we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Hamas accept the terms of the cease-fire agreement that were floated by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 That would be a way for us to quickly deescalate the situation and restore some measure of calm to the area, and allow for a broader discussion into the negotiations about trying to bring some enduring sense of calm to that region of the world.</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work that remains to be done.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that the Egyptians, in a very compressed time period, put forward this specific proposal and had this proposal considered and accepted by the Israelis I think is an important step.\xc2\xa0 What we need to see now is we need to see Hamas and some of the other groups that are operating in the area abide by this common-sense cease-fire agreement that was put forward by the Egyptians.</p>\n<p>Again, this is in line with the cease-fire agreement that both sides agreed to just in November of 2012.\xc2\xa0 So there certainly is a precedent for this kind of proposal having a positive impact on relations between the two countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United States reaching out to other countries that probably have better leeway, better relations with Hamas than Egypt at this time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the United States has been in touch with a variety of countries in the region, some of whom do have some influence with Hamas and some of the other groups that are operating there.\xc2\xa0 I can just give you a topline rundown.\xc2\xa0 I mean, as you know, the President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu at the end of last week.\xc2\xa0 The Special Coordinator at the White House for the Middle East, Phil Gordon, met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Ramallah when he was in the region last week.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the last week or so, Secretary Kerry has spoken at least four times with Prime Minister Netanyahu and he\xe2\x80\x99s also spoken on the phone a couple of times with his Egyptian counterpart.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of that time, he\xe2\x80\x99s also spoken with the Foreign Minister of Qatar, as well as the foreign ministers from Jordan and Turkey.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a large number of interested parties here, and the United States has been working to use our influence to mobilize the international community and our partners in that area to encourage, even compel Hamas to abide by the cease-fire agreement that was floated by the Egyptians and agreed to by the Israelis.</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to share your optimism, Josh, but as you know if Iron Dome doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work just once, there is a possibility that the Israeli troops may, in fact, go into Gaza.\xc2\xa0 The region is somehow, someway, spiraling out of control.\xc2\xa0 Might it be time for the President himself to pull together a summit of international world leaders in person, like Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande, Merkel, even Putin, for example, to form a coalition of the willing, if you will, to address this issue to find a real concrete solution to stop the violence and to appeal to the leadership in the region before it really becomes too late?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a willingness on the part of the President and Secretary Kerry to roll up their sleeves and engage world leaders around the globe in the effort to try to bring about a cease-fire between Israel and those groups in Hamas that are launching rockets.\xc2\xa0 For this kind of violence to persist is not in the interest of either the Palestinian people or the Israeli people.\xc2\xa0 And what we need to see is we need to see the two sides come together around a cease-fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, fortunately, the Israelis have already agreed to it.\xc2\xa0 We just need to see Hamas stop firing rockets and restore some calm to the area.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may, Josh, just one second -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the highest-level leaders -- the Presidents, the Prime Ministers, including President Putin, who have influence in this region, always had influence in this region, to really physically come together to promote that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, these conversations are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And in a modern, 21st century world, telephone communication and other electronic communication can be effective.\xc2\xa0 But if the President believes that a summit is necessary and would make a difference in terms of enhancing this conversation, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the President wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to propose such a meeting, or look for the opportunity to have a meeting or in-person discussion like this on the sidelines of some other international meeting.</p>\n<p>But suffice it to say this administration, from the President on down, is deeply engaged with our allies, with the Israelis and Palestinians, and with other partners in the region to try to bring about the kind of cease-fire agreement that would at least provide greater protection for the innocent civilians who are currently caught in the crossfire.</p>\n<p>Christie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back on the highway bill for a moment. The President was somewhat critical of House Republicans today, but, in fact, they\'re passing something today that the White House supports.\xc2\xa0 That\'s somewhat rare.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Breaking news.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Breaking news.\xc2\xa0 And I wondered if you could analyze a little bit why you think -- are you all surprised at all that that\'s around highway construction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, right, I mean, is this -- why is this happening on highway construction?\xc2\xa0 And do you think it bodes well for other things that you consider emergency measures?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the stakes around the Highway Trust Fund are high.\xc2\xa0 If the Highway Trust Fund were to expire, as I mentioned a little bit yesterday, the potential economic consequences are pretty dire.\xc2\xa0 We would see up to 700,000 jobs put at risk.\xc2\xa0 It certainly would put at risk a number of ongoing infrastructure projects that have an important economic impact in communities all across the country.</p>\n<p>So I think there is -- I think at least part of this bipartisan common ground, that is, as you point out, very rare, is a recognition of the fact that this is a genuine priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Historically funding for transportation projects and other infrastructure projects has not gotten mired in partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of that lately, unfortunately.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly encouraged that even a short-term measure like the one that Congressman Camp has put forward would avert the terrible economic consequences that come with the expiration of the Highway Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, what has not changed, however, as you heard the President articulate earlier today, is this administration\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy for a long-term renewal of the highway bill; that a longer-term investment in infrastructure would provide some certainty to the market, something Republicans themselves say is an important economic virtue.\xc2\xa0 It also would demonstrate the kind of commitment that would create many jobs in the short term, but also lay a foundation for long-term economic strength in this country.\xc2\xa0 So there are short-term benefits and long-term benefits.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a very common-sense proposal for extending the highway bill in a fiscally responsible way.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this involves closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well connected, and using the revenue from closing those loopholes to invest in the kind of infrastructure that everybody uses.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a common-sense proposal.\xc2\xa0 We hope it will get consideration in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to settle on a long-term proposal before we get to another deadline.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, on the issue of the long-term fix, is it fair for the President to lay so much of the responsibility for that on House Republicans when the Senate Democrats actually haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to arrive at something that works for them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that it is because I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a steady, consistent drumbeat from congressional Republicans opposing common-sense measures time and again that the President and other Democrats have advocated -- everything from increasing the minimum wage to laws that would guarantee fair pay -- or equal pay for equal work, measures that would reduce the cost of a college education.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that Republicans on Capitol Hill have blocked.\xc2\xa0 These are all things that should be common-sense measures that have traditionally earned bipartisan support that would do important, good things for the economy in a way that would benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So at the risk of sounding like a character on a police drama, Republicans have a little bit of a rap sheet when it comes to blocking common-sense proposals that would benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what the President was alluding to earlier today.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, Josh, the President today said that his message is just \xe2\x80\x9cdo something.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But the House did something.\xc2\xa0 They\'re about to do something.\xc2\xa0 They\'re about to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They\'re about to do something, which I guess is cause for if not celebration, at least some optimism, which is pretty rare in Washington, too.</p>\n<p>But look, if -- as we pointed out, we put out a statement of administration position just yesterday indicating that this administration is willing to support a proposal from House Republicans to extend the Highway Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a positive development.\xc2\xa0 I think that is prima facie evidence that this President is willing to work across the aisle to get things done that benefits the economy and middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re making good on that commitment.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Republicans do more of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious what the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking is in terms of why that opposition is occurring.\xc2\xa0 He has said in recent weeks, \xe2\x80\x9cthey don\'t do anything expect block me and call me names.\xc2\xa0 If I sponsored a bill declaring apple pie American, it might fall victim.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is it personal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe the presidential rhetoric is having an effect.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen congressional Republicans put forward --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there something personal going -- does he feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s something personal going on?\xc2\xa0 Is that what the President thinks, that they don\'t like him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President is acknowledging is that time and again, congressional Republicans have blocked common-sense proposals that would benefit middle-class families. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to explain why they would do that.\xc2\xa0 However, in this case, in this instance, we are pleased to see Republicans put forward the kind of proposal that, although it\xe2\x80\x99s a short-term proposal, is in line with one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s objectives, which is making sure that the Highway Trust Fund doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he taking it personally, I guess is the question that I\'m after here.\xc2\xa0 Or does he think that it is personal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think close observers of the President\xe2\x80\x99s speeches will note that the President is constantly talking about middle-class families and his efforts to represent their interests and to champion their interests in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>So I guess at the risk of saying it too directly, the President is not worried about himself.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s worried about middle-class families all across the country that are working harder and harder, and having a harder and harder time trying to make ends meet and do the kinds of things that we want middle-class families in this country to do, which is be able to buy a home, save for retirement, save to put their kids through college and ensure that hard work leads to a decent living.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Those are basic American values.\xc2\xa0 Those are the kinds of American values that have ensured the success of middle-class families for several generations now.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that that continues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is consistently advocating for policies that would benefit middle-class families. Unfortunately, Republicans time and time again have blocked those proposals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess you probably heard this criticism that it sounds a little \xe2\x80\x9cwoe is me\xe2\x80\x9d what the President is saying.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the criticism put quite that way, but I think what the President is focused on in these speeches is making it clear that there is no good reason that Republicans should continue their efforts to block specific pieces of legislation that are common-sense proposals that would benefit middle-class families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the only reason that Republicans can seem to put forward is the difficulty of the politics and their desire to remain in office and to appeal to an extreme right-wing base.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Republicans have put their political ambitions ahead of the interests of middle-class families so many times.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to give credit where it\xe2\x80\x99s due, and it appears that in this limited case, in terms of this short-term extension of the Highway Trust Fund, Republicans have changed course and are working in a common-sense way to at least in the short term extend the Highway Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good news.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop this administration from continuing to advocate for the kind of long-term highway reauthorization that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of the American economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on immigration, the immigration reform activist, Jose Antonio Vargas, was detained at the McAllen, Texas airport.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been in this country for a long time.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be deported?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, as I mentioned to Mike in response to his questions a little bit earlier, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about individual enforcement cases from the podium.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to his detention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no reaction to his detention.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to either check with CBP or DHS on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in Gaza, the Palestinian officials there are saying that 193 people have been killed, nearly 1,500 hurt. \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned that this is becoming a little lopsided?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House is concerned about any innocent civilians who are injured or killed.\xc2\xa0 There have been far too many innocent civilians who have lost their lives as a result of the violence and conflict in that region.\xc2\xa0 Our thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost loved ones in this conflict.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, the Israelis have agreed to the cease-fire proposal that was put forward by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 And what needs to stop is the rocket fire that\xe2\x80\x99s being launched by Hamas and other groups from Palestinian-held territories that is specifically targeting innocent civilians on the Israeli side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Picking up on that -- and I know I\xe2\x80\x99m giving this to you on the fly -- but Prime Minister Netanyahu has just given a brief statement in Israel.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one confirmed Israeli death as a result of a Hamas rocket fired this morning.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Netanyahu said, \xe2\x80\x9dHamas will pay a heavy price for the decision to continue this campaign.\xc2\xa0 When there is no cease-fire, our response is fire.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve proffered to solve it by cease-fire, but Hamas left us no other choice but to expand the operation and to cause them significant damage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Expanding the operation -- is the United States government comfortable with that Israeli response?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, let me just reiterate what I said to Jim, that our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been injured or who have had loved ones killed in this conflict. That applies to innocent Palestinian civilians that have been killed, and it certainly applies in the case of this individual Israeli citizen who was killed by Hamas rocket fire.\xc2\xa0 What we have seen is a conflict that has spiraled in a way that has had negative consequences for both sides.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 But before you came to the podium, you knew that, A, Hamas had not accepted the cease-fire and that one of the things the Israeli government was contemplating was expanding the scope of this operation in reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 So though these are new quotes, this is not exactly a revelation.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious to what degree, if at all, the United States government has any comment or is comfortable with the concept, now reality, of Israel expanding this military operation to punish Hamas for not accepting the Egyptian cease-fire proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the new reports of this death indicate is that this situation is not sustainable.\xc2\xa0 And Israeli political leaders have a right, even a responsibility, to protect the welfare of their citizens.\xc2\xa0 Israel has a right to defend itself. That is a right that we have articulated and defended on multiple occasions, and I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to do so now.\xc2\xa0 What we would ask the Israelis to do is to exhibit some concern for the safety and welfare of innocent civilians who are at risk of being caught in the cross-fire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Egypt has put forward a cease-fire proposal that Israel has accepted.\xc2\xa0 And what we would like to see now is Hamas and the other groups who are firing rockets from Palestinian-held territories to also accept the terms of that cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that we can ensure the safety or at least enhance the safety and well-being of civilians who are caught in the crossfire in that region.</p>\n<p>So all eyes now turn to Hamas and the groups in Palestinian-held territories who are firing rockets.\xc2\xa0 And the question for them is whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to abide by the cease-fire agreement that was put forward by the Egyptians.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the key right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say, on the question of sanctions and Russia, that through these conversations the United States government and its European allies are closer than they\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been to imposing this next level?\xc2\xa0 Is there a consensus on that? And is it a matter of timing and circumstance on behalf of what Russia does?\xc2\xa0 Or does there still need to be conversation about the question itself whether to take more steps?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the individual countries speak for themselves in terms of characterizing their own opinion.\xc2\xa0 I think as a general matter, our allies share the view with the United States that Russia has not done as much as we would like to see them do to contribute to a de-escalation of that conflict.</p>\n<p>Now, it would be -- as you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear me say, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly strategic for us to announce in advance possible timing or scope of a specific sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s being contemplated.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into that, at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m smart enough not to ask.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that conversations that are actively being held among the United States and our allies about the next step -- and each day that goes by that Russia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take the kind of very specific steps that I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out here many times Russia is at greater risk of facing the kinds of economic costs that have been imposed on them in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it sounded like you were trying to say this in response to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 The President would sign the House temporary Highway Trust Fund extension proposal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We put out a statement of administration position last night -- I missed it, too -- that indicated our support for that legislation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In supporting that legislation, is the President enabling Congress to kick the can again?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The reason that the administration and the President support the short-term proposal that was put forward by House Republicans is that it avoids what would be a terrible consequence of failing to renew the Highway Trust Fund.\xc2\xa0 Again, if we allowed the Highway Trust Fund to expire, it would put at risk about 700,000 American jobs.\xc2\xa0 It would put at risk any number of ongoing infrastructure and surface transportation projects all across the country.\xc2\xa0 That would have a terrible impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 It would even have a bad impact on the quality of life of people who live in the communities where these construction projects would be shut down.</p>\n<p>So that is a consequence that we were seeking to avoid.\xc2\xa0 The President made avoiding that consequence a priority.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re willing to support this Republican proposal that would avoid that consequence.\xc2\xa0 But it has not in any way diminished our ardent desire for a longer-term proposal that would give local governments, state governments and businesses all across the country the kind of certainty that comes with knowing that the Highway Trust Fund has been reauthorized for several years.\xc2\xa0 That has important short-term economic consequences in terms of creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also good for the economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And while we welcome the introduction, I guess later today, of the specific proposal, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage Congress, as the President did earlier today, to take the kind of long-term step that would be in the best interest of our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it difficult, though, to make that case if the crisis is averted by another temporary thing that picks up past the election?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s too difficult.\xc2\xa0 I was able to just do it there, so it can\xe2\x80\x99t be that hard if I could do it.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the supposed six-hour cease-fire.\xc2\xa0 Hamas said they rejected it because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t consulted by Egypt.\xc2\xa0 So is there any thinking or any encouragement by the U.S. to have Egypt revive that plan, maybe tweak it a bit so Hamas might have a different answer?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roger, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to characterize the conversations that may or may not have taken place between the Egyptians and Hamas.\xc2\xa0 But it is the firm belief of the administration that putting an end to this violence and putting in place a cease-fire is in the best interests of people on both sides of that border.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Israelis agree to that cease-fire, and we want Hamas and the other groups who are firing these rockets to do exactly the same thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Egyptian plan such that it should be revived or try at it again?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we still see this as a live option.\xc2\xa0 This is something that the Israelis have agreed to, the cabinet voted on it.\xc2\xa0 And we would like to see Hamas take steps that would put an end to the rocket fire and restore at least some sense of calm and bring some measure of safety to civilians who right now are caught in the cross-fire.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Kerry is either back here or on his way back here --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think they\'re in the air right now, actually.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to consult with the President and consult with Congress.\xc2\xa0 What is the next step?\xc2\xa0 Or is that what they\'re trying to figure out?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is the next step, which is that Secretary Kerry did have the opportunity over the last couple of days to engage in conversations with his Iranian counterpart, alongside the other members of P5-plus-1.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Kerry determined is that -- is essentially two things.\xc2\xa0 One is that the Iranians were engaged in a serious conversation and serious negotiations about resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry are, or are not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They are engaged in serious conversations, negotiations about the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, substantial gaps remain between the position articulated -- or I guess the concerns sought by the international community and the willingness of the Iranian regime to take those steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So given those substantial gaps, what Secretary Kerry is preparing to do is to consult with the President and with our partners in Congress to consider the variety of paths forward.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to speculate about which path will be taken at this point, but that will be the subject of a number of discussions in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s only two paths.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a variety, is there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to close off any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- an extension or not extension.\xc2\xa0 Or deal -- or deal.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we, I don\'t think, expect a deal, so it\xe2\x80\x99s either extension or not, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the discussions are determined to be.\xc2\xa0 I think an extension would be a broad characterization of the single path.\xc2\xa0 Ostensibly you could envision extensions of varying lengths --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a threshold question, whether to extend it or not.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a deadline.\xc2\xa0 As you said yesterday, a serious deadline.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that my counterparts in Congress would say that those details are really important.\xc2\xa0 So working through those details is part of that consultation to consider which path we\xe2\x80\x99ll move forward on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re making the case for an extension.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying on the one hand, the Iranians are engaged in serious talks about this, and on the other hand, serious gaps remain.\xc2\xa0 That sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re making the case for continuing the negotiations to narrow those gaps.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of important reasons why I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to say that from here.\xc2\xa0 The first is I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been the one that\'s been engaged in these conversations.\xc2\xa0 So it would be curious for somebody standing at a podium in Washington to decide the outcome of negotiations that are taking place in Vienna.</p>\n<p>The second is, the President ultimately is going to determine what he believes is in the best interests of American national security as we decide what our posture is going to be and in terms of these conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Congress, importantly, has something to say about this.\xc2\xa0 It is because of our close coordination with Congress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place the kinds of difficult sanctions that brought the Iranians to the table in the first place.\xc2\xa0 So they should have the opportunity to hear about how those conversations have been going in Vienna and have the opportunity to recommend what they think is the best way to move forward.</p>\n<p>So there are a lot of equities at stake here, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just not in a position, five days before the deadline, to say how those conversations will be resolved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if there is no deal and there is no extension, should the next step be to tighten sanctions, as Congress was trying to do before you started all this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that characterizes or at least underscores the variety of paths forward that are on the table at this point.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President and the Secretary of State are going to confer about, and it will be the substance of the consultations between senior administration officials and members of Congress in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to clarify something you said about the Israelis -- you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe would ask the Israelis to exhibit some concern for civilians caught in the cross-fire in Gaza.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Do you believe -- does the administration believe the Israelis have exhibited sufficient concern for civilians in Gaza?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to Monday-morning-quarterback the steps that are taken by the Israeli government to provide for the security and self-defense of their country.\xc2\xa0 But what I will say is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times and the President has said many times, which is that we are very concerned about the well-being of civilians in that region on both sides of the border.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that we are advocating so aggressively for the cease-fire is that it would benefit those innocent civilians that are currently caught in the cross-fire.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the immigration push, you said that you would hope there would be bipartisan support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan, the supplemental he sent up to Congress.\xc2\xa0 There has been no bipartisan -- I mean, have you seen a single Republican in Congress come out in favor of the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly raises a lot of questions that there might be people who would complain about the situation, offer up specific proposals in their own mind about what kinds of things we need to address the problem, and then not forcefully support the President when he does exactly that.\xc2\xa0 Only they can explain why that situation exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but given that you have failed to get any bipartisan support for that plan, and we now see there has been at least one bipartisan plan put forward -- Senator Cornyn-Congressman Cuellar -- has the President been in touch with either of them about their proposal?\xc2\xa0 I understand you said we don\'t see legislative language yet.\xc2\xa0 But we know the outlines of what they\'re proposing.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been in touch with them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any presidential calls to read out.\xc2\xa0 But we will review their legislation once it has been filed and finalized and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give it due consideration.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve attempted to work through this and to try to find a solution to this problem.\xc2\xa0 These are two representatives from the state of Texas, so they have some firsthand experience dealing with these issues.\xc2\xa0 But again, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reserve judgment on their proposal until we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to review it.</p>\n<p>Wendell.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I misread him, or was the President enjoying himself in his photo op this morning?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President seemed to be in good spirits today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he likely to be just as unhappy with the photo op he has planned later this week on infrastructure?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unhappy or happy?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unhappy.\xc2\xa0 Given that he was pretty happy with today\xe2\x80\x99s driving instruction.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess I don\'t quite understand your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m getting back to his blowing off photo ops on the border.\xc2\xa0 Was he concerned that that might send the wrong message to people in Central America if he went to the border?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President is concerned about is focusing on solutions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what the President was focused on last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll grant you that.\xc2\xa0 But he said he didn\'t like photo ops, and he seemed to be having a pretty good time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President\xe2\x80\x99s concern is, is people who put photo ops ahead of actually finding solutions to problems.\xc2\xa0 And I think all too often that\'s what we saw last week from our opponents on the other side of this issue.\xc2\xa0 They were eager to appear on camera, for example, touting the benefits of increased investments in border security, while at the same time in Congress they\'re blocking proposals to actually add resources to our border to secure it.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s an indication of individuals who have their priorities mixed up.\xc2\xa0 They\'re focused on photo ops and not on solutions.</p>\n<p>The President is always going to put forward solutions and focus on those as his top priority.\xc2\xa0 If there are opportunities -- as I mentioned to Mr. Knoller last week, if there was an opportunity for the President to appear in a photo op that will reinforce the value of the solution that the President has put forward, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to participate.\xc2\xa0 And I think a great example of that is when the President traveled to Poland last month.\xc2\xa0 He stood in front of two American F-16s alongside the President of Poland and sent what I think is an unmistakable message to the people of Poland, to our NATO allies, and to the Russian President, that the United States is committed to the defense of our allies under the NATO agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Knoller and Goler goes a long way.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On another matter, Secretary of State Kerry indicated yesterday in Vienna that he\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit uncomfortable talking about American exceptionalism even though he suggests he believes in it strongly.\xc2\xa0 Does the President also have that kind of discomfort talking about American exceptionalism?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 The President has said on many occasions that this is the greatest country in the world; that the President believes that the story of his life is one that could only be told in this country because of the tremendous opportunities that have been afforded to him by this country.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard the President speak on many occasions about how -- when all of these foreign policy issues come up, that people often reasonably wonder what\xe2\x80\x99s the United States going to do about it because the United States is the one indispensable country in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And because of the role that this President has played in enhancing our standing in the international community, that role is -- continues to endure.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to using that influence and the United States -- and the goodwill of the United States as a force for good in the global community.</p>\n<p>Okay, let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, while relations with Republicans may be on the rise a little bit, on the other hand, is the President aware, regarding the border issue, he may have to quell some kind of rebellion within his own party to get the money that you so desperately say is needed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see who eventually will come forward to support the kind of solutions that the President has put forward to a problem that everybody acknowledges, both Democrats and Republicans, exists on our southwest border.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a common-sense proposal.\xc2\xa0 We think it merits the support of both Democrats and Republicans, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason I asked that is because -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting a Jeff Zeleny from ABC tweet here, that says --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a bright, young man.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Senator Menendez, the Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, says that the Cornyn-Cuellar Humane Act is inhumane, \xe2\x80\x9cThey can call it what they want. What is humane is the law as it exists.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now, Menendez -- it\xe2\x80\x99s another network, but you can certainly anticipate he feels that way.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have not had an opportunity to review the piece of legislation that apparently Senator Menendez has had the opportunity to read through.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reserve judgment until we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to review it.\xc2\xa0 And if we get a chance tomorrow to review that legislation then maybe I can come back with a better answer then.</p>\n<p>Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the situation -- last week, a Mexican court determined that Sergeant Tahmooressi would remain there.\xc2\xa0 There is still an existing petition on We the People, the White House website, with more than 100,000 signatures asking that the President directly get involved in that situation.\xc2\xa0 Will the President get involved, or is this something that the White would get involved in?\xc2\xa0 A response would be pending since it did cross the -- at least for the We the People site.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the response is still pending, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m going to reserve judgment until we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to respond to that specific petition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to immigration.\xc2\xa0 In Central America, certain officials from the Guatemala government is complaining that the Mexican government is not controlling correctly its southern border with Guatemala.\xc2\xa0 And some are calling this increase of immigration kids is the fault of the government of Mexico.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that assessment from the Guatemalan government?\xc2\xa0 And also, Under Secretary Shannon, he just announced that some funds of the initiative are going to be used to help the Mexican government to have a more secure southern border.\xc2\xa0 Is that what the President ordered last week to the State Department?\xc2\xa0 Nobody knows why Mr. Shannon announced that out of the blue yesterday in Mexico.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that specific announcement. I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department about that.\xc2\xa0 I know that there is an important and longstanding law enforcement relationship between the United States and Mexico, and we certainly value the important role that that relationship has played in bringing some security to communities throughout Mexico and had a corresponding impact on the security of the United States as well.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly are pleased that that relationship between the United States and Mexico exists.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of specific steps that the Mexican government has taken to secure their southern border, I mentioned at the beginning of a gaggle last week that Mexico had decided to -- as I recall -- open up four or five additional border patrol locations along its southern border and to better monitor actions along the border, and to crack down on illicit activity along the border.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly is a step that we would welcome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would anticipate that greater security along Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s southern border would contribute to improved border security along Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s northern border because we are seeing so many people trying to transit between those two borders.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly welcomed that announcement.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to offer the kind of support that Mexico feels is necessary to enhance those security protocols, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with Mexico on a range of border security measures going forward.</p>\n<p>As I think I pointed out in a previous briefing a couple of weeks ago, in the same way that the United States has seen a surge in individuals at our border originating from Central America, Mexico has seen a similar kind of surge.\xc2\xa0 So I know that they have their own concerns, legitimate concerns, about border security and the impact that this spike could have on their border security.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States and Mexico continues to cooperate on these issues.\xc2\xa0 President Obama called President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto a couple of weeks ago about this matter, and I would anticipate continued cooperation in the days ahead.</p>\n<p>Chris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Today, Congressman Frank Pallone sent a letter along with -- as part of 34 members of Congress urging President Obama not to include an exemption for religious organizations in that planned executive order barring anti-LGBT discrimination among federal contractors.\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the letter so I\xe2\x80\x99d hesitate to react to it, but I will tell you that the position that we still have here is that the President has directed his team to draw up an executive order for his consideration.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re working on something along those lines, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to talk about either the content of that possible executive order or the timing -- a timing on which it might be announced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in other news, over the weekend U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the administration would file a brief in support of litigation seeking marriage equality once that returns to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate the President will weigh in on the content in that brief to ensure that he\xe2\x80\x99ll advocate for a nationwide ruling in favor of marriage equality?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on that at this point. But once a case is filed at the Supreme Court and there is an opportunity for -- by the Department of Justice to file a brief, I may -- or may not -- be in a position to give you greater insight into the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in that filing.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:43 P.M.
