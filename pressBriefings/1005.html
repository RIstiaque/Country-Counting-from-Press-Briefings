EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming to the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore I get started, I would like to read to you something I am still looking for -- here we go -- a readout of the President\xe2\x80\x99s calls with Speaker of the House John Boehner and Majority Leader Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 Today the President made separate phone calls to Speaker Boehner and Leader Reid.\xc2\xa0 In his call to Speaker Boehner, the President reiterated the need and his commitment to work with Congress to extend the payroll tax cut for the entire year.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by almost the entire Senate is the only option to ensure that middle-class families are not hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President urged the Speaker to take up the bipartisan compromise passed in the Senate with overwhelming Democratic and Republican support that would prevent 160 million working Americans from being hit with a holiday tax hike on January 1st.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President also spoke with Leader Reid and again applauded him for the work he conducted with Minority Leader McConnell to achieve a successful bipartisan compromise that passed overwhelmingly in the Senate on Saturday, and Senator Reid reaffirmed his commitment to secure a bipartisan, year-long tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe President urged the Speaker to allow a vote on the one compromise that Democrats and Republicans passed together --<br/>\n<br/>Urged the Speaker?\xc2\xa0 Did you mean the senator?<br/>\n<br/> MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President urged the Speaker -- returning to the Speaker here -- to allow a vote on the one compromise that Democrats and Republicans passed together to give the American people the assurance they need during this holiday season that they will not see a significant tax hike in just 10 days.\xc2\xa0 Those calls took place within the last half hour.<br/>\n<br/> Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he get an answer from either one?<br/>\n<br/> THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the extent of the readout I have for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given the calls, is the White House more confident at this point that some sort of compromise could get through to prevent this tax hike from --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The compromise exists.\xc2\xa0 It is embodied in the Senate bill that was supported by 90 percent of the United States Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike.\xc2\xa0 It is available even now for the House to vote on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Unfortunately, thus far, the House leadership has refused to allow the House of Representatives to vote on that measure, which has overwhelmingly -- overwhelming bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 We urge the House leadership, Speaker Boehner, to reconsider that position, to allow the Senate bill to come up, to allow the House of Representatives to vote on it, because we are confident that it would pass with both Democratic and Republican support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t I know you all are aware, because many of you have been reporting on it, on the growing chorus of Republicans who are calling on Speaker Boehner and the House leadership to do the right thing and to pass this bipartisan compromise so that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up in 10 hours -- 10 days and 11 hours.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the result of failing to act:\xc2\xa0 Taxes go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe bipartisan compromise exists; it was worked out by the Senate Democratic leader and the Senate Republican leader in a process that was agreed upon with the Speaker of the House that produced a result that the Speaker of the House told his own membership that he supported and that he recommended they support.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t They should just get it done, and then we can all -- the Senate, the House, the administration -- work on extending the payroll tax cut for the entire year, a commitment this President has made from the beginning when he was the first to put on the table, through the American Jobs Act, a payroll tax cut extension for 2012.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we have to get this two-month extension done or else taxes will go up on the American people.\xc2\xa0 And it really is not that difficult.\xc2\xa0 The House has the ability to call up the Senate legislation, pass it and move on, and taxes will not go up.\xc2\xa0 The average American family will not have to worry about how to make ends meet with $1,000 less next year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t So we urge them to do that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President urged the Speaker to do just moments ago.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the White House and congressional Democrats be willing to give some sort of ironclad commitment to pass a full year\xe2\x80\x99s tax extension by a certain date early in 2012 in exchange for passing this two-month extension?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to a one-year tax cut.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s been pushing both here in Washington and around the country since September as part of the American Jobs Act, and then when it was separated out from the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 Senate Democrats, House Democrats are all committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 Republican leaders of both houses say they are committed to doing that.\xc2\xa0 It can be done, so it would require finishing the work that Senators McConnell and Reid started as they tried to reach a year-long agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey made good progress, but work needed to be done, which is why they then moved to the two-month extension to ensure that Americans didn\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 That is the sensible thing to do -- pass the two-month extension, return to work on the year-long extension, or else explain to the American people -- 160 million of them -- why Congress would not listen to them, would not listen -- why the House Republicans would not listen to their Senate colleagues, would not listen to Republican elder statesmen and stateswomen all around the country and the city telling them to do the right thing here.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the country and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the economy and it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the American people not to pass this bill.\xc2\xa0 So we feel very strongly about it, as you can tell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President expect to hear back from Speaker Boehner on whether this might be an option?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear -- again, not because I say it but many others are also saying it -- that the ball is in the House\xe2\x80\x99s court.\xc2\xa0 There is a compromise available, an avenue out of this blind alley, if you will, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve driven themselves into, and it is the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 Vote on it, pass it, and we can move on to discussing and figuring out a solution for the year-long extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Senator Corker, Republican from Tennessee:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen and I agree with the editorial this morning in The Wall Street Journal -- probably the best thing to do at this point is just get this behind us and move on,\xe2\x80\x9d urging the House Republican leadership to change course and endorse a compromise reached in the Senate that got the support of 90 percent of those members, Democrats and senators alike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Senator McCain:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt is harming the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 It is harming the view, if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible anymore, of the American people about Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo do the right thing:\xc2\xa0 Pass the payroll tax cut; make sure Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Alister.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just staying with this theme, so specifically what is the President offering the Speaker in return for sort of reversing himself on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You misunderstand here.\xc2\xa0 There is not -- this is not a game of poker, high-stakes poker, as one Republican congressman deemed it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 160 million Americans and their paychecks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no political quid pro quo here.\xc2\xa0 There was a bipartisan compromise reached with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, at the direction of the Republican leader in the House, that initially garnered the support of the Republican leader in the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And let\xe2\x80\x99s review some history here.\xc2\xa0 The President and Democrats initially supported, put forward the American Jobs Act, which was paid for entirely, including the payroll tax cut extension and expansion, and the pay-fors in that bill were what the President very firmly believed that if he could have his way entirely was the way it should be done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t When Republicans blocked that and the Senate Democrats crafted a separate payroll tax cut extension with UI extension and some other measures, and tried to move it and have it paid for by asking the 300,000 wealthiest Americans, millionaires and billionaires, to pay a little extra, Republicans blocked that.\xc2\xa0 So we compromised.\xc2\xa0 The President, the Senate compromised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And the deal that was passed, the compromise that was passed by the Senate by a vote of 89-10, did not have the pay-fors that the Democrats wanted, did not have the pay-fors that the President initially submitted, but they had a compromised set of provisions that paid for it that won the agreement of 89 senators, including 39 Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That is the essence of compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t The bill even included an extraneous political victory that Republicans insisted on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me try something else, but staying with the theme.\xc2\xa0 The CR runs out on Friday.\xc2\xa0 When will the President sign the omnibus bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When it gets here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What happens if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got here by --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It will get here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if it\xe2\x80\x99s physically here yet, but when it arrives there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in that august institution that takes time in terms of producing the bill for him to sign, but he will sign it when it gets here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And on Syria, what do additional steps to pressure the Assad regime mean?\xc2\xa0 What are you talking about there specifically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is -- of the matter is that we have throughout this process worked both unilaterally and collectively to increase pressure and isolation on the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 What you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is a continuation of horrific acts of violence, needless violence, against the Syrian people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that every metric shows the situation is moving against Assad:\xc2\xa0 Defections of the military are on the rise.\xc2\xa0 Diplomats have begun leaving their posts and coming out in support of the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 The opposition is more unified and more inclusive.\xc2\xa0 The regime has been cut off by the Arab League, by its traditional allies and neighbors like Turkey, and the regime is under increasing financial duress due to international sanctions and weak domestic economic policies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is only a matter of time before this regime comes to an end.\xc2\xa0 Only fear is holding it together, and governing that is based on fear is always doomed to fail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you talking about sanctions or what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details to provide to you about additional measures we will take, but we will continue to pressure, working with our international partners, the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And the writing is on the wall.\xc2\xa0 The isolation increases.\xc2\xa0 And more and more members of the international community of nations are joining the call for Syria to stop this atrocious behavior.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Yes, Jessica.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clearly the President will stay in town to sign the omnibus, but now he said it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Speaker to take -- make the next move.\xc2\xa0 So what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s next move?\xc2\xa0 Will he go join his family in Hawaii?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to give you.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously in a pretty fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 But the President made clear in his call to Speaker Boehner earlier today, as I made clear in the readout, that the action that must be taken is the House needs to take up the Senate bill that was supported by an overwhelming percentage of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and pass it to make sure that taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which is to say he has no intention of negotiating --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The negotiating has happened already.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- as I just explained, it is not at all the case that this is simply the President saying, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I want and do it; this was a compromise worked out by the Republican leader in the Senate with the Democratic leader in the Senate, with the approval -- in fact, even the instigation -- of the Speaker of the House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So The Wall Street Journal today opined that the President has won this battle politically -- to paraphrase, not quote them.\xc2\xa0 But if the payroll tax cut is not extended, the economy -- most economists are saying we will suffer.\xc2\xa0 So how concerned is the White House that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get extended and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy will take a big hit?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned of two things, the micro and the macro, if you will -- the macroeconomic effect on growth that not extending this tax cut, not extending unemployment insurance would have; outside independent economists, not the ones who seem to disagree with basic economic fact, say that it could have a negative of up to 0.5 percent of GDP.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t We firmly believe that in the end, because there is such, now, overwhelming support for the payroll tax cut and extending it for a year, that this will get done.\xc2\xa0 We believe that eventually the House leadership, House Republicans, will understand that this is not about giving President Obama a victory; this is about exercising their authority on behalf and at the demand of the American people, a bipartisan consensus of the American people as represented by the enormous bipartisan vote in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And at the microeconomic level, we\xe2\x80\x99re worried about individual families who need that extra money, an average of $40 a paycheck.\xc2\xa0 As you know on Tuesday, the White House called on Americans to add their voice to the conversation here in Washington about why we need to extend the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 If Congress fails, if the House fails to act, the typical family making $50,000 a year will have about $40 less to spend or save with each paycheck.\xc2\xa0 That adds up to about a thousand bucks for the year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n The response has been extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 Over 17,000 submissions I think is the last information I got.\xc2\xa0 Someone contacting us from Connecticut says, \xe2\x80\x9cI can buy lunch from the cafeteria for almost a whole month for my twins.\xc2\xa0 I can buy food or pay for gas.\xc2\xa0 I can save it for my daughter\xe2\x80\x99s prescriptions -- prescription deductibles.\xc2\xa0 To some people $40 is nothing, but $40 is big money for us.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn West Virginia someone wrote in saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter everything that comes out, including my mortgage, my take-home pay is $150 every two weeks.\xc2\xa0 So minus $40 would be $110.\xc2\xa0 I can barely get by now.\xc2\xa0 That 40 bucks is my gas for my car to get to work.\xc2\xa0 Taking $40 away from my pay would just about put me under.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t This matters.\xc2\xa0 This is real, real stuff.\xc2\xa0 This is not about high-stakes poker or political brinkmanship.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about 160 million Americans and their families and the impact that failure to act would have on them.\xc2\xa0 And the voices are growing louder from average Americans, from Republicans in Congress and the Senate -- even in the House now -- from respected commentators within the conservative arena.\xc2\xa0 The House needs to act.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not behaving in the interests of the country.\xc2\xa0 We want to do this together with them.\xc2\xa0 We want to work with the Congress, with Republicans and Democrats alike.\xc2\xa0 That is how we achieved the compromise in the Senate that was authored -- co-authored by Senator McConnell.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to get this done for the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Hey, Mr. Knoller.\xc2\xa0 Nice to have you in the front row.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell Norah.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is the White House at odds with Speaker Boehner when he said earlier today that rather than do a two-month bill now, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of time left in the year for the Senate to come back, choose negotiators and work out a year-long extension of the payroll tax cut bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We disagree with that proposition because we need the insurance -- we need to make sure that taxes do not go up on January 1st, and that insurance is the compromise two-month extension that was voted on by -- 89-10 -- by Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t We are absolutely committed to working with Congress for a year-long extension.\xc2\xa0 The President was out there, certainly without any Republican support in the beginning here in the fall pushing this.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have gone from opposing it to tepid support to now insisting that it would cause -- we\xe2\x80\x99d rather have taxes go up on the American people on January 1st than create the uncertainty of a two-month extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Let\xe2\x80\x99s take you back to that, for some of us, distant period in the summer when Republicans were insisting that, as part of the deficit, or rather the debt ceiling negotiations, that we return to raising the debt ceiling every few months; and in fact that we would return to it by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 You want to talk about an uncertainty that would be created for the economy?\xc2\xa0 The threat of default?\xc2\xa0 You remember what it was like in August.\xc2\xa0 So their concern about the uncertainty of passing this two-month extension seems hollow to my ears.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another subject before --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry, Mark, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we let you go, is there any White House comment about eight American soldiers charged in the death of a fellow soldier in Afghanistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I apologize, Mark, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 But I can take the question and get back to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There were reports that there were three, I believe, Iranian -- or, sorry, five Iranian engineers that were captured in Syria working on a power plant.\xc2\xa0 With the statement that you issued earlier today, you said that you\xe2\x80\x99re condemning, I guess, the Syrian regime and you are calling for action, I guess, bend the -- people in the region to bend against the regime, but are you calling for stronger action?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is -- or have you been speaking to your allies in the region to take stronger action against Syria?\xc2\xa0 Because things are -- I mean, especially with the Iranians now in the country, I mean, it seems that things are ramping up there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that, from the start of this process, with regards to Syria, we have ratcheted up pressure on Syria.\xc2\xa0 You have seen the United States working with our partners, working with our allies, participate in an effort that has increased international isolation of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And so the steps we have taken have been all in one direction, if you will, which is to put pressure on Syria to make clear that Assad has lost his legitimacy to rule and to further isolate his regime as we call on him to cease the violence and to begin a democratic transition in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t We will continue to take those steps to pressure the regime to stop its crackdown.\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in terms of the -- by the reporting and by the international condemnation of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in that country, the world is watching.\xc2\xa0 And increasingly, Assad\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy is -- has been lost around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that process will continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you aware of these reports of the Iranian engineers?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there have not been discussions with people in the region for increased action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any response on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s go Ed and then --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you were graciously answering my question about the President on 60 Minutes saying that maybe --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to know if the invitation for Christmas still stands?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I was going to let that pass.\xc2\xa0 But have you had a chance to talk to the President?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No updates on scheduling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 In all seriousness, I did ask you yesterday -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to belabor it after the President came out.\xc2\xa0 He came out while you were talking about -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot talked about this week, with the President telling CBS that if you stack up his accomplishments in the first couple of years it\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth best in history.\xc2\xa0 He said only Lincoln and a couple others were ahead of it.\xc2\xa0 So can you talk a little bit about how he compares to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I mean, this has obviously been of great interest in the conservative blogosphere, but the fact of the matter is, he has -- he was making a point about the volume and substance of the legislative accomplishments, and the foreign policy accomplishments, in his nearly three years in power.\xc2\xa0 He was not making an assertion of -- that only historians will make about the success or -- this was not a comparison of success to other presidencies except in the significance and substance and size of the legislative accomplishments, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s health care reform, which was an effort that took 100 years to accomplish; or the Recovery Act, which was an enormous response to an historic economic crisis; the bailout of the automobile industry, the saving of the American automobile industry against great political opposition; and on the foreign policy front, continuing to take the fight successfully to al Qaeda, embodied most notably in the successful mission to remove Osama bin Laden from the battlefield; the successful efforts that we led to bring the international community behind the effort of the Libyan opposition to remove Moammar Qaddafi from power.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI could go on, and believe me, I will, as time permits.\xc2\xa0 But it was within the context of the substance and volume of what has happened in the face of enormous challenges in these past nearly three years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on another subject, which is there had been commentary a couple weeks ago but now it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of died down because of the payroll tax cut fight -- but that the President might make some recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of people in both parties wondering, does he reserve that right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know when they\xe2\x80\x99re going to actually recess, I suppose, as we continue -- this drags out.\xc2\xa0 But is there a possibility that Richard Cordray could be named by recess appointment?\xc2\xa0 Are there people in the NLRB?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your sense about that possibility?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make or speculation to engage in on that front.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re not relinquishing any rights here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would note that it is unfortunate that although we had some significant nominations succeed, many, many others unnecessarily have been blocked.\xc2\xa0 The effect of that, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on ambassadorial nominations or judicial nominations, is very damaging, and it is a constant problem and a growing problem where random senators put holds on nominations that are absolutely uncontroversial.\xc2\xa0 And that practice should stop.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And I think this President will continue to nominate highly qualified people for important positions around our government and our foreign service and onto the bench.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Richard Cordray, and this is a perfect example of an abomination in terms of Senate behavior.\xc2\xa0 He is widely respected, has broad bipartisan support across the country.\xc2\xa0 He is exactly the right person for the job to be the consumer watchdog, the overseer of this agency that is in place to ensure that average Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t get taken advantage of by financial institutions, that they have an advocate for them here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 Republicans blocked that because they want to water down Wall Street reforms, reforms that were put in place to help prevent the kind of financial crisis that almost tipped the global economy into a depression.\xc2\xa0 Seems like a bad idea.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I did say -- David, go ahead.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President said he needed the Speaker to do something.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker said, \xe2\x80\x9cI need the President to do something.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t My assumption would be the Speaker expected something more than a phone call.\xc2\xa0 He was looking for something from the President as far as negotiations; you say there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to negotiate.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker is in a corner, he\xe2\x80\x99s boxed in a corner.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to do nothing to help the Speaker get out of that corner?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is doing everything he can to help the American people.\xc2\xa0 The Speaker is very capable of helping himself by calling a vote on the Senate compromise, a compromise that received the support of 80 percent of the Republican senators and even a greater percentage of Democratic senators.\xc2\xa0 There is a bipartisan compromise available to him as a lifesaver, if you will.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But politically he\xe2\x80\x99s in a box.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything the President can do?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, honestly, the important thing here is not who\xe2\x80\x99s up and who\xe2\x80\x99s down politically because, as I talked about yesterday, we are beginning to see some positive signs in the economy.\xc2\xa0 We are a long way from full economic recovery, but the last thing we need to do is fail to pass a payroll tax cut extension which would have a negative impact on the kind of economic growth that we have been seeing and need to continue to see.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just wrong at every level to prevent this from passing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On North Korea, there were some indications coming out of China that maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s some power-sharing agreement.\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on the situation in North Korea?\xc2\xa0 Have you had any kind of communications through intermediaries or the North Korean government itself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring the situation closely.\xc2\xa0 Kim Jong-il had designated Kim Jong-un as his official successor, and at this time we have no indication that that has changed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t We hope that the new North Korean leadership will take the steps necessary to support peace, prosperity and a better future for the North Korean people, including through acting on its commitments to denuclearization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I stressed I think the day before last, we are in a period of transition.\xc2\xa0 North Korea is in a period of national mourning.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re monitoring events closely.\xc2\xa0 We hope that the new leadership will support peace and prosperity and a better future for its people, and that it will abide by its commitments on denuclearization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And no communication from the North Korean government or intermediaries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the administration called on the American people to weigh in, to lend their voices to this.\xc2\xa0 Realistically speaking, do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help break this impasse?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?\xc2\xa0 I know you just read some testimonials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do think it will because as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said now for a while, even prior to this current situation, we are optimistic or at least hopeful that Congress will act on some of these common-sense, mainstream measures to help grow the economy, help the American people and improve our employment situation, not because we\xe2\x80\x99re for them -- that\xe2\x80\x99s probably a negative in the eyes of the highly politicized and partisan House of Representatives Republican Party, but because their constituents are demanding it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And I, of course, don\xe2\x80\x99t have a ton of data here, but I suspect that the voices that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from -- by people who are responding to the #40dollars that we started yesterday, that they are representative of folks around the country in the districts of House Republicans, as well as Democrats in the states all over the country for whom $40 a paycheck is a big deal, that it means the difference -- for someone from North Carolina, it\xe2\x80\x99s the -- \xe2\x80\x9cThat $40 buys my gas for a week to drive to work, or it buys my groceries for a week.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough making ends meet and $40 is a lot of money to me.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn Texas:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThat is almost one week of groceries for me or how much it costs to fill my gas tank for one and a half weeks or medical co-pays at the specialist office.\xc2\xa0 Which one am I to go without?\xc2\xa0 This is going to hurt.\xc2\xa0 Please don\xe2\x80\x99t let this happen.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, I think that the thousands of responses we\xe2\x80\x99ve had so far are representative of the hundreds of thousands and millions of responses you would get if you were -- and if the members of the House of Representatives were to survey their own constituents.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFor most people, $1,000 out of their paycheck next year is an enormous hit, and in this economy, we cannot let that happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Afghanistan quickly --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a senior military commander suggested that troops might need to, in fact, stay -- American forces might need to, in fact, stay beyond 2014.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?\xc2\xa0 And is that a possibility --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Kristen.\xc2\xa0 As established in Lisbon at NATO and as made clear through the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan policy, one, we are in the process of drawing down the surge.\xc2\xa0 And by the end of 2014, we will have turned over full security lead to Afghan forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have made clear all along that much as in Iraq when we turned over full security lead to the Iraqi forces that would be part of a process that may include troops in support.\xc2\xa0 And make no mistake -- and I have an announcement to make, which is that we have met the commitment to reduce by the end of this year our forces by 10,000 in Afghanistan, as we begin to reduce the surge forces, as the President committed to do.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue that process, and when the surge forces are out between that end date, which I guess is September of next year, through the end of 2014, there will be a continued reduction in U.S. forces as we turn over more and more of the country to Afghan security lead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat has been clearly spelled out from Lisbon on so that -- and is entirely consistent with what General Allen said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so just to put a point on it, the commander was wrong -- was not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I said it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with what General Allen said, that the process of turning over entirely the security lead to the Afghans is the result of a gradual reduction of forces and a building up of Afghan security forces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have said from the beginning that there could be U.S. forces in Afghanistan beyond the end of 2014 in a support role just as they were after August 2010 in a support role in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 From that point forward in Iraq, we have drawn down now to zero in accordance with our agreement with the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 So that is entirely consistent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the payroll tax cut for a second, a follow-up to David\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Put yourself in the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s shoes -- are you suggesting that he cobble together maybe a House majority of willing Democrats and whatever Republicans he might be able to get to go along, even if it goes against the majority of his own caucus in the House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Am I suggesting that for the sake of 160 million people he should allow this vote to happen and allow his House Republicans to vote their conscience, which would result, because of overwhelming Democrat support, in the passage of the Senate bill?\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one way he could do it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason why they didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote on it the other day, because it would have passed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the shame of all this.\xc2\xa0 There are, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident, more than enough House Republicans who want to bring this to an end, who want to ensure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st and certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to explain to their constituents why they took a vote so that their taxes would go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And if it came to the floor of the House, it would pass.\xc2\xa0 It would have near unanimous support from Democratic members, and I am confident that the 30-odd Republicans it would require to pass this measure would vote yes, at least.\xc2\xa0 And then we can move on to the next thing that we all agree on, which is that we have to get this payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance extended for the full year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might that not spark a revolt within his own caucus?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has an enormous amount of responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 Every President does.\xc2\xa0 He cannot be responsible for the internal politics of the other party in one house of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He is simply focused on doing what is best for the American people, and working with Republicans, as well as Democrats, to achieve what\xe2\x80\x99s best for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the bipartisan compromise reached in the Senate represents.\xc2\xa0 Ninety percent of the United States Senate on a substantive issue, an important issue like this, is quite an accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 Senators McConnell and Reid deserve a lot of credit for the work they did on achieving the two-month extension and on the progress they made towards a full-year extension.\xc2\xa0 And so the House should act on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen that often when we have this kind of bipartisan consensus on an important issue.\xc2\xa0 We should act on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get a little bit better sense of what happens next.\xc2\xa0 As you said, the ball is in the House\xe2\x80\x99s court.\xc2\xa0 Did the President set any time -- did he and Boehner set any time to talk again?\xc2\xa0 Or is this the time, the time that\xe2\x80\x99s behind here on this clock?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing more I can read out to you from the conversation with the Speaker of the House.\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear, and I provided you the essence of what he said to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 There is an available solution:\xc2\xa0 The House should pass the two-month extension to ensure that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President, as he has repeatedly, affirmed his commitment to a one-year extension.\xc2\xa0 He, after all, started this conversation and has been pushing for a full-year extension since September -- and there is a way to get there.\xc2\xa0 And this President and Democrats have been clearly willing to compromise, to accept that they could not get Republican support for what we believe and they believe was the right thing to do, which was ask the 300,000 wealthiest Americans, millionaires and billionaires all, to pay a little bit more so that 160 million Americans got a tax cut.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut since the Republicans oppose that almost unanimously, Senate Democrats, with this President\xe2\x80\x99s full support, were able to work out a compromise with Senate Republicans, that included pay-fors that we found acceptable and that made sense as a policy matter, that did not violate the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles in terms of doing damage to the economy or harming the very people you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help with the payroll tax cut extension or with unemployment insurance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why did he decide to call Boehner?\xc2\xa0 When you were asked yesterday if he was going to be calling Boehner you laughed it off.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh it off.\xc2\xa0 I simply said that there was an available action here that the House should pass the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 The President speaks with Speaker Boehner periodically.\xc2\xa0 He called him to urge him to do the right thing here, which is bring up the Senate bill in the House, which is something he can still do, contrary to some tweets I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out there.\xc2\xa0 They absolutely can take up the Senate bill and pass it.\xc2\xa0 It will be signed by this President, gladly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret, and then -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, then I -- Margaret, then in the back, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll jump around -- Laura.\xc2\xa0 Settle in, folks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to, like, take a stab at this, but I feel like it may not work.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re all caught in the middle of basically a game where I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- are you guys just sort of making the House Republicans twist in the wind a little bit more, and then this is going to get worked out?\xc2\xa0 It just seems, if the President was really done with it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he just be on a plane to Hawaii right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to give you.\xc2\xa0 The President just got off the phone within the last hour now with the Speaker of the House, urging him to do the right thing, to take up the Senate bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is not about, like -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a clear avenue here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re shining a light on the path out of this cul-de-sac that they\xe2\x80\x99ve driven themselves into, and it is to vote on a bill that -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not asking them to vote on a bill that only Democrats supported, we\xe2\x80\x99re asking them to vote \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d on a bill that 82 percent or something, or 80 percent of Senate Republicans supported.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the House --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It seems not that much of an ask.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the House\xe2\x80\x99s way out of it now effectively do that with just sort of a little bit more so that their members can vote for it?\xc2\xa0 And I mean, in the end, if what you really want is just a resolution, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that resolve that without really undercutting the places where you guys want to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Closing what resolve?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A two-month extension with some language that requires a year-long deal.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem that out of reach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that means.\xc2\xa0 Requires a year-long deal on whose terms?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you saw what the House Republicans put out yesterday, and clearly demonstrating that this is not a payroll tax cut for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s about trying to get some political victories on ideological issues.\xc2\xa0 So they took the willingness that Senate Democrats demonstrated and this President demonstrated to accept their totally extraneous provision on Keystone, and decided that that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, they wanted a little more, and they wanted a bunch of other things that simply moved them away from bipartisanship and moved them away from compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n So the President is committed to a full-year extension.\xc2\xa0 He has demonstrated his willingness to agree to pay-fors that are different from the ones he put forward and from the ones that Senate Democrats put forward.\xc2\xa0 But they have to make sense.\xc2\xa0 They have to make economic sense, and they have to make sense in terms of the impact on average Americans out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t So they should pass the two-month, and then we can get to negotiating the year-long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iraq, the Vice President made a couple of phone calls yesterday, and I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, is the President -- has the President or has Vice President Biden spoken with the Vice President of Iraq?\xc2\xa0 What is -- what was the point of those calls?\xc2\xa0 How does President Obama feel about the arrest and the charges against this Vice President?\xc2\xa0 And what, if anything, at this point can the U.S. do about it?\xc2\xa0 Are you considering pulling aid?\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re not -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Margaret, let me stop you there.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I think we read out some of the calls that the Vice President made.\xc2\xa0 Separately, this kind of political turmoil has been occurring in Iraq periodically, as they have taken steps forward and, occasionally, steps backward, but generally made progress towards political reconciliation, towards democracy, and away from the use of violence in pursuit of political ends.\xc2\xa0 That has been progress, but it has often been hard won.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t That will continue.\xc2\xa0 We certainly expect that there will be difficult days ahead in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But the progress has been substantial.\xc2\xa0 What is utterly nonsensical is the suggestion that somehow we should have left troops in there, and that would have had any impact on the political disputes.\xc2\xa0 Because maybe folks weren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention, but political disputes have been happening while there were 40,000 troops, 80,000 troops, 150,000 troops.\xc2\xa0 The key metric here is that those political disputes have increasingly been resolved through negotiation, not through violence, and elections were held, a government was established -- these are all signs of important progress -- all while violence declined significantly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t We will continue to have a robust and important relationship with Iraq.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to have frequent, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, discussions with Iraqi leaders.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to weigh in and encourage Iraqi leaders to make smart decisions as they continue to move forward with the development of their democracy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t I wanted to -- as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re on foreign policy, I just want to be clear on a question that Kristen had about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I just want to say, on 2014, the President will make his decisions on the size and shape of our post-September 2012 presence, after the reduction of the surge forces, at the appropriate time in consultation with our Afghan and NATO partners.\xc2\xa0 Any post-2014 presence would of course be at the invitation of the Afghan government, and would ensure that we will be able to target terrorists and support a sovereign Afghan government so that our enemies cannot outlast us.\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t But the framework that I discussed at the top was laid out at Lisbon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t I think I owe you -- yes, Lesley.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a quick question, following on Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s sort of suggestions today that he wants to shed some of the members of the coalition government that he might not sort of get along with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have -- I would refer you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it in front of me -- to -- we did a readout of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s calls, yes -- to that statement.\xc2\xa0 And we have worked, the Vice President has and other members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team have, with Iraq on the political process.\xc2\xa0 It is very important, and has been, and will continue to be, that Iraqi leaders pursue a representative government so that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interests are properly represented.\xc2\xa0 And beyond that, I would just refer you to the statement we put out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He also said that the U.S. has asked him to free some of the Hashimi guards that he had jailed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Who did?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said that the U.S. government had asked him to free some --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Maliki did?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more on that for you today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Can I just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis and then, yes --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 John.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 John, of course.\xc2\xa0 Okay, Alexis, then John.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 I want to clarify:\xc2\xa0 You were reading these moving comments from people who talk about what they can do with $40.\xc2\xa0 The President had originally asked for the 3.1 percent, an expansion.\xc2\xa0 When he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about getting a year extension, and I just want to clarify, he\xe2\x80\x99s still talking about sticking with an extension, not an expansion, considering that they would get 60 bucks a paycheck, correct?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no question, but that was part of -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you mentioned it, Alexis -- because that was part of our compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to argue for that -- if he gets the two-months insurance, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to then say, okay, look, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to talking about expanding this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict, but he may say that that would be a good thing to do.\xc2\xa0 But he is absolutely willing to sign a appropriately paid-for one-year extension of the payroll tax cut at its current levels.\xc2\xa0 He -- you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right -- initially supported an expansion of that, and as part of the compromise -- another data point in my presentation on the ways in which the President and Senate Democrats have compromised in these negotiations, and the way that that compromise has led to a result that garnered a vote of 89-10 in the Senate -- I mean, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s, again, a demonstration of his understanding that in a divided government you don\xe2\x80\x99t get everything you want.\xc2\xa0 And he was willing -- he is very willing to sign into law this two-month extension that was passed by the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And he is very eager to work with Congress to continue the progress that Senators McConnell and Reid made towards extending it for a full year at its current level.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t He believed, and still believes, of course, that more would be better.\xc2\xa0 But what absolutely must not happen is that nothing is passed by the House and taxes go up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me ask another question to follow up on Ed, real quick.\xc2\xa0 Ed\xe2\x80\x99s question about the President\xe2\x80\x99s sense of history and where he fits into it -- in my previous experience covering the White House, most presidents get that information from somebody who does that analysis for them, somebody -- from a historian or a political scientist or a political advisor.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us where that assessment came from?\xc2\xa0 Did the President do it himself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is a well-read individual, and was prior to coming into office, and reads voraciously in office.\xc2\xa0 So, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an assessment that others may have made on the outside simply by the sheer volume of what has been accomplished by this President and by Congress in the last three years.\xc2\xa0 And part of the size of the record -- and voters will judge it and historians will judge it in terms of where it fits in terms of American history and its relative success or greatness.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s not what he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 He was talking about -- he came into office, working with Congress, facing enormous challenges for this country -- an economy in freefall, the real threat of a global depression, two wars and enormous challenges elsewhere in foreign affairs -- and he, with Congress, took action to deal with them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the times demanded.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd Congress passed some very big pieces of legislation that did big things -- Wall Street reform, successfully saving the American automobile industry, the Recovery Act, health care reform -- and then, of course, as I mentioned, a number of foreign policy successes -- successfully and responsibly ending the war in Iraq, beginning the drawdown in Afghanistan, taking the fight aggressively to al Qaeda, repositioning ourselves -- reorienting ourselves to reassert ourselves as a Pacific player and power because of the neglect that the prior administration had towards Asia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are all big things.\xc2\xa0 And you all and your successors and historians will judge the success of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s done, and voters will have an opportunity obviously to do that in less than a year.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no arguing about the volume and the substantial nature of what has been done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we just ask -- the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office has put out a little readout of the call, and they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Speaker Boehner appears to be dug in as well, just as the President was on the two-month.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner is saying, bring the Senate back, appoint the conferees, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before.\xc2\xa0 And the quote from the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office is that the Speaker said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get it done today.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So where are we?\xc2\xa0 We seem to be at the same spot.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today, Congressmen Van Hollen and Hoyer, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, attempted to bring up the Senate bill in the House and they were gaveled down by Republican congressmen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat opportunity is there.\xc2\xa0 If the Speaker wants to get it done today I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can get it done today.\xc2\xa0 We can pass the two-month extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he wants a one-year extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he knows, and the President made very clear to him, that the avenue available to him, the Speaker of the House, to avoid raising taxes on 160 million Americans is to pass the measure that won overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 This sudden insistence on the uncertainty created by a two-month extension is just -- you guys know, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering this.\xc2\xa0 You know it\xe2\x80\x99s -- it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ring true, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI mean, this was the same leadership that thought it would be a good idea for the global and American economy to have periodic fights and stalemates over -- and brinkmanship -- over defaulting on the full faith and credit of the United States government.\xc2\xa0 Talk about uncertainty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe uncertainty that we have to eliminate is the uncertainty that Americans have right now about whether or not their taxes are going to go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 There is a bipartisan compromise available to make sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen -- just take it.\xc2\xa0 Just take it.\xc2\xa0 Follow the advice of numerous Republican senators.\xc2\xa0 Follow the advice of the Wall Street editorial page -- words I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d speak.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Follow the advice of Senators McCain and Corker and Grassley and others, and pass the bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 Make sure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the Speaker has now responded to your statement and says that he wants the President to urge Senator Reid to appoint conferees, isn\xe2\x80\x99t this the classic definition of a stalemate or a deadlock?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a classic -- there is a stalemate in that the Speaker will not act.\xc2\xa0 A bipartisan compromise was negotiated.\xc2\xa0 And as you know and reported on, it was supported overwhelmingly by Republicans in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 It was the product of a negotiation that the Speaker of the House helped initiate and urged to happen.\xc2\xa0 It was a product that the Speaker of the House endorsed through his own colleagues on a conference call, as has been widely reported.\xc2\xa0 It is a product that has the support of Republicans in the Senate, in the House, outside, in conservative circles.\xc2\xa0 It should just get done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And what is absolutely the wrong way to look at this and would be a disservice to readers and viewers would be to say both sides are to blame; neither side wants to compromise; Democrats won\xe2\x80\x99t move and Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t move.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the story of what happened here in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Democratic leaders, Republican leaders got together, worked out a compromise that won overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of stuff people are dying to see in Washington, and it worked; the President supports it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t For a while, it seemed -- or 24 hours there -- it seemed like House leaders in the Republican Party supported it, until I guess they were told not to by a subfaction or some representation, some sizeable group within the House Republican conference.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t But that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not speaking for the overwhelming majority of the American people, Republicans in the country, for -- certainly for their colleagues in the Senate, all of whom want them to pass this bipartisan, sensible compromise to ensure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up, and then as everybody has agreed on, to then refocus our efforts on getting a full-year extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way out there.\xc2\xa0 There is a bill -- there is a bipartisan compromise available.\xc2\xa0 The negotiation has happened.\xc2\xa0 He sat down with Senator McConnell and Senator Reid and urged that process to begin.\xc2\xa0 They worked hard on a year-long.\xc2\xa0 When they felt like they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it by the end of the year they recommended this two-year -- two-month compromise.\xc2\xa0 Republicans and Democrats overwhelmingly agreed.\xc2\xa0 They should take it up and pass it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLaura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One is, can you tell us how long the conversation lasted with the Speaker?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About 10 minutes.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact time for you, but it seemed like about 10 minutes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so obviously more was said than what you said in the readout if it was 10 minutes long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you a transcript if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xc2\xa0 But, look, the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unless they just both repeated themselves over and over.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was very clear in stating what I told you he said.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he could be any clearer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out is both sides have now put out readouts where they say that their principals essentially reiterated their public positions.\xc2\xa0 My question is whether in this conversation there was any hope for advancing this beyond the publicly stated position of each side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you the readout.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t -- it is an absolutely fair representation of what the President said, and I leave it to the Speaker to characterize what he said.\xc2\xa0 But what I described to you is exactly what the President said.\xc2\xa0 It is exactly his position.\xc2\xa0 It is his public position and it is his private position the House should take up the Senate compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about how everyone is committed to a year-long deal and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get that done, but we just need to pass this crisis moment.\xc2\xa0 What makes you think that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be so easy to get a year-long deal, given that, with all due respect, the parties have failed to do so until now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Senators Reid and McConnell made progress; that process needs to continue.\xc2\xa0 The ways -- there are ways to do this that are not difficult.\xc2\xa0 They represent choices, but there are ways to pay for this that the President can accept, Democrats can accept, and we see no reason why Republicans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t accept.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t The issues that they put forward in their -- whatever that thing is that they voted on yesterday so that they could avoid actually voting on the bill, were filled with things that had nothing to do with the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Nothing at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\nQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but what makes you think that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to get past all those things that have nothing to do with the payroll tax when you start negotiating in January?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that the voices of the people from West Virginia, Texas, Connecticut and everywhere else are going to be heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear:\xc2\xa0 Great progress was made in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 There are ways to do this for a year that everybody, we believe, can agree on -- certainly, at least, the President, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats, as well as House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s one -- speaking of isolation -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s one isolated group here that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to join the overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans who support doing one thing on behalf of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Increasingly, I think that isolation is becoming clear.\xc2\xa0 And I expect that House Republicans will be hearing from their constituents and maybe from other folks whose opinion they respect, and maybe that will have an effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe politics of this are really so far less important than the substance here, because as I think Jessica pointed out early on in the briefing, there is an absolute economic impact of failing to act here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a macroeconomic impact, a reduction of economic growth by up to 0.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 That would have a direct effect on employment.\xc2\xa0 There would be a terrible and direct effect on those who would no longer receive unemployment insurance as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to meet their house payments and pay their bills while they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd all of that -- the withdrawal of all of those resources from the economy would be negative, and the effect on individuals of losing $40 in their paycheck, every paycheck, is real and harmful.\xc2\xa0 At this time where we\xe2\x80\x99re still in a fragile stage of our economic recovery where things are getting better but are far from good enough, the last thing Congress should do is, in an act of total disregard for a bipartisan consensus, total disregard for the effect it would have on 160 million people, refuse to vote on this compromise.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, John, it took me so long.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\xc2\xa0 It seems that the payroll tax cut is going to expire whether it\xe2\x80\x99s 10 days from now or two months or a year from now.\xc2\xa0 And you just spoke about the impact that it would have if it\xe2\x80\x99s not extended on middle-class families -- 160 million taxpayers out there.\xc2\xa0 Has the President or his economic team given any thought to making this payroll tax cut permanent?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because it was specifically -- it was specifically designed to -- a year ago, working with Republican leaders, designed to give the economy at that moment the boost that it needed and, again, notwithstanding those who choose to ignore basic economic facts and call themselves economists nevertheless, it has had a very positive impact this year on the economy, both on growth and job creation, and would continue to have that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Now, at some point, you hope that the recovery is at a stage where we would no longer need that added help.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is a one-year measure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Again, the debt ceiling -- the willingness to go through a debt ceiling showdown every three or six months I think makes clear that their concern about -- the stated concern about uncertainty is suspicious to say the least.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also -- Republicans overwhelmingly supported the temporary Bush tax cuts, right?\xc2\xa0 So this is a real-world impact.\xc2\xa0 This is not an esoteric exercise.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a political exercise.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bill that would either provide Americans with an extra $40 per paycheck or take it away.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t And Americans who live paycheck to paycheck and Americans who are doing a little bit better than that and saving a little bit will have to change their budgeting next year if the House walks away from this bipartisan compromise that 80 percent of Senate Republicans support but for some reason the House Republican leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President and the administration believes, then, that a year from now those taxpayers that you referenced will be able to handle that $40 hit in their paychecks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a lot of things that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of water to pass under the bridge economically between now and a year from now.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of -- as you know, reporting as you do on these issues -- a lot of other things that will have to be decided next year economically that will have potentially an effect on tax rates and a number of issues economically.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe would also certainly hope that the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not here making any kind of economic prediction about growth or anything except to say that we need to take the measures we can take to help the recovery along, to give it the kind of momentum that will lead to the kind of economic growth that will bring down the unemployment rate and put people back to work and eventually get us to a point where, yes, we would not need that kind of measure that we need now and that Americans need now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t All right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s shopping trip real quick?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got Bo, he\xe2\x80\x99s buying dog stuff, he\xe2\x80\x99s getting pizza and stuff.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the symbolism, what\xe2\x80\x99s the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m personally looking forward to a little of that pizza, having not had lunch.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What symbolism, if any, should we read into it?\xc2\xa0 Is the message that the dog is the President\xe2\x80\x99s best friend because it\xe2\x80\x99s Washington this time of year?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is the message that everyone should go out and spend -- is the message that everyone should go out and spend money before Christmas?\xc2\xa0 Is the message that -- is there no message and this is just the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to go shopping?\xc2\xa0 Or is the message that he can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done until Congress acts, so he might as well go shopping?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did buy a game that cost about $40.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s multiple choice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hashtag 40 --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t vote for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And an expensive chew toy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think Scott did my work for me there.\xc2\xa0 So -- no, the -- I would refer you to the pool report.\xc2\xa0 I was here as this OTR, as we call them, was happening.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously very busy here.\xc2\xa0 Shortly before making that excursion he was on the phone with Senator Reid and Speaker Boehner.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to get out of the house.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:46 P.M.
