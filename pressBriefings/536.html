EST</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 As you know, today we have the presentation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget.\xc2\xa0 For today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, as part of that introduction and presentation, I have with me the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Sylvia Burwell; I have Jason Furman, the Chairman of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers; Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz, the Director of the Domestic Policy Council; and Gene Sperling, the Director of the National Economic Council.</p>\n<p class="p2">Each of my guests will have an opening statement and then will take questions related to budget matters.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to direct traffic in that question and answer session.\xc2\xa0 I will have some time for a few questions at the end on other subjects -- and Ukraine obviously included.\xc2\xa0 But if you could hold questions on those subjects not related to the budget until after we\'re done with Q&amp;A on the budget that would be terrific.</p>\n<p class="p2">And with that, I turn it over to Sylvia.</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">The President\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 budget, which we released earlier today, is basically a fiscal road map for accelerating economic growth, expanding opportunity, and ensuring fiscal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 It includes fully paid-for investments in infrastructure, job training, preschool, and pro-work tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, it reduces deficits and strengthens our long-term fiscal outlook through additional health care reforms, tax reform, and by fixing our broken immigration system.</p>\n<p class="p2">We recognize the importance of the bipartisan funding compromise reached by the Congress, and the budget shows the President\xe2\x80\x99s funding priorities at the 2015 spending levels that were agreed to in the deal.\xc2\xa0 However, we believe those levels are not sufficient both in 2015 and beyond and to ensure the nation is achieving its fullest potential.</p>\n<p class="p2">For that reason, the budget includes an Opportunity, Growth and Security initiative that is fully paid for.\xc2\xa0 It\'s split evenly between defense and non-defense, and it presents additional investments in things like education, research, and manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 Building on the model established in Ryan-Murray, the initiative is fully paid for, with a balanced package of spending cuts and tax reforms, so it is deficit-neutral.</p>\n<p class="p2">Supporting what the President said in the State of the Union, the budget includes a series of measures to create jobs and accelerate growth in the economy.\xc2\xa0 For example, as the administration announced last week, the budget lays out an ambitious $302 billion infrastructure proposal that\'s paid for with the transition revenue from pro-growth business tax reform. It invests in American innovation and strengthens our manufacturing base by supporting the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of creating a national network of 45 manufacturing institutes.\xc2\xa0 It supports groundbreaking research to fight disease, protect the environment, and develop new technologies.\xc2\xa0 And it enhances the administration\xe2\x80\x99s management efforts to deliver a government that is more effective, efficient, and supportive of economic growth.</p>\n<p class="p2">The budget also includes measures designed to expand opportunity for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 For example, as Gene will discuss, it doubles the maximum value of the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless workers to build on the EITC\xe2\x80\x99s success in encouraging people to enter the workforce and reduce poverty.\xc2\xa0 It invests in the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision of making access to high-quality preschool available to every 4-year-old.\xc2\xa0 And it invests in new efforts to drive greater performance and innovation in workforce training.</p>\n<p class="p2">To ensure the nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-term fiscal strength, the budget focuses on what are the primary drivers of long-term debt and deficits, particularly health care cost growth and inadequate revenues to meet the needs of our aging population.\xc2\xa0 It builds on the reforms of the Affordable Care Act with another $400 billion in health care savings, continuing to slow health care cost growth while improving the quality of health care.\xc2\xa0 It curbs inefficient tax breaks that benefit the wealthiest and ensures that everyone is paying their fair share.</p>\n<p class="p2">It also calls for pro-growth immigration reform, which we know would not only promote economic growth but help with the deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Under the President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, the deficit has already been cut in half as a share of the economy.\xc2\xa0 By paying for the new investments and tackling our true fiscal challenges, the budget continues our progress, reducing deficits as a share of GDP to 1.6 percent by 2024 -- and with regard to the issue of stabilizing our debt-to-GDP ratio, that occurs in 2015, and then we start a declining path.</p>\n<p class="p3">The budget shows the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for moving the country forward.\xc2\xa0 It provides a responsible, balanced, and concrete plan that can serve as a guide for Congress in its work in the upcoming year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 My role is to present the economic forecast that underpins the budget.\xc2\xa0 The administration projects that economic growth will strengthen over the next several years, as the economy continues to return to the full utilization of all its resources.\xc2\xa0 The ongoing recovery will be aided by several factors:\xc2\xa0 The overall shift of fiscal policy towards a more neutral stance; progress in household deleveraging, including gains in housing and stock market wealth; and further potential for homebuilding.</p>\n<p class="p2">This near-term recovery is consistent with CBO, which projects a similar pace in growth over the next three years.\xc2\xa0 We assume that the growth rate converges to our projected 2.3 percent growth rate of potential GDP.\xc2\xa0 This, too, is generally consistent with other forecasters, coming in slightly lower than the latest long-run forecast by the Blue Chip Panel of Professional Forecasters, in the middle of the range of the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s central tendency, and slightly above CBO\xe2\x80\x99s longer-run projection.\xc2\xa0 We also project that inflation will remain low, that the unemployment rate will continue to fall over the next several years, and that interest rates will rise as the economy continues its recovery.</p>\n<p class="p2">Finally, I want to note that the forecast was locked in late November in order to give agencies time to prepare their budget estimates.\xc2\xa0 In the three and a half months since then, the economy has strengthened more than most forecasters expected.\xc2\xa0 GDP in the second half of 2013 grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate, exceeding the 2.3 percent forecasted by the Blue Chip at the time.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, the unemployment rate has fallen 0.6 percentage points since the forecast was completed, exceeding the decline expected by the Blue Chip, and that is as a result of increased employment with a participation rate ticking up over that period.</p>\n<p class="p2">As a consequence, if we were doing the forecast today, we would be projecting a higher starting-off point for real GDP in 2014 and a lower unemployment rate in 2014.\xc2\xa0 Overall, however, these changes would likely have only a small impact on the medium-term budget outlook.\xc2\xa0 We will, of course, have a fully updated economic and budget projection in the Midsession Review this summer that will incorporate both the positive and negative surprises since the budget forecast was finalized.</p>\n<p class="p2">And with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to Cecilia.</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jason.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise anyone in the room to hear that for the President, providing opportunity for all starts with ensuring that every child in America has access to a world-class education.\xc2\xa0 And this budget reflects investments that run the spectrum from the early childhood space to higher education, starting with restating the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision to bring high-quality preschool to all 4-year-olds in this country.\xc2\xa0 And as a down payment on that vision, the budget includes a $500 million request, which is double the amount proposed in the 2014 budget, for preschool development grants to help states and cities get started in enhancing and expanding their preschool programs.</p>\n<p class="p2">The preschool initiative is paired with a $650 million initiative to support early Head Start childcare partnerships that will boost the supply of high-quality infant and toddler care for 100,000 children.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This budget also proposes a new Race to the Top for America\xe2\x80\x99s schools, which is a $300 million program to incentivize states and school districts to adopt a comprehensive approach on closing opportunity and achievement gaps.\xc2\xa0 And the budget also includes the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for high school redesign, an initiative to encourage school districts and their partners to rethink what happens in high school, prioritize innovation, project-based learning opportunities that are tied to real-world experiences.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a $200 million investment for what we call Connect Educators, which is a professional development initiative tied to our ConnectED initiative, which is aimed at helping teachers use technology in classrooms effectively.</p>\n<p class="p2">The budget also reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision with respect to higher education, particularly with a focus on access, affordability, and completion.\xc2\xa0 That includes fully funding Pell grants, launching a competitive state higher education performance fund to drive systemic reform across the public higher education, and also supporting innovation through a \xe2\x80\x9cFirst in the World\xe2\x80\x9d program, which would reward colleges and universities specifically for taking on innovative strategies to drive down the cost and drive up quality.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So I know that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have time for questions on a range of other issues, but I want to flag one additional issue outside of the education space.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Opportunity, Growth and Security initiative.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an innovative piece of work.\xc2\xa0 We call it the Climate Resilience Fund.\xc2\xa0 The President spoke about it in his recent trip to California.\xc2\xa0 And I draw your attention to it again because we take very seriously our partnership with state, local and tribal governments who are engaged now in deliberate work to prepare and coordinate planning for the impacts of climate change, including the extreme weather conditions which many parts of the country have been experiencing.</p>\n<p class="p2">So this is a Climate Resilience Fund.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a billion-dollar investment in these efforts.\xc2\xa0 It includes investing in research and unlocking data, and helping communities plan and prepare, and funding breakthrough technologies and resilient infrastructure that will help communities across the country better prepare for the effects of climate change.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So, with that, let me turn to my colleague, Gene Sperling.\xc2\xa0 I should just say this is a guy who has dedicated his career to fostering growth and opportunity for all Americans, and he will be greatly missed when he returns to his family in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Cecilia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">This is a pro-growth and pro-opportunity budget, for the reason Sylvia said.\xc2\xa0 It, one, creates more demand and job growth in the outset when we need it.\xc2\xa0 It makes more room in the domestic discretionary budget for the things that invest in our future in growth and productivity and fairness.\xc2\xa0 And it focuses the debt reduction in the long-term where it will be most important for long-term confidence.</p>\n<p class="p2">But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a pro-growth and pro-opportunity budget because it has very sound, evidence-driven initiatives that should be alive for consideration by those who want to work together for economic growth -- some of the ones that Cecilia just mentioned, high school redesign, but let me just mention three and we can come back.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">One is, as you saw, the President is putting forward another significant expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that you heard discussed that we put out some details yesterday on would be the first major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit for people without dependent children since 1993.\xc2\xa0 It would address so many policy issues that people have raised, from how to encourage younger people to -- encourage work, help people with disabilities get back into the workforce, and ensure that more people with the combination of the Earned Income Tax Credit and minimum wage don\xe2\x80\x99t work full-time and live in poverty or raise any family members in poverty.</p>\n<p class="p2">This is an important progression.\xc2\xa0 Twenty years ago, there were 1.4 million Americans being pulled out of poverty because of the Earned Income Tax Credit or similar refundable tax credits.\xc2\xa0 Today, it is 10 million.\xc2\xa0 That is one of the major progressive achievements in which the President has furthered both in his 2009 budget and then extending those refundable tax credits in both 2010 and 2012 up for the next five years, and he calls for them to be permanent in his budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What this would do is it would double the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless adults.\xc2\xa0 It would both increase the amount; it would keep the phase-in longer, so people up to $18,000 would be eligible for this.\xc2\xa0 In terms of impact, 13.5 million Americans would benefit from this -- 5.8 million new Americans, and 7.7 million would get a deeper Earned Income Tax Credit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Let me give you one specific example.\xc2\xa0 If you are right at the poverty line for an individual, right at the poverty line -- that\xe2\x80\x99s $11,670 -- under the current Earned Income Tax Credit, you would get a $239 EITC.\xc2\xa0 Under the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, you would get $974.\xc2\xa0 It would be four times larger for an individual right at the poverty level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This is something -- this is a concept that has bipartisan support, and for those who are serious about not just talking the talk but walking the walk on reducing poverty and helping low-income working families, they should support the President\xe2\x80\x99s initiative on the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>\n<p class="p2">Secondly, the President has put forward a job compromise on corporate tax reform and infrastructure in which he puts out greater details here.\xc2\xa0 His corporate tax reform has the same elements.\xc2\xa0 It is still revenue-neutral.\xc2\xa0 It goes to a 28 percent rate -- 25 percent for manufacturing -- has a minimum tax, and is revenue-neutral in the long term.\xc2\xa0 But it has $150 billion in temporary, one-time revenues that come in.\xc2\xa0 And what the President suggests doing with that $150 billion is putting it towards the highway and transportation reauthorization -- $63 billion to close the existing financing gap, the hole that exists right now because the gas tax doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cover everything, plus an additional $87 billion that would allow virtually $22 billion more a year for jobs, fixing things first, deferred maintenance, investments in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This is, again -- this should be the type of proposal that is alive for discussion.\xc2\xa0 Chairman Camp, actually, in his tax reform proposal, devoted a similar amount of resources in the first 10 years to highway reauthorization.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is an idea that should be alive and well.</p>\n<p class="p2">And third, in addition to the proposal Cecilia mentioned, the President puts forward in here on the job-driven skills agenda -- the job-driven skills agenda, the skills needed to get people the jobs that are open, that they need that will be open. The proposals here are based on solid evidence and they have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a $4 billion initiative on community college innovation; $2 billion on apprenticeship fund; a reemployment plan -- $2 billion for \xe2\x80\x9cBridge to Work\xe2\x80\x9d to make sure that while people are unemployed they can have a chance to connect to a job and still have basic labor protections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Third, dislocated workers and long-term unemployment -- we do reform.\xc2\xa0 The President reforms together the trade adjustment program and the existing dislocated worker program into one program that\xe2\x80\x99s simple and clear and reformed and accountable.\xc2\xa0 But in doing that, he would increase from 533,000 to over a million the people who could get more intensive services as they try to find a new job and a $4 billion fund for public/private partnerships for the long-term unemployed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And then, finally, initiatives that would give employers subsidies and help if they hired youth that are disadvantaged, or people in -- particularly face high unemployment rates.\xc2\xa0 Those are Native Americans; those from disadvantages; those with serious disabilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This is, again, a common-sense agenda.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people talking the talk here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re for a reform agenda, but reform can bring forth more resources to be used well.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll now go to questions for our participants today.\xc2\xa0 Start with Cheryl.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Jason, on economic assumptions, CBO is predicting a slower, 2 percent growth after 2018 from retiring Baby Boomers and a slack labor market.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 I would describe our forecast as broadly in the same neighborhood as CBO\xe2\x80\x99s, and the difference between the two forecasts is much smaller than the uncertainty that both CBO and the administration face in projecting future economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">If you look over the next three years, we\xe2\x80\x99re both projecting an average annual growth rate of 3.3 percent.\xc2\xa0 After that, as you said, CBO is below us in terms of potential growth rate.\xc2\xa0 The Blue Chip forecast -- and their most recent long-run forecast was done in October -- is above us; they\xe2\x80\x99re at 2.4 percent.\xc2\xa0 The Federal Reserve is at 2.2 to 2.4.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re right in the middle of that at 2.3.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a range.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as I said, the differences between all of those are much smaller than the uncertainty all of us face.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Next question.\xc2\xa0 Zach.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for anyone.\xc2\xa0 The budget notes that discretionary spending, even as a (inaudible) was at the lowest rate in 50 years.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you consider that an achievement or a failure.</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 I think what we think is that the proposed President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is the right level over the 10-year period and that we believe that those levels are the correct level.\xc2\xa0 I think it is an argument for why the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, as proposed, and the levels that we proposed both in discretionary spending and other levels, are the right levels.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You list discretionary spending totals for all the departments.\xc2\xa0 Do those totals include Opportunity, Growth, and Security Fund dollars, or are those not included in the discretionary?</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 Those are not included.\xc2\xa0 So the totals that you see in terms of the departmental totals are each what we would do under meeting the 15 levels of the Ryan-Murray agreement.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of debate and discussion about whether the Affordable Care Act is bankable savings in health care costs over the long term, can you just describe how you calculated in the budget the long-term effects of the ACA in health care costs in terms of deficits or building it in for a 10-year reduction --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Those estimates are done by CMS working with OMB, so they\xe2\x80\x99re not estimates I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you from the analysis that we have done at the Council of Economic Advisers, which is consistent with the way that both CBO and the administration have updated their baselines for out-year health costs, has been observing that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen three years in a row of very low health growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">If you look on a per beneficiary inflation adjusted basis, Medicare growth has been 0.0 percent and Medicaid has actually fallen -- that the economy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a substantial impact on Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 So some people debated whether or not the recession caused the slowdown.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would argue that that\xe2\x80\x99s the major cause of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Medicare.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a combination of policies in the Affordable Care Act that have helped reduce the cost and increase the quality, as well as underlying structural changes in the health system.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen both the actuaries and their independent out-year projections for national health expenditures.\xc2\xa0 CBO and the administration all assume that a lot of those effects will continue and result in lower spending in the future than was originally projected.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you say -- because CBO was projecting a deficit at 4 percent of GDP, by 2024 of 1.6, how much of the health care calculations factor into that differential?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The biggest difference between those two is policy.\xc2\xa0 You just quoted the CBO number, which assumes no policy. The President\xe2\x80\x99s policies would reduce the deficit by 1.8 percent of GDP in the last year of the budget window.\xc2\xa0 And as a result, obviously the deficit is a lot better with deficit reduction, which is what we are showing in our budget, than if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have deficit reduction, which is what a budget baseline would show.\xc2\xa0 There are some other technical differences between our out-year forecasts -- they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly on the revenue side, though, not on the spending side.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you\xe2\x80\x99re including ACA?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, both of us include ACA because it\xe2\x80\x99s the law of the land.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for anyone.\xc2\xa0 Do any of the budget\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions about tax revisions vary from current law, apart from the EITC?\xc2\xa0 Like maybe certain expired tax provisions or extenders?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we have a set of proposals in there so one of the places that\xe2\x80\x99s assumed in our budget is that in the 2010 and 2012 budgets the President extended his increases for the refundability in the Child Tax Credit, the increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit for families with three children or more, and the marriage penalty.\xc2\xa0 And one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s innovations in his American Opportunity Tax Credit was that a portion of that was also refundable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">In the budget agreement, those were extended for another five years, through 2017.\xc2\xa0 We would assume that those are extended permanently.\xc2\xa0 We believe very strongly in that.\xc2\xa0 If those were to expire, those would be a significant tax increase in those years for well over 20 million low-income working households.</p>\n<p class="p2">We obviously have a range of tax proposals in our budget; many of them have been there before.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of new ones.\xc2\xa0 One of the ways that we pay for the Earned Income Tax Credit is to close a loophole where people in pass-throughs who are materially involved, who actually work there, may try to take their income as business investment as a way of avoiding payroll tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that\xe2\x80\x99s often been proposed.\xc2\xa0 That becomes a significant way, together with carried interest, of paying for the Earned Income Tax Credit increase.\xc2\xa0 So that is a deficit-neutral way that we could provide that help to 13.5 million hardworking Americans and do so in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s revenue-neutral and which I think we would consider we would be closing existing loopholes as opposed to, in those cases, really adding any new taxes there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">But, of course, it includes the basic provisions the President has had the last few year that would be part of his vision that Sylvia described of a balanced agreement both in terms of reducing expenditures for high-income individuals and closing loopholes for overseas tax evasion and other measures.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, what do you say -- and this is for Sylvia, primarily -- what would you say to Democrats on the Hill and federal employees who complain that the 1 percent pay increase is not enough coming off of a three-year pay freeze and also a pay raise that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep pace with inflation?</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 I would respond with, first, the importance of our federal employees and our federal workforce, and the respect that the administration has for that and the recognition that it has been a challenging number of years.\xc2\xa0 As you and I have discussed, certainly at OMB, which has a large number of career staff, we have felt that deeply.</p>\n<p class="p2">The second thing I would say is that there are provisions that were in previous budgets that no longer are with regard to the relationship to federal employee pensions, and that we are pleased that we can do the 1 percent.</p>\n<p class="p3">The last thing that I would say is the budget levels, the \xe2\x80\x9914 and \xe2\x80\x9915 budget levels that were agreed upon in Ryan-Murray, when one compares the \xe2\x80\x9915 level to the \xe2\x80\x9914 level, they are about basically the same.\xc2\xa0 And so when you account for things that have natural growth, such as veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits on the non-defense discretionary side, you see how tight the numbers are to produce a \xe2\x80\x9915 budget.\xc2\xa0 We, the administration, get the opportunity to do this first.\xc2\xa0 The Congress will do it next.\xc2\xa0 But people will start to know how tight the numbers are.</p>\n<p class="p3">And in that context, there are puts and takes that have to be made, and tradeoffs at flat levels, and we believe that our federal employees were something that deserved an increase.\xc2\xa0 The 1 percent increase is what we felt we were able to do in the context of the budget constraints.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you discuss the provision for training and development for federal employees and how that fits in with overall efforts to reduce spending on conferences and travel?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- in terms of the relationship between the two things, the Office of Management and Budget, together with GSA and others, have been a part of trying to reduce conference spending and that has occurred over the past several years.</p>\n<p class="p3">With regard to the issue of training and our federal workforce, as part of thinking about how the overall government does better management, you will see articulated in the budget volumes -- you will see a discussion of four major areas of emphasis that are about where we want to build on the management efforts of the first administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Those areas are in:\xc2\xa0 Effectiveness -- and that means serving our customers, the citizen and business as well.\xc2\xa0 Efficiency -- that means using the taxpayer dollar best.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s things like shared services, where you\xe2\x80\x99ll see HUD -- the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- actually using some of the services that are best done at Treasury in terms of financial services because they are the best providers, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do shared services where best.</p>\n<p class="p3">The third area is making sure that we promote management of the government that promotes economic growth.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s permitting, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve had -- I think everyone knows here\xe2\x80\x99s some of the permitting efforts.</p>\n<p class="p3">The fourth area -- and this comes to the training -- is people, and the belief that as one thinks about an agenda for management, we need to think about how we think about helping our workforce be the best that it can possibly be.\xc2\xa0 And so there are investments that we are doing in training the federal workforce. And so that\xe2\x80\x99s how that piece fits into the broader picture.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We don\xe2\x80\x99t consider it related to the conference part.\xc2\xa0 We consider this piece a part of a broader overall management agenda that emphasizes one of the pieces of that, focusing on the federal workforce in terms of trying to have a workforce that is able to deliver on the other three.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the balance between tax cuts and infrastructure jobs in that the Congressional Research Service Report said that direct jobs are four times as effective as tax cuts in creating jobs, and CBO reported that the American Jobs Act would have created 1 to 2 million jobs and dropped unemployment by a percent -- so why the value of tax cuts versus direct infrastructure jobs?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 A lot of our focus in this budget isn\xe2\x80\x99t on short-run support for aggregate demand and the types of multipliers you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but on how to best expand the productive capacity of the economy.\xc2\xa0 In that respect, infrastructure is a very important investment.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a one-year plan.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s four years sustained together with reforms and how that money is spent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">On the revenue side, one of the most important things for growth isn\xe2\x80\x99t something that costs any money or raises any money; it\xe2\x80\x99s what is neutral over the medium and long term reform of the business tax system.\xc2\xa0 It will generate money in the short run to invest in infrastructure, but it will also help simplify the tax system and ensure that capital is being allocated to its highest rate of return.</p>\n<p class="p2">Finally, there\xe2\x80\x99s other revenue measures that include, for example, higher revenue from high-income households by cutting back on their tax expenditures.\xc2\xa0 Those are part of that balanced approach to deficit reduction that Sylvia talked about to help ensure that the economic plan is sustainable over the medium and long run.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene, I wondered if as a parting gift to all of us who have been covering you for a while you\xe2\x80\x99d give us your most candid assessment of when you think the next round of budget negotiations to take us beyond the most recent Ryan-Murray deal are going to take place.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take place this year.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that that will happen next year? Or is that something for the next --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait until Thursday to ask him that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 I think that what you see in the vision of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward -- and it goes to Zach\xe2\x80\x99s question a little bit as well -- is that a lot of what is most important for growth and opportunity is not just going to be what the level of deficit reduction is, but the composition of how we get there.\xc2\xa0 And the vision of bringing the deficit down on a sustainable pace for the long term was partly to make sure that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t crowding out private investment, but it was always designed to make sure that we also weren\xe2\x80\x99t crowding out the public investment in the future.</p>\n<p class="p2">And if you let the budget go at the levels it has with the sequester, your deficit goes down -- it helps it go down, but it does so at the expense of crowding out the investments in the things the President and many people believe are most critical for the future.\xc2\xa0 You may not have the greatest constituency for the people who will be cured by cancer, by unknown NIH investments, or the families that will be better because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got early childhood education, but I think that what you saw in Ryan-Murray, and I think what you see in the President\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity agenda is really to say that we have to have a very important discussion about what is the composition of our budget in terms of how much we continue to invest in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And the reason why the President is making the statement of putting that extra $56 billion above and fighting for that is he\xe2\x80\x99s recognizing that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the level, it\xe2\x80\x99s the composition, and whether that includes what\xe2\x80\x99s always made us great, which is not just responding to the constituencies of the present, but investing in the young people and the productivity of the future.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping that conversation going.\xc2\xa0 And I think my hope is that people on both sides of the aisle will realize the importance of that going forward.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Six hundred and fifty billion in new revenue, higher taxes -- can you talk about who is going to feel that pain?\xc2\xa0 Who is going to be spending more money if that part of the budget were put into place?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jason answer, too, and Sylvia, if they choose -- but, first of all, you do have in this budget, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen tax relief for hard-pressed working families; that will be continued, expanded for individuals who may not have dependents like in the Earned Income Tax Credit.\xc2\xa0 There is a proposal to increase the dependent care credit for people who have a child five years and under, make sure that the American Opportunity Tax Credit -- so the relief here goes very much to working families.</p>\n<p class="p2">And in terms of where the revenues are, they are, we think, reasonable efforts to reduce the degree of tax expenditures and loopholes for people who are the most fortunate.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no proposal here to raise rates.\xc2\xa0 But I think that there is a question that I think many people have raised in tax reform on both sides, which is whether a middle-income family should be getting a 15 percent deduction or credits when they do things, and then somebody who has significantly more income can deduct three times more than that.\xc2\xa0 We may think of that as being a little upside down.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to have there be a limit on tax expenditures for the most well-off raises the most significant part of revenue in this proposal.\xc2\xa0 The President has long proposed that.\xc2\xa0 If you can remember back to the winter of 2012, the Speaker of the House was suggesting that one could raise almost a trillion dollars through that type of tax reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I think this will be -- as always, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budgets would make our tax code more fair, more progressive, would do better for people who want to invest in their future, in college, for people trying to get up the ladder, and ask a little more from some of the most fortunate families -- simply because a budget, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, is about tough choices and it\xe2\x80\x99s about how we invest the future in a way that is also good for growth and good for productivity, that ends up benefitting everyone, including those who might have a few less tax expenditures or tax avoidance techniques at their disposal.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. FURMAN:\xc2\xa0 The only two very brief things I\xe2\x80\x99d add to that is the bulk of that revenue is from limiting the value to 28 percent, as Gene said.\xc2\xa0 That would affect the top 1 or 2 percent of taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s very consistent with the spirit of proposals by a range of economists on both sides of the aisle, including leading Republican economists like Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, and Marty Feldstein, all of whom have talked about limiting the value of tax benefits for high-income\xc2\xa0 -- or for households as a way to address the deficit.</p>\n<p class="p2">And then the second-biggest source of that revenue is the Buffett Rule, which is only on households over a $1 million a year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely some new proposals in here, but a lot of them we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen before. How do you gin up interest and consideration in a divided Congress during an election year in some things that they feel like they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many times before?</p>\n<p class="p2">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 I think that question kind of has two parts to it.\xc2\xa0 One is the question of what\xe2\x80\x99s new in the budget, and the other is, is how do you work to move the ball forward on a number of things.\xc2\xa0 And on the question of what\xe2\x80\x99s new, there are a number of things -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the infrastructure and pro-growth tax that we\xe2\x80\x99ve brought together in a way is something new.\xc2\xa0 We actually saw this past week a Republican bringing forth in the Camp tax plan, we saw that approach.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something in terms of that\xe2\x80\x99s something new, but indicative of bipartisan support.</p>\n<p class="p2">The EITC that Gene mentioned is something else for the childless workers that\xe2\x80\x99s new.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Republicans, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Ryan or Rubio, discuss.\xc2\xa0 And so that is something new.\xc2\xa0 It is work-based.\xc2\xa0 People emphasize it because it is about work.</p>\n<p class="p2">The Opportunity, Growth and Security initiative is something else that I would put in the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d category as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are a number of places where there are the new things, while we continue on the overall themes, and a number of things that we think are important.</p>\n<p class="p2">But one of the things I think is also important to recognize in terms of your question of, okay, so what does this mean for getting something done, is I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reflect actually on the omnibus, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people had a lot of opportunity or chance to spend time on actually what happened in the omnibus.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the omnibus and you look at things like TIGER grants, an administration proposal from last year, you saw double-digit percentage increases from sequester.\xc2\xa0 You saw language actually being put into the omnibus that will afford us to the opportunity to start making progress on some of the things that Cecilia mentioned with regards to states\xe2\x80\x99 ability to start providing universal preschool.</p>\n<p class="p2">And so what will happen now is this budget I think is in a place -- we have proposed what we would do in terms of the choices at a \xe2\x80\x9915 level.\xc2\xa0 And now making sure that, like last year, this budget influences the choices that are going to be made throughout the appropriation process, as well as informs the conversation and debate that I think is related to John\xe2\x80\x99s earlier question.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are two very important things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to construct a budget and is going to represent the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision for both of those things.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just add one thing, too.\xc2\xa0 There are some things that have been in the budget that weren\xe2\x80\x99t passed but they were never rejected.\xc2\xa0 They may not have gotten the attention, but their issues are getting more attention now.\xc2\xa0 The high school redesign proposal is making the cover of national news magazines. There is increasing support by the Business Roundtable and Business Council for those proposals.\xc2\xa0 So while it may not have been accepted before, there may be more attention.</p>\n<p class="p2">The proposals for more job-driven training -- we had a debate over UI, has not so far gone the way we wanted, but we saw a lot of Republicans talking for the first time about how you can connect community colleges, apprenticeships; how we should deal with long-term unemployment.\xc2\xa0 So some proposals -- the long-term unemployment fund, the $4 billion fund there, the $2 billion in apprenticeship -- those are new proposals that are in this budget.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s other things in the skills part that were never rejected but where there\xe2\x80\x99s a greater focus on them now and, hopefully, if people are fair-minded and open, greater receptivity as well.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- corporate tax reform and temporary one-time revenues that will come in under this budget.\xc2\xa0 How would you see U.S. companies\xe2\x80\x99 foreign operations and overseas investments being affected by this?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. SPERLING:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that there is overwhelming support, I believe, for the combination -- among job creators, I think there is very great support for the combination of a new business tax reform as well as for more infrastructure investment.\xc2\xa0 Infrastructure investment does not seem like a controversial issue when you hear from people who actually make decisions of where to create and locate jobs in the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to reduce expenditures have a lower rate -- as low as 28 percent, or 25 percent for manufacturing, in the United States; have a minimum tax on foreign earnings that would take away significant incentives to play the various \xe2\x80\x9cshifting profits around the world\xe2\x80\x9d game that goes on right now and hurts public trust and also takes away a lot of activity that should be focused more on adding value and adding jobs.</p>\n<p class="p3">And I think that most people, they understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s provisions like accelerated depreciation that are going to have higher savings; that there\xe2\x80\x99s usually a transition adjustment that\xe2\x80\x99s made when you\xe2\x80\x99re going to a new system.\xc2\xa0 So I think most people understand the issue that there are revenues that come in in the first 10 years that are not sustainable; you can\xe2\x80\x99t use them to lower rates further because they\xe2\x80\x99re more one-time.\xc2\xa0 And I think the idea of that being used for infrastructure investment, which has such wide support, is one that is ripe, whose time has come.\xc2\xa0 And I think the fact that Chairman Camp decided to take the same approach should be a positive sign that this is an area, business tax reform and infrastructure, that we as a country should come together on.\xc2\xa0 Whether we do or not, I won\xe2\x80\x99t try to predict, but we should.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would like to ask a question when you get to Ukraine, about the situation over there.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 After this --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 Well, okay.\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t there kind of a budget question here also in that there are Republicans who are saying that the administration should reexamine how much is allocated in the defense budget because of the situation in Ukraine, and has the administration given any consideration to that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 First, I would start with -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it from a defense budget perspective, and then Jay can handle beyond.\xc2\xa0 First, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to reflect that there is an agreement, a Ryan-Murray agreement, that set the levels for \xe2\x80\x9915. In the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that you see proposed today, you see the President suggesting that the 050 account, which is Defense Department plus other things that do national security -- the Opportunity, Growth and Security initiative suggests that we believe a better place would be to have an additional $28 billion in that fully paid for, fully paid for; that we should make choices about offsets that have to do with closing tax loopholes and other things.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s choice that we should make.</p>\n<p class="p3">I would also reflect that in all the out-years of the budget, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget has higher levels of defense spending than those that are in current law and those that have been supported.\xc2\xa0 And that is what I think we will most likely see when we see proposals as they come out.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I guess I would start from -- the starting point is, great, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we all sign on to the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget in terms of getting our defense funding to the higher levels that we believe are the appropriate levels.</p>\n<p class="p3">Second, I would say, as Secretary Hagel pointed to and General Dempsey has pointed to, please give us the flexibility to do what we need to do to manage so that we can make sure we modernize our force, we provide the training and the readiness we need.</p>\n<p class="p3">And the third point that they both consistently made is, please give us the certainty.\xc2\xa0 Because the defense budget is a five-year defense planning window that has to with how we do acquisitions of equipment, it also has to do with what proportion of the entire defense budget has to do with people, and so giving us certainty is the other thing.</p>\n<p class="p3">So I think my response is the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is at higher levels.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s where we need to go.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful that, as we said kind of coming back to the question of what will the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget do and influence, we believe these are the right levels.\xc2\xa0 We believe that what we should be doing is in the out-years buying back both on the non-defense discretionary side and the defense side, that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t operate at the lower levels that are the sequester levels.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the budget does.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the right place to go.</p>\n<p class="p3">Jay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you want to add.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just add that it merits examining the logic of the Republican critique that you mentioned, which on the one hand, says the President is spending too much, and on the other hand, says the cuts in defense are too deep, when the spending they are criticizing goes fully half to raising the levels of our defense budget.\xc2\xa0 So if Republicans are serious about that concern, they ought to support that initiative that would add another $26 billion to our defense budget.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Given the strong case you just made for increasing the defense budget by $26 billion, would accept the proposal that just did that -- had offsets, which were shared, but just increased the defense side and replacing sequestration -- increasing the size of the defense budget, and not do discretionary?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 The administration -- the budget as proposed does what the Ryan-Murray approach did, which is replacement in one-for-one defense and non-defense.\xc2\xa0 We believe that both are equally important.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Any others on budget-related?</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for Sylvia.\xc2\xa0 The budget talks about the IT procurement reform but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go into a lot of details.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of healthcare.gov and the problems associated with that website rollout, can you go into any more details in terms of what you\xe2\x80\x99re planning for IT procurement reform?\xc2\xa0 I know you talk about strategic sourcing and I know you talk about more efficiency and effectiveness, but is there any other details you can offer?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 Let me speak to three particular areas that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to focus on with regard to reforming the way that we in the federal government do both IT procurement and delivery.\xc2\xa0 And the three areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be focusing our attention on -- one, making sure that the government has the best people.\xc2\xa0 And I think as a part of the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had around healthcare.gov and how we think about procurement and how we think about planning in the space, making sure that we in the federal government are able to attract the best talent in the space.</p>\n<p class="p2">Second is how do we attract the best companies and the best companies in terms of the problems that we are working on, and do our current procurement rules and do our approaches do that?\xc2\xa0 And so, that\xe2\x80\x99s the second area of focus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The third area is the best processes.\xc2\xa0 And the best processes are both about how you attract -- these are all inter-related -- the companies that will be providing these services as well as the processes; how do we think through the federal acquisition processes and the decision-making processes that can make us get to better answers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So those are the three specific areas that we will be focusing on as we look in terms of -- you reference in the budget you see that and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work specifically in those three areas.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Climate Resilience Fund was mentioned.\xc2\xa0 How if at all does that relate to the broader Climate Action Plan and the energy initiatives in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. MU\xc3\x91OZ:\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a part of the overall effort.\xc2\xa0 The Climate Action Plan deals with the range of energy policies -- things like investments in clean energy, things like moving on greenhouse gas emissions, and also dealing with resilience in making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re being a good partner to state and local governments as they prepare for the impacts of climate change.</p>\n<p class="p3">So this is a piece of that significant investment, again, as I mentioned, both through FEMA to help state and local and tribal governments prepare, but also to include research data United Nations locking information that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be helpful in that process, and also building on our experience after Superstorm Sandy to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re investing in the right kinds of technologies that can help water systems, for example.\xc2\xa0 So there are multiple pieces of that.\xc2\xa0 We consider it part of the overall Climate Action Plan agenda. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Ryan-Murray deal for 2014 shows 1,012 in base discretionary spending.\xc2\xa0 But your budget shows 1,033 in base discretionary spending for 2014.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain that discrepancy?</p>\n<p class="p3">MS. BURWELL:\xc2\xa0 We build the budget and build it to the basic 1,014 -- the Ryan-Murray levels.\xc2\xa0 There are puts and takes that have different technical places.\xc2\xa0 For instance, our wildfire proposal that Cecilia mentioned and how we do the wildfire proposal would be one of the examples of why when you see those numbers in the budget, that\'s what you see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The wildfire proposal -- just to go over it briefly to give you an example of what kinds of puts and takes -- we believe that the issue of wildfire financing in the United States at this point in time is not being done in a way that is most cost-efficient and effective in terms of impact.\xc2\xa0 What happens is on an annual basis when the wildfires start, the Department of the Interior and the USDA end up hollowing out, and they hollow out the types of investments we need to make in efforts in the space. So what they do is they take money from other places.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t do planning and they take money from other places we should be investing.\xc2\xa0 What happens -- not always, but most of the time -- is those monies get replenished at a point in time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">What we think is a better approach is to think about how we use the Disaster Relief Fund and that we use that fund, which has levels above -- and so the fund is above the caps.\xc2\xa0 And what we will use is use space within that for a portion of funding of wildfires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the types of things that adds to those numbers.\xc2\xa0 So the budget is built, so when the appropriators look, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see how we get to those numbers.\xc2\xa0 There are things like that, which is a wildfire cap adjustment that is within authorized levels, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not increasing the authorized appropriations.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what happens in those numbers.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so I have time for a couple of questions on other subjects.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Could the United States accept Russia remaining in Crimea if there was no active fighting or if Russian forces didn\xe2\x80\x99t move into Eastern Ukraine?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States\xe2\x80\x99 position is that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty must not be violated and that military action taken by the Russian government is inappropriate and unlawful.\xc2\xa0 It is in violation of international law.\xc2\xa0 It is in violation of a number of international obligations that the Russian Federation has.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in violation of the 1994 Budapest Agreement that Russia signed on to.\xc2\xa0 So the answer to that is we do not find that -- or would not find that to be acceptable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I think that it is worth looking at what the President said earlier today, what Secretary Kerry said in Kyiv today, what Ambassador Power said yesterday at the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 The mobilization that we saw Russia undertake and the movement of troops that we saw Russia undertake, the closing of roads, the surrounding of military bases in Crimea was all done in response to an imaginary threat.\xc2\xa0 There is no credible reporting of violence against ethnic Russians in Ukraine -- Eastern Ukraine or Crimea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And the President made clear, and Secretary Kerry made clear, and Ambassador Power made clear that if there is an issue and if there is protection that needs to be provided to ethnic Russians in Eastern Ukraine, the proper and internationally lawful way to address those concerns is through international organizations -- through the OSCE, through the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 And the United States would fully support efforts, and would work with the Ukrainian government to support efforts, to provide monitors and other means of assuring the protection of the rights of Russian -- ethnic Russians in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">To fabricate a reason to invade a country or to use military mobilization along the lines that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Russia is just not legitimate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not lawful.</p>\n<p class="p3">Steve.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President secure an agreement from Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday to sign up to the framework for extending peace talks?\xc2\xa0 If you look at the public comments the President made to Jeffrey Goldberg and what the Prime Minister said in the Oval Office and in AIPAC, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like there\xe2\x80\x99s a meeting of the minds on that yet.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We continue to work very closely with the Israelis and the Palestinians on a framework for negotiations.\xc2\xa0 You saw what the President said prior to his meeting with the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what others, including Secretary Kerry, have said about the opportunity here to move forward, the necessity of a framework for negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And that effort continues.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yes, Mark.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s comment earlier today that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that the use of force is likely to be necessary in Crimea?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that we continue to monitor the situation in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine very closely.\xc2\xa0 We stand by very strongly our support for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity, for its sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 We strongly support the legitimacy of the new Ukrainian government, a government which has been very responsible in its handling of events of the last days.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, Secretary Kerry announced a package of support that we want Congress to work with us on very quickly so that we can complement IMF assistance, so that Ukraine and the new Ukrainian government can deal with the economic challenges it faces.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you saw President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s denying that those forces in Crimea are Russian.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House response to that?\xc2\xa0 And does the President believe he has an honest broker in Vladimir Putin when he is on the phone with him?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 President Obama has always been very clear-eyed about our relationship with Russia and our dealings with Russian government officials, including President Putin.\xc2\xa0 We work cooperatively when it is in our interests and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interests where those interests coincide, and achieve national security aims for the United States accordingly.\xc2\xa0 Where we have disagreements, we\xe2\x80\x99re very blunt about them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">This would be one.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that Russian military forces have taken over Ukrainian border posts.\xc2\xa0 It is a fact that Russia has surrounded or taken over practically all Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">It is a lot more difficult to advance a pretext or an imaginary threat, or a fabricated situation, and have that fabrication stand for very long in today\xe2\x80\x99s world.\xc2\xa0 It is patently obvious that the things Russian officials have been saying are happening in Ukraine are not happening.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we and you and everyone has means to verify that fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Our focus is on, obviously, making the point that Russia has an alternative path to dealing with whatever legitimate concerns Russia has about ethnic Russians and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s other interests in Ukraine, including Crimea.\xc2\xa0 We have long recognized that Russia has long, deep, cultural and historical ties as well as economic ties to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And it is our position that, while the Ukrainian people may choose to further integrate with Europe, they can do so while still maintaining strong cultural, historical and economic ties to Russia.\xc2\xa0 To do both is not contradictory.\xc2\xa0 And we urge Russia to utilize the paths legally available to it through international organizations to address the concerns they have about their interests and ethnic Russians in Ukraine.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said he saw something where Vladimir Putin had indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s pausing and reflecting.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s taking that from President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s comments?\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we all saw what President Putin said and the statements he made.\xc2\xa0 I think that was an observation about those statements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Just two more.\xc2\xa0 Jared and then Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the White House plan to issue any new directives that would allow health care insurers additional time to offer plans that don\xe2\x80\x99t currently meet ACA requirements?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any policy announcements regarding that at this time.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to HHS.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Alexis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that he\xe2\x80\x99d like Congress to take up the loan guarantee package as a first order of business.\xc2\xa0 Can you expand on any commitments that the President may have heard from the Hill about how soon that might happen and whether he had a chance to talk with any members of Congress?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any conversations between the President and members of Congress to report out.\xc2\xa0 I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s ample opportunity -- since so many members have been speaking about Ukraine for those they have been speaking to -- namely reporters -- to ask how soon they plan to act on a package of assistance to Ukraine, which would be an excellent use of their authority and time.</p>\n<p class="p2">Thank you very much.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t1:50 P.M.
