EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Happy Friday, the 13th.\xc2\xa0 I\'m glad you\'re all here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for inviting us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve done previously, Jen and I will be speaking together to save a little time.\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll talk about some of the policy aspects of the President\'s activities today, and Jen will have some comments on the President\'s political activities -- there are quite a few of them because this is largely a political trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne thing I want to do and I\xe2\x80\x99ll flag for you before we get started is -- in his remarks today, the President will highlight the need for Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would extend the Bush tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, those making less than $250,000 per year.\xc2\xa0 This will have a significant impact on families in Virginia, because if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act, 2.9 million families in Virginia would see their taxes go up by an average of $1,600 per year -- again, 2.9 million families in Virginia by an average of $1,600 a year if their taxes -- if Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t act.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, 2.9 million families?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tDemocrats in Congress have already articulated their strong support for this, and we\'re challenging Republicans, the self-styled party of lower taxes, to actually walk the walk and take advantage of this opportunity to act in bipartisan fashion to cut taxes for middle-class families and provide them some certainty going into next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tJen, I know you have some more.\xc2\xa0 You want to add to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two things I just wanted to highlight for you.\xc2\xa0 One is, as you all saw, Senator Warner and Governor Kaine are traveling with us today.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll be with us just today.\xc2\xa0 And they\'ll be at all of the events.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll be introducing at different events throughout the course of the day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second piece, just to add to what Josh said, is you\'ll also hear the President touch on the fact that this week Republicans in Congress voted 33 times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a piece of legislation that millions of families are already benefiting from, that three branches of government have said it is constitutional and that we\'re really focused on implementing.\xc2\xa0 And they didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote once on extending middle-class tax cuts for working families across this country, including many in Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe will also touch on the importance of taking care of military families, given the strong military presence in Virginia, and taking care of the people who serve.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ll hear him, as he has been doing over the last couple of weeks, lay out the contrast of the visions between what he is -- what he will fight for if he\'s given another four years in the White House, and Mitt Romney\'s vision for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can we start with the Syria -- the massacre in Syria, what\'s the White House reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen the reports overnight from further atrocities that have been perpetrated by the Assad regime against the Syrian people in a community outside Hama.\xc2\xa0 If there was any doubt before yesterday about the need for a coordinated international response at the United Nations, that doubt has been eliminated.</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough these repeated efforts, through these repeated acts of violence against the Syrian people, President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead.\xc2\xa0 It is time for him to go.\xc2\xa0 It is time for the political transition that is long overdue to finally get underway.\xc2\xa0 And we want -- we are hopeful that we\'ll see continued unity on the international scale to press Assad to leave power.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that increase the burden on Russia, then, to support the U.S. and Annan\'s plan and its efforts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly does build strong international support for -- to continue to ramp up the pressure on Assad, there\'s no doubt about that.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Jim, there are some ongoing conversations at the United Nations about additional ways that we can build some international agreement and raise the stakes even further.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t want to get ahead of any of those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President is going to have a military audience for a lot of what he says today.\xc2\xa0 Will he talk about the impact that the sequester would have on the Pentagon budget?\xc2\xa0 And what can he say about what he\'s doing to prevent those cuts from taking place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\'s pretty clear what the President has been doing.\xc2\xa0 For more -- at least in terms of his specific proposals, the President, last September, laid out a very detailed proposal about what he\'s willing to do in bipartisan fashion to take a balanced approach to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 He has been rebuffed repeatedly by Republicans who say they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise taxes on the wealthy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would remind you that the sequester was something that was actually passed with the strong support of Republicans, in both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for this is that it\xe2\x80\x99s an action-forcing mechanism to force Congress to confront the difficult budget challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNobody is in support of -- at least certainly the administration is not in support of the pretty significant cuts that have been proposed by the sequester, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes that we need to take action on a balanced approach to do something serious about our deficit challenges.\xc2\xa0 Not only is that good for this country over the long term, but it also would avert the cuts that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here that would have a pretty significant impact on local communities economically across the country, but also have an impact on our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will he mention it today?\xc2\xa0 And if --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I can address this.\xc2\xa0 So just to add to what Josh said, the President will talk about the importance of standing up for military families -- not just with the extension of middle-class tax cuts, but also in taking care of our veterans who return home.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn this topic, the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re in this situation is because Mitt Romney, congressional Republicans believe that putting -- making sure millionaires and billionaires have their tax cuts extended is more important and they\xe2\x80\x99re more focused on that than making sure middle-class military families have the security they need.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust a reminder -- Mitt Romney, as you know, supports the Ryan Budget.\xc2\xa0 The Ryan Budget, if there\xe2\x80\x99s across-the-board cuts, could include $11 billion in cuts to the VA that would have a dramatic impact on military families, especially those in Virginia.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also has talked about privatizing health care for the VA.\xc2\xa0 Those are areas where they should raise -- and I think do raise -- some serious concerns.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So wait, just to clarify -- I get that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about the tax cuts and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to talk about the other ways in which he has -- his policies have helped military veterans, but is he going to talk about the sequester today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No, he will talk about the importance of fighting for military families, standing up for them, how the middle-class tax cuts will help them, and what we need to do to continue to make sure they have the economic security moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the sequester, Leader Pelosi said in an interview yesterday that if Republicans accepted an extension of just the middle-class tax cuts then Democrats might be open to undoing parts of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the White House is open to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that, as I mentioned earlier, that the sequester is an action-forcing mechanism.\xc2\xa0 And he does believe that we should be focused on doing something serious to deal with our deficit challenges over the long term.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has laid out his view that a balanced approach is what is the wise course of action.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have blocked that because -- solely because they say that they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President believes that what we should do is we should move forward in a balanced way in which we deal with the long-term budgetary challenges that are posed by entitlements, that we can make some reforms to those programs that will strengthen them in the long term, that we can go ahead and implement the significant cuts that are already in place to government funding. We already have non-discretionary -- or discretionary, non-security government spending down to the lowest levels since the Eisenhower administration as a percentage of GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yes, we need to ask those at the top of the income scale to do more.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of balanced approach that we need to deal with all these challenges.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we can do to avert a sequester.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this compromise would be doing that, because it would be extending the middle-class tax cuts -- Republicans would agree to that, and then Democrats would have to agree to some tradeoff.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that there is no tradeoff that the administration would support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the President has been very clear about what he thinks we need to do to deal with the sequester, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate anything else from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that people that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to visit today need to see that the President is inviting Republicans over, figuring out how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to deal with the sequester, especially when it comes to defense mechanisms?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what the people of southern Virginia have seen is they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the President of the United States lay out a specific plan that would deal with our deficit challenges in a balanced way, in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine our national security and in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t undermine the economic strength of communities like those in southern Virginia that are heavily reliant on the defense industry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk about the alleged threat by the D.C. police officer mentioning Michelle Obama, and whether the President and the First Lady are aware of this threat and what kind of investigation is being conducted or asked for by the White House or the Secret Service?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 Any kind of investigation, if there is one, would be conducted by the Secret Service, so I\xe2\x80\x99d ask you to direct your questions to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of this investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he have anything to say about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, on Bain, today Romney has a new ad out that quotes the President from his Colorado convention speech, saying if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t that what the President is doing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, first I will say that as we know, overnight -- or last night, new information surfaced about Mitt Romney in reports -- about Mitt Romney returning back frequently to Massachusetts for meetings and participating in conference calls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the issue here is that there are serious questions that have been raised about what information has been public, what information has been released, and what the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 What the President has also said is that when you run for President, people deserve to know you are who you say you are -- that you\'re an open book, that they know where you\'re coming from, what your investments are.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the decision-making process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with Senator Reid saying that the Olympic uniforms should be burned because they were made in China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The thing that I would point out is the United States Olympic Committee has said that they are a -- they\'re privately funded.\xc2\xa0 So this isn\'t a government decision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\'s views on the high quality of American-made products is well known and something that he talks about quite extensively.\xc2\xa0 That includes American-made clothing; that there are high-quality products that are made here in America.\xc2\xa0 And maybe for future Olympics, those kinds of things will be considered.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I would say is, at the same time, the story shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t distract from the story of young Americans who are preparing to -- who have spent a good portion of their lives preparing to compete on the international stage.\xc2\xa0 These are people who dedicated their lives to honing their athletic ability, becoming experts at their craft.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re confident that when they go to compete on the international stage that they\'re going to represent this country very well.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully this story won\'t distract from --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but was the President annoyed when he heard about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask the President specifically about this story, but I can tell you that his views about the quality -- high-quality, American-made goods that are made by American workers in the United States of America is well known.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President insist on wearing American-made clothes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t checked the label on his wardrobe today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, did Stephanie Cutter go too far by suggesting that Mitt Romney is a -- might be a felon in the press call yesterday about the SEC filings, and the date of his employment at Bain?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, Amy, there have been many reports suggesting -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answers because Mitt Romney hasn\'t released not only his tax returns, he hasn\'t released documents around this.\xc2\xa0 Today, he could release his minutes from Bain -- from the Bain -- or they could release the minutes from the Bain meetings and we could learn more.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat was being raised here is something that was raised externally, which is we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 But if he did violate, if he did mislead the SEC, there could be -- that could raise questions, there could be legal questions that are raised about that.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not the ones who can answer that.\xc2\xa0 If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, then he was misleading the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we don\xe2\x80\x99t know is the answer to that question, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\'re eager to see more documents from Mitt Romney and his team.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the tax rates -- as you pointed out, Governor Kaine is here.\xc2\xa0 He has said that the threshold should actually be $500,000 on one year extended.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that demonstrate the lack of consensus on this issue on exactly where you define middle class, where you should draw that line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think, broadly speaking, there is strong agreement among Democrats in Congress about providing some measure of certainty for middle-class Americans in terms of their tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, where we\'ve seen consensus has actually been on the Republican side, who are basically threatening that kind of certainty, holding hostage tax cuts for middle-class families because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the consensus that we\'ve seen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Tim Kaine and Mark Warner be with you guys all day today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could we invite them back to speak to us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 From Hampton to Roanoke maybe?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re going to talk -- we\'ll talk to them about that.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Thank you guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:49 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
