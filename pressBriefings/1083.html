EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning, Jay.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 How are you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for coming on this trip.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President is going to visit New Jersey to view some of the sites that have been affected by Hurricane Irene, the flooding damages, and the recovery efforts underway.\xc2\xa0 He will be joined by FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, FEMA FCO Bill Vogel, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson, Governor Chris Christie, Senators Frank Lautenberg and Bob Menendez, Representative Bill Pascrell, Representative Steve Rothman, Paterson Mayor Jeffrey Jones, and Wayne Mayor Christopher Vergano, as well as Red Cross CEO and President Gail McGovern.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Associated Press.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why Paterson as opposed to some other place, maybe North Carolina or Vermont, that also had a lot of damage?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- a lot of affected areas, and so this is not a choice of lesser or more damage, it was simply this was a place he could visit that was -- had some particularly severe impacts, and the President looks forward to hearing from both his -- the federal response team as well as local officials about what happened on the ground and the response effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he make a statement to the press while he\xe2\x80\x99s on the ground or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe so, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Marty Nesbitt is on board.\xc2\xa0 Is that just because they\xe2\x80\x99re friends, or does he have a Paterson connection?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And jobs speech -- ready?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has spent certainly a part of the weekend putting the finishing touches on his proposals and the speech, and I think that that process continues over the next few days, but he\xe2\x80\x99s very far along.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Representative Walsh of Illinois says he won\xe2\x80\x99t attend, says it\xe2\x80\x99s too political in nature.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The idea that the President of the United States giving a speech about the need to grow the economy and create jobs is political -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you judge that for yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pull back the ozone regulations?\xc2\xa0 The President, as a candidate, talked about the importance of protecting clean air.\xc2\xa0 Does this show that that commitment might be wavering?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement; that suggestion, that question is ridiculous given all the amazing steps he has taken to ensure that we enforce the Clean Air Act, including steps on mercury, as well as historic standards for -- new standards for fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.\xc2\xa0 The President, as he said in his statement, had to look at the fact that the new standards are being reviewed and will be out 2013, on ozone, and that he did not feel at this time that it was wise to add to regular -- regulatory uncertainty.\xc2\xa0 So he asked the EPA administrator to withdraw that as we wait for new science and new standards.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Christie, will he be accompanying the President on all of the stops?\xc2\xa0 And does the President believe that some of Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s comments are the sort of bipartisanship that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear from Republicans in the last few days?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Governor will be with us today, but I\'ll double check that throughout the visit.\xc2\xa0 I think the broad point is that when disaster strikes, Americans suffer -- not Democrats, not independents, not Republicans -- Americans suffer, and that we come together and put politics aside to ensure that those Americans are -- get the assistance that they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about Louisiana, the tropical storm down there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are obviously monitoring that, concerned about the -- what will be -- has been and will be a significant amount of rainfall.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously in close contact with FEMA Administrator Fugate.\xc2\xa0 He is traveling with him today and he is providing him updates on that tropical storm.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any update on Libya or Syria that you can share with us?\xc2\xa0 Do you know where Qaddafi is?\xc2\xa0 Are there any conversations today with foreign leaders that the President is having that you can tell us about?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With regards to Libya, no in terms of conversations with foreign leaders that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I could get an update.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no change on our view that Colonel Qaddafi remains in Libya.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, there is no particularly new information to provide.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us anything about that jobs speech coming later this week, anything new?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think everyone understands that we are at a time in our economy when we need to do something.\xc2\xa0 We need to take action to spur growth and accelerate hiring.\xc2\xa0 The President will put forward a number of proposals that have historically enjoyed bipartisan support and will, without question, if enacted, positively affect growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe looks forward to Congress returning from its recess with the same sense of urgency that he feels about the need to take these kinds of measures and will call on Congress to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration making any progress with the Palestinians and the statehood U.N. vote issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The administration believes, as you know, that the Palestinians cannot achieve statehood through a U.N. mandate, that the only way to do that -- or U.N. vote.\xc2\xa0 The only way to do that is through direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And the administration has continued to urge both sides to negotiate a peace that will lead to Palestinian statehood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we see you again?\xc2\xa0 Will we see him, or is it going to be, like, statement on the run?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he will probably be standing still when he makes a statement.\xc2\xa0 But thanks, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:50 A.M.
