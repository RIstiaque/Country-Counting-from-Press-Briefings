Brady Press Briefing Room</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  1:46 P.M. EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got some time, Chuck.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Seriously.\xc2\xa0 Three times, you got to go to detention hall.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that the rule?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just saying.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 Chuck obviously has got somewhere to go, Liz.\xc2\xa0 <br/>  Let me do a quick week ahead for you.\xc2\xa0 I think most of you have a sense of where we\'re going to spend next week, but let\'s do it nonetheless.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Tomorrow the President will travel to Camp David.\xc2\xa0 He will remain there until Saturday, returning to the White House in the morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\'s not leaving -- I thought he was leaving today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It got changed.\xc2\xa0 He\'s leaving tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The White House will celebrate the Fourth of July on Saturday, obviously, and honor military heroes and their families with a barbecue on the South Lawn.\xc2\xa0 The evening will conclude with fireworks.\xc2\xa0 Twelve-hundred military families have been invited to attend.\xc2\xa0 The Marine Band will perform.\xc2\xa0 White House staff and their families have also been invited to watch fireworks on the South Lawn.\xc2\xa0 He will deliver brief remarks, which will be pooled press.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">As you all know, on Sunday night, the First Family will depart Washington, D.C., for Moscow.\xc2\xa0 They will arrive on Monday afternoon, remain in Moscow until Wednesday morning, when the President will depart for Rome and participate in G8 activities until Friday.\xc2\xa0 The President will depart Italy on Friday night for Ghana, remain in Ghana until Saturday night, when he will return to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And just as an FYI, when the President leaves for Camp David, he will go on Marine One from a different location because they are setting up for our activities here for the Fourth of July.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Ms. Sidoti.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President told the AP in an interview that he may not ever get comfortable with a prolonged detention.\xc2\xa0 So what would be the alternative to dealing with terrorism suspects?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the question was asked about how one might go about doing this and his perspective on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that is something that the interagency group is working on now.\xc2\xa0 No decisions have been made.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think it would be real productive to get into "what if" for decisions that have not fully or finally been made.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, he also said that the U.S. will keep the door open for North Korea to return to disarmament talks.\xc2\xa0 But doesn\'t the U.S. have to do more than provide the door?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t the U.S. have to prod them in some way or sanctions enough to get North Korea to come through that door?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is clear sanctions are having an impact.\xc2\xa0 I think as the President said in that interview, we\'ve gotten the cooperation of the Russians and the Chinese on those sanctions, sanctions many people thought would not come to fruition.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, look, I think, first and foremost, the administration is working to ensure the vigorous implementation of those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously -- they\'re put in place based on the concern of North Koreans trying to move weapons or material out of North Korea.\xc2\xa0 The vigorous implementation of those inspections is first and foremost.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and the P5-plus-1 continue to work to get the North Koreans to live up to the obligations and responsibilities that they themselves signed up for a few years ago, and we\'ll continue to do that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s nothing else beyond this to get them to walk through it, then.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know, we continue to watch the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 They continue to do and say what they do and say.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re certainly hopeful that they\'ll return to discussing this, but understanding that the international community is taking very strong action to deal with the situation in North Korea and to prevent weapons or material from leaving North Korea and going to anywhere else.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama announced on June 8 that the administration was accelerating stimulus spending to save or create 600,000 jobs.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. economy lost 467,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate went up to 9.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered what\'s the President\'s reaction to the higher unemployment rate, and are you concerned that the economy is losing steam faster than the Recovery Act can help it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take that question and address it on a couple of different levels.\xc2\xa0 I think you saw the President already say today, and he\'ll say it again later today, that obviously he\'s deeply disappointed by the continued job loss in our economy.\xc2\xa0 Continuing to lose jobs is something that he and the administration are working to address.\xc2\xa0 Understand that it has been 549 days since we have been in a month that has seen a net positive job creation.\xc2\xa0 I think -- though the President remains deeply concerned that we are losing jobs month to month, I do think if you look at some -- if you step back and look at the numbers through a quarterly basis, or as the Bureau of Labor Statistics did today, they looked at -- from November of 2008 through I believe March of 2009 -- the average job loss for those months approached 700,000.\xc2\xa0 In the most previous quarter, that job loss averaged 436,000.\xc2\xa0 So I think there is a sense that the beginnings of stabilization are taking hold and hopefully the worst job loss is behind us.</div> <div class="legacy-para">You all heard me say the second time I walked into this room that it was likely to get worse before it was going to get better.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think anybody believed, and we certainly never said, that a recovery plan in and of itself would solve our economic problems or that after only a hundred-some days it would turn an economy, as I said, that\'s been in the worst financial shape that we\'ve seen it in since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I do think there\'s obviously evidence that the recovery plan is working.\xc2\xa0 Last month personal incomes were up as a result of the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 But I think you\'ll hear the President say later today that he sees this economy through the eyes of the American people, and obviously the American people are continuing to hurt.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the government think it\'s doing everything it can do at this point to --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there\'s -- again, there\'s money in the recovery plan to deal with -- health and education money to states to plug those holes.\xc2\xa0 But understand that the recovery is just one aspect of it, as we\'ve talked about.\xc2\xa0 There is financial stabilization.\xc2\xa0 There\'s housing that you have to be -- there\'s a whole host of issues that the President and the administration are focused on in order to turn the economy around.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, just to follow up on that, is the message to the American people that the recovery, the stimulus, are working, just be patient?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, our message is we didn\'t get into this problem overnight, as the American people understand, and it\'s not likely we\'re going to get out of this economic problem overnight.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve said that repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 I said this weekend last we think unemployment will continue to grow.\xc2\xa0 We do see some less negative trends in the way unemployment is going, understanding we\'ve still got quite some ways to go.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At what point would that be?\xc2\xa0 I mean, when is it no longer overnight?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When is what no longer overnight?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said we didn\'t get into this problem overnight; we\'re not going to get out of it overnight.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Again --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how long can you still say "overnight"?\xc2\xa0 What\'s the time that we\'re talking here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think this is going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s going to take months and months.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve said that from the very beginning.\xc2\xa0 This is not, again, something that -- remember, the last month in which we created -- we net created jobs in this economy was December 2007.\xc2\xa0 So we understand that in his -- we are in the deepest recession since World War II, and the worst financial crisis, when you take into account the markets and housing, since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 That\'s going to take some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think there certainly is credible evidence -- there\'s 1,900 construction projects that are in progress.\xc2\xa0 There are -- there\'s $160 billion in recovery money that\'s been obligated to this point.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s going to make a difference.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different subject -- Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Now that so much of the focus now is being put on sort of the next front on the fight against terrorism there, does the President plan to sort of formally prepare the American people for the potential sacrifices there -- people being kidnapped, more deaths -- as things are ramped up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the American people have -- through service members, through their families -- have understood the sacrifices as we\'ve understood the sacrifices that they\'ve made, many the ultimate sacrifice over the past seven-plus years, whether it was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 I think the President in discussing an increased number of troops that is currently being phased into Afghanistan, that there\'s likely to be more violence.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously part of the increase in troops was as a result of a deteriorating security situation leading up to very important elections later this year.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people understand the sacrifice and commitment that the men and women of our military have made, and the men and women that work to stabilize the economic and governance issues that also face Afghanistan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow on what Dan was saying earlier.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday the President, at the health care forum, said the stimulus has done its job.\xc2\xa0 Are we to take that as an indication that the President thinks the stimulus is working?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The stimulus is working.\xc2\xa0 The stimulus plan is injecting money into the economy.\xc2\xa0 The stimulus plan has obligated $160 billion to deal with the dip in the amount of growth.\xc2\xa0 The stimulus plan is creating 1,900 road and construction projects.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think you\'ll hear the President say today, as he\'s said each and every day of his administration, that we\'ve got a long way to go, that he\'s not going to be satisfied until we see positive job growth, positive economic growth, and that\'s going to take some time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, is it working fast enough?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this was a program over the course of -- spend out I think 75 to 80 percent of the money over the course of two fiscal years, to do so in a way that\'s transparent, to do so in a way that\'s accountable -- which is what has happened in this piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 We understand that.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President sees this through the eyes of the American people.\xc2\xa0 The American people are hurting.\xc2\xa0 More and more people are losing their jobs, they\'re losing their health care, they\'re losing their hope and their opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is focused on each and every day.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the message seems to be, well, just wait, it\'s coming, it\'s coming.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Yunji, again, let\'s look at in the second quarter of 2008 -- we just finished the second quarter of 2009 -- in the three-month average, we were losing 153,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 This past quarter it\'s 436,000 -- because that trend line shows that in the third quarter we went from averaging 153,000 a month in that quarter to 208,000; in the fourth quarter of 2008, we had gone to 553,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 In the first quarter of 2009, we were almost at 700,000 jobs lost a month, including a January number, 741,000 jobs lost, which is the greatest one-month total in the history of our country.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">That is not something that\'s going to turn around overnight.\xc2\xa0 The American people understand that.\xc2\xa0 The President understands that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we\'ve taken important steps to get the economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to take some time?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Is the President impatient for results?\xc2\xa0 You heard him say that last week when you all had a chance to ask him questions about our economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have any states come to the White House -- any governors come to the White House in the last week asking for assistance?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know California did some, but that was several weeks ago.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you rule out any emergency assistance to any of these states?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it would have to depend on -- in some way on how that request came.\xc2\xa0 Obviously California\'s request came through --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Treasury.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, and it doesn\'t qualify.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you thought California\'s budget crisis would deepen the recession and add to -- the fact is we\'re talking about these jobs, they start canceling state services, lay off, slow down.\xc2\xa0 Does that factor in -- if you\'re worried about it dragging down the national economy?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to watch the situation in California and in other states throughout the country that are dealing with dramatic downturns in their own fiscal situations.\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, about $144 billion in health care and education money are going directly to the states that will help deal with some of that downturn.\xc2\xa0 But obviously each of these states, like is happening at kitchen tables across the country and in Washington, we\'re all going to have to make some very, very tough choices.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you thought -- if you guys came to the assumption, if they could --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not just slow down the recovery, but worsen it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the administration will look at any proposal and decide what\'s in the best interest of our overall economic health, and do what is necessary to ensure that we continue on our path toward recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Peter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you said that hopefully the worst job losses are behind us.\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe that unemployment is going to hit 10 percent sometime this year?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 We went from 9.4 to 9.5.\xc2\xa0 It may not be next month, but I would assume in the next two to three months I think it\'s quite clear that we\'ll hit that number.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again -- and as we talked about earlier, you\'ve got to create about 150,000 jobs a month simply to have the rate stay at the level that it was the previous month.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, I think we\'re headed -- we\'re definitely headed toward 10 percent.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'ll be a while before the country crosses the threshold of having these job losses end at these levels.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'ll be a while, then, yet -- past that before the country passes its threshold where you have these job losses at these levels that we\'re seeing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, look, I think we\'re going to continue to -- as we talked about yesterday, employment and unemployment are -- tend to be one of the last things that improve in an economic downturn -- again, understanding the recession we\'re in is statistically the worst since World War II.\xc2\xa0 Adding in the financial situation, obviously this is the worst economic crisis that our country has dealt with since the Depression.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Ensuring that financial stabilization happens, ensuring that small businesses are free to borrow, consumer confidence goes up, people begin to spend money -- a lot of those things are going to have to happen until businesses feel confident enough that we are out of the woods to begin to hire more people.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what you\'re going to see happen -- businesses having to make those decisions over the course of many months or year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick follow-up on the health care reform event from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 What has the staff been able to find out for this woman who got so much presidential and public attention?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My understanding that a third party has been in touch with our staff and with her about helping her out, but I don\'t want to get into who that is for her privacy reasons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Someone who would remedy her financial situation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Somebody that has specialization in her concern.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you just said that the sanctions on North Korea are having some impact.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if you could enumerate some of that impact.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have seen -- well, first of all, I think the impact alone of a united international community is tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there have been positive developments over the past few days as it relates to the actions of the North Koreans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just -- could you be a little more clear on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get any more specific than that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just positive developments in the last couple days -- that obviously doesn\'t include the four launches from this morning, right?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, the North Koreans said they were going to launch these missiles.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s surprising that they\'ve launched these missiles, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re not willing to provide any specifics on what the impact has been?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if you turn on cable, you can see some of it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow-up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you consider it a positive indication that there\'s no signs yet of sort of the warm-up that one might be aware of when someone is getting ready to lob a long-term missile?\xc2\xa0 They think it\'s not coming --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t want to get into intelligence matters.\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\'d take the North Koreans at their word that they\'re going to continue their provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 What\'s important is that the international community is united in isolating those actions, that we\'re taking all the steps that we need to to address any of those possible actions, and the united front that the international community has put up relating to implementing those sanctions and ensuring that proliferation of weapons and material from North Korea to other countries doesn\'t take place.\xc2\xa0 I think those are all very positive signs as it relates to North Korea.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple on the economy, one on Judge Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 Just to go back to what the President said yesterday about the stimulus, he said it was designed to make sure that state and local governments would not lay off policemen, firefighters, and teachers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not how I remember it being described when it was before Congress, that it was designed to prevent layoffs of these three kinds of employees.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are -- obviously there are aspects of the recovery plan relating to the COPS program that helped state and local governments hire and retain police officers.\xc2\xa0 There\'s education money that helped states and localities hire and retain teachers.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I wouldn\'t say that the only action of the bill was to keep police and firefighters on the job, but obviously there were aspects of that particular recovery plan that have helped ensure that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it in that context and that context only that the President was declaring that the stimulus has worked?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the President was declaring the fact that we are seeing an increase in construction projects -- 1,900; we\'re seeing an increase in the amount of money that\'s going out; we\'re seeing an increase in spending that goes directly to state governments that cushions the very blows that we were talking about in terms of the fiscal shortfalls that they face.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen an increase the last month in personal incomes because of some of the tax cut policies of the recovery plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Is the President satisfied?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 He\'s not going to be satisfied, again, until we see positive job growth, positive economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And I think obviously we\'re seeing some hopeful signs in the notion that -- as I said earlier, if you look at some of the quarters of job loss, there is a lessening in that number, from 691,000 in the first quarter to 436,000 on average in the second quarter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s a deepening in discouraged workers and those who were once full-time who are now part-time.\xc2\xa0 And many economists look at a much larger structural unemployment number than the 9.5 the Labor Department reported this morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 16.5 if you take into account --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President evaluate that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He evaluates it by saying --</div> <div class="legacy-para">(Cell phone rings.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Probably not with that sound.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope that\'s either a cell phone or the ice cream truck has finally arrived.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Somebody go get my wallet.\xc2\xa0 Ice cream sandwiches are on me.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President would evaluate that understanding that what some of these statistics demonstrate is we are in the midst of the worst economic recession that many of us have seen in our entire lifetimes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'re going to continue to take the steps on recovery in implementing that bill, as well as the other factors to both stabilize the economy and turn it around.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In answer to Chuck\'s question, you said the administration will look at any proposal from states that are cash-strapped.\xc2\xa0 Are you inviting states to come to the federal government to seek remedies for their fiscal problems?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m actually --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you actually say that more desperately?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was giving you them -- giving them your e-mail, not mine.\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Look, again --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, it\'s an important --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 All I wanted to say was -- here\'s the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you\'re open to it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- there\'s a chance they\'ll come with a proposal, and they may not go to TARP --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s entirely possible that they\'re going to come regardless of what I say.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But let me just say this --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\'t think they\'re not going to listen to you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no -- well, I appreciate your endorsement.\xc2\xa0 All I was trying to say was that the administration will evaluate and take action on whatever we believe will help the economy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'ve done up to this point and that\'s what we\'ll continue to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'re open to it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'re open to anything that will help turn the economy around, anything that will help create jobs, anything that will stabilize and lead to job growth.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the administration continues to look at everything.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, on Judge Sotomayor, Republicans are aggrieved that the pace of the delivery of documents, specifically relating to her membership on the board of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, came to the White House, were held here for a while, they say, and then sent up to the Judiciary Committee in such a time that they don\'t believe is sufficient for them to fully review them and be adequately prepared for the confirmation hearings.\xc2\xa0 I\'d like the White House response to that sentiment.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the best review of how Judge Sotomayor -- the best review of her -- of how she\'d be as a judge are the 17 years of legal opinions that she has written and that she herself has worked on -- not a box or boxes of documents that she didn\'t write, review, or approve.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Understand, Major, what we\'ve seen is -- well, first of all, one point is, this was the same organization whose board she was a participant in, in both 1993 and in 1998 when the Senate approved her to be a judge on each of those occasions.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">It is curious to me why a group of people would have expressed great concern over the course of the past five weeks that they have had insufficient time to read 17 years of opinions that she wrote; that now they find that there is insufficient time to review material that she didn\'t write.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think there has been plenty of time to review the record of Judge Sotomayor.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to the hearings starting as scheduled.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to the Senate processing her nomination.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Judge Sotomayor being Justice Sotomayor when the court takes part in the very important case that it will hear in early September.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I got to take Mike\'s, just because I\'m itching to do this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of health crack -- health care questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been waiting for this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- convincing, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- single-payer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because the Counsel\'s Office has advised me to ask Mike exactly how much each of these questions will cost me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ooohh!</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wow.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Knocked it down to a buck-fifty, Robert.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I seem to have forgotten my AmEx.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President in a statement today praised the progress of the Kennedy health care bill and the CBO -- the new CBO analysis of it.\xc2\xa0 And in that announcement, it says it covered 97 percent of the uninsured people.\xc2\xa0 However, my understanding is that it uses essentially a gimmick that says it counts on an expansion of Medicaid to cover a huge portion -- millions, tens of millions -- of those people that isn\'t paid for by the bill.\xc2\xa0 So how --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 Is the question you\'re asking me whether or not you think the CBO estimate that came out today is one that is accurately reflective of a complete evaluation of a health care bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in the statement, I believe, you all said --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 I know what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering if -- I think I made a similar argument about a piece of legislation evaluated by the CBO just a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 But that seems to have fallen on deaf ears.\xc2\xa0 So let me give you what I think is the answer that you were looking for both then and now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">This is obviously something that was done not by us, but by the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the HELP Committee doesn\'t have jurisdiction over a portion of that legislation.\xc2\xa0 That will be dealt with in the finance bill.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I would -- as to their so-called incomplete analysis, I would point you toward the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 I think many of the principles that the President outlined are demonstrated in the HELP bill.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the President believes on Capitol Hill, among businesses, and among the American people, we\'re making progress toward moving toward comprehensive health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead -- did you have another one?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other thing.\xc2\xa0 Nancy-Ann DeParle, there was a report today that -- about some boards that she has -- that she was on.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to that report and whether there are any concerns in terms of conflict of interest?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, we have very strict ethics rules at the White House, as you know.\xc2\xa0 I think Nancy-Ann has done a fabulous job and is implementing and working with stakeholders on each and every aspect of bringing about comprehensive health care reform, and the President appreciates her service and doesn\'t see that there\'s any conflict in that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\'ll take Jeffrey and then I\'ll go here.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was anyone from the White House invited to attend these Washington Post salons that were reported this morning?\xc2\xa0 And what is the White House\'s official policy on members of the administration doing things like this, regardless of who sponsors them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if anybody here was -- I think some people in the administration writ large may have been invited.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe, based on what I\'ve been able to check, that anybody has accepted the invitations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the Counsel would have to review an invitation like this and I think it would likely exceed what the Counsel would be -- the salon that the Washington Post is offering would likely exceed what the Counsel would feel in this case would be appropriate.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say writ large, are you talking about White House?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I meant "administration," I\'m sorry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So nobody here at the White House that you\'re aware of?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Counsel\'s Office involved in reviewing these invitations for anyone at HHS?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I can check on that specifically.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the President leaving tomorrow instead of today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Just wanted to stay here and catch up on some work.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:17 P.M.
