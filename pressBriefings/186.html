Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0What happened to Cueto? \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, it was a tough night last night. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a day game again today -- so we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and get this moving along so that we can -- (laughter) -- I know how interested all of you are in game four. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I think first pitch is at 4:00 p.m. -- not that anybody is keeping track. (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We will if you will. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I actually do not have anything at the top, Darlene, so we can go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Great, thanks. \xc2\xa0Will you give us the White House view on the Canadian election results?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, speaking of things happening in Canada, I guess. \xc2\xa0The United States and certainly President Obama congratulates Prime Minister-designate Justin Trudeau on the Liberal Party\xe2\x80\x99s victory in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s elections. \xc2\xa0I would expect the President will have the opportunity later today to call Mr. Trudeau to congratulate him on that election victory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t point out that both the President and the country is deeply appreciative of Prime Minister Harper\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to build a strong U.S.-Canada relationship. \xc2\xa0And as you know, President Obama had a number of occasions to meet firsthand -- to meet personally with Prime Minister Harper over the course of his tenure, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that President Obama will speak with Prime Minister Harper at some point in the not too distant future as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know if the President will invite Justin Trudeau to come to the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, but if an invitation is extended we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure to let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House think relations with Canada will get a little easier under Prime Minister-designate Trudeau? \xc2\xa0I know that Harper was a little annoyed over the length of time that it was taking to approve the Keystone pipeline.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it would be short-sighted to reduce the relationship between our two countries to just one issue. \xc2\xa0The fact is, there are a whole range of issues where the United States and Canada work effectively together to advance the interests of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously Canada made a substantial and important contribution to our counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0We know that Canada has been an important part of making the Trans-Pacific Partnership a reality. \xc2\xa0Canadian negotiators engaged in that process in an important way and made an important contribution in bringing those talks to a conclusion. \xc2\xa0And we believe that completing that agreement and implementing it would be in the best interests of certainly the U.S. economy and U.S. middle-class families, but we believe that it would have a positive impact on economies across the partnership, including in Canada.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCanada has also made a substantial and important commitment in advance of the Paris climate talks. \xc2\xa0We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that Canada could do in this regard, but the fact that they are stepping up and indicating -- or making a commitment is an indication of the important role that Canada plays not just in their relationship with the United States but in terms of their leadership around the world. \xc2\xa0And the United States is fortunate to have such a strong and close partnership with a country like Canada that does have this global influence.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd our bilateral relationship has enhanced the security and prosperity of the American people, and we certainly are appreciative of Prime Minister Harper\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to strengthen that relationship. \xc2\xa0And we look forward to building on that kind of progress when Mr. Trudeau takes over the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a daily Biden question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Only one?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Only one. \xc2\xa0He said earlier today that he spends between four and seven hours with the President. \xc2\xa0Seven hours seems like a long time to spend with one person. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Is that a comment on your colleagues in the AP booth by any chance? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to go there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just teasing, Darlene.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Outside of the presidential daily brief, the lunch they\xe2\x80\x99re having this afternoon, meetings with Cabinet Secretaries and some of their public appearances, their joint public appearances, how would you account for the rest of the time that he says that they spend together?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly is not unusual for the President to convene broader national security meetings or other domestic policy meetings. \xc2\xa0I mean, I think the meetings that you just ran through would account for just about three hours every day. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for the President to have another hour or two of meetings on his schedule that would also include the Vice President.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, this is also subject to the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule and the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s travel schedule, so this is not a daily occurrence. \xc2\xa0But the timing window that he laid out seems generally accurate to me, based on my reading of the public schedule.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, a follow-up on the Canadian election. \xc2\xa0Now that it\xe2\x80\x99s over, does this clear the last remaining hurdle for a decision on the Keystone pipeline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff, my understanding is that Secretary Kerry addressed this earlier today. \xc2\xa0That\'s appropriate because the Secretary of State leads the agency that is conducting the review of this project. \xc2\xa0And my understanding is that Secretary Kerry indicated that the completion of this election would have no impact on either the timing or the final determination of the project. \xc2\xa0This is a review that is still underway at the State Department, and again, based on what Secretary Kerry says, it doesn\'t sound as if the Canadian election will have an impact on the timing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have an expectation as to when you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see that recommendation delivered over here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, no. \xc2\xa0I think the President has already said that he is expecting that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to complete this policy process prior to his departure from office. \xc2\xa0But that\'s still 15 months away or so. \xc2\xa0So hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it done well before that. \xc2\xa0If for no other reason than we can stop talking about it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And us, too. \xc2\xa0You mentioned that the United States would like to see Canada do more on climate change. \xc2\xa0The Prime Minister-designate said during his campaign that he wanted to set up a national standard for carbon pricing and would like to have a North American agreement on clean energy and the environment. \xc2\xa0Do you see this new leader as -- and this election and the results of this election as an opportunity to engage on some of those ideas and perhaps get further commitments from Canada on climate change?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to judge exactly how Mr. Trudeau will follow through on some of the policy debates that occurred in the context of the campaign. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess that I didn\'t follow those policy debates particularly closely. \xc2\xa0But the United States and certainly the President has played a role in the conversations -- let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0In each of the conversations that the President has been having with world leaders of late he has been making clear that he considers commitments in advance of the Paris conference a high priority. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s been encouraging the leaders of those countries to make an important contribution to success in Paris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd obviously that was part of the discussions with President Park when she was here. \xc2\xa0This was part of the discussion that the President had with President Xi when he was at the White House just a couple of weeks ago. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this is something that was a part of the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the White House. \xc2\xa0And the President spent a lot of time talking about this in the context of the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0So just off the top of my head, it seems that in each of the significant engagements that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with world leaders over the last several weeks this has been high on his agenda. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be the case when he speaks with Mr. Trudeau, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly, from that campaign, Mr. Trudeau said he would withdraw Canada\xe2\x80\x99s air force from the fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \xc2\xa0How does the White House feel about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, the Obama administration and the United States will be in talks with our Canadian partners about their contribution to our counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0They have made an important contribution thus far, and we\'re obviously deeply appreciative of them lending their talent and skill and expertise to that effort. \xc2\xa0And we hope that we can continue to count on their ongoing support for this very important mission.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you like them to stay in it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We certainly value the contributions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received from the Canadians thus far in terms of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and we certainly are hoping that they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to play that important role that they\xe2\x80\x99ve played thus far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJ.C.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, as winter now begins to bear down on Eastern Europe and the immigrant -- the migration refugee crisis there, has the President had any updates, any new conversations with the leaders, including Angela Merkel, et cetera, in terms of additional support? \xc2\xa0We know that the U.S. is number one in providing that kind of monetary support; we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that. \xc2\xa0But is there any new initiatives that this White House is beginning to prepare for?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new to announce at this point, J.C. \xc2\xa0The United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to this effort. \xc2\xa0And the President continues to be concerned about the significance of this humanitarian crisis. \xc2\xa0The scale of this crisis is historic, even, and it certainly should stir the conscience of people around the world in responding to it. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States has stepped up. \xc2\xa0The U.S. government has stepped up to make a substantial contribution. \xc2\xa0The White House recently did organize this online portal so that if there are private U.S. citizens who are interested in making a financial contribution to ongoing humanitarian relief efforts, that there\xe2\x80\x99s information about that on the White House website, essentially it will steer you toward charitable organizations that are involved in responding to this crisis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some of the past hatreds in that part of the country since the \xe2\x80\x9830s are coming out again, resurfacing. \xc2\xa0I know the President is aware of it. \xc2\xa0Has this caused him any moral pain when he thinks of this kind of thing coming back again to face Europe, and, in fact, could face this country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, J.C., I think part of this -- there is a natural human reaction that I think does not reflect in any way the majority, the prevailing opinion either across the United States or across Europe about the fact that these individuals who are fleeing violence in Syria are human beings. \xc2\xa0They have the same worries and concerns and dreams and ambitions that other human beings do. \xc2\xa0And our humanity calls on us to recognize that humanity inside of them. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is reflected in the policy approach that the United States has pursued. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reflected in the kind of reception that most Europeans have offered when these individuals have arrived in Europe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s not to diminish the significance of the challenge in providing for the needs of these individuals and making sure that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- or at least minimally disrupts the good order in those countries and the day-to-day life of the citizens. \xc2\xa0But to diminish or ignore the humanity of these individuals fleeing a desperate situation and fleeing terrible violence in their home country is something that I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that only a small minority of people have done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGeorge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In his debate with Mitt Romney in 2012, the President said that Vice President Biden had advised him against going after bin Laden. \xc2\xa0The Vice President has now changed his story on that. \xc2\xa0Is the President similarly changing his recollection?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0George, I was not in the room when these decisions were being made or when the President was consulting his advisors about this very difficult foreign policy call that he made. \xc2\xa0And there have already been books that have been written about this; I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be more, or at least there will be more books in which we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to read out this momentous time in American history. \xc2\xa0So I\'m going to leave the dissection and the oral history, if you will, of those days to those who were actually there. \xc2\xa0And to the extent that there\xe2\x80\x99s some greater clarity you\xe2\x80\x99d like to seek, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity at some point to ask those who were in the room.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But as far as you know, the President is still sticking with what he said in the debate with Romney?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have any new insight to share with you about the President\xe2\x80\x99s recollection of those days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is a simple question on the same subject. \xc2\xa0Vice President Biden says that he advised the President to go forward with that raid. \xc2\xa0Is that true?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, on many occasions, I\'ve declined to provide insight into the private conversations between the President of the United States and the Vice President of the United States, other than to tell you that the President deeply values that advice. \xc2\xa0But I\'m not going to get into the substance of their conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you can\'t tell me whether or not the Vice President today was telling the truth when he said he advised to go forward with the bin Laden raid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m telling you that I don\'t have any insight to share with you about the private conversations between the President and the Vice President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because what are we to make of the fact that his -- Leon Panetta said, point-blank, in his book that Biden came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information; Robert Gates said Biden was against the operation; Hillary Clinton said Biden remained skeptical? \xc2\xa0Biden himself has said that he was against the decision. \xc2\xa0He said, point-blank, that, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. President, my suggestion is don\'t go.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I mean, what are we to make of the fact that all of these people said exactly the opposite, including Biden himself?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I\'m not going to be able to provide a lot of insight into private communications between the President and the Vice President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you about something else that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t private communications that the Vice President said today. \xc2\xa0He said that the President said, you have veto power over anybody in my Cabinet. \xc2\xa0Is that true? \xc2\xa0Did the President give Vice President Biden veto power over all Cabinet nominations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I am not aware of the kinds of conversations that then Senator Obama had with then Senator Biden about him coming onboard as the running mate. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t have any information about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, let me ask -- I mean, you worked on the campaign, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working in this building for six years. \xc2\xa0Have you ever heard any suggestion that the Vice President has veto power over Cabinet nominations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\'m not privy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have you ever heard it suggested by anyone?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not privy to all of the conversations between the President and the Vice President, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take it up with one of the two of them if they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to talk about it publicly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What do you think we should make of the fact that today, as we\'re all waiting for Biden\xe2\x80\x99s decision, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about spending up to seven hours a day with the President, he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about having veto power, that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about being in favor of a raid that he previously said he was against? \xc2\xa0I mean, what is going on?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, you guys are the ones who can read the political tea leaves, and to a certain extent, that\'s part of your job. \xc2\xa0What I\'ll say from my perspective is that the fact that we\'re spending a lot of time discussing the presidential prospects of a candidate who is essentially saying that he would get in the race to try to advance the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda that the President himself has been fighting for for the last seven years, frankly, that\'s a luxury for me, not a burden. And if we spent this much time talking about people who were vowing to block the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, that would be a lot more difficult for me than having an opportunity to discuss how viable and possibly influential a candidate could be by running, saying that he wants to advance the kind of agenda that we\'ve been fighting for here for seven years. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0By the way, you just called him a candidate. \xc2\xa0Do you know something we don\'t?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I guess I meant potential candidate. \xc2\xa0I misspoke.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one last. \xc2\xa0We\'re you surprised when you heard the Vice President today say that he advised the President to go forward with the bin Laden raid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t following it closely. \xc2\xa0I was following it on Twitter, actually, so --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Were you surprised when you saw it on Twitter?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not particularly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Really?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I want to follow up on Jon, and then I have one along the same lines. \xc2\xa0How much influence does the Vice President have on this President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President himself, when talking about the relationship, has talked about Vice President Biden being one of the most consequential Vice Presidents in the history of the country. \xc2\xa0And I think if you take a look at the contribution that he\xe2\x80\x99s made on a range of domestic policy issues, including the implementation of the Recovery Act, and his influence on a range of foreign policy issues, particularly in managing hot spots like Ukraine, that clearly Vice President Biden plays a really important role in conceiving of and advancing the agenda of the Obama administration and of the Obama White House. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying his significant influence in this building.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it true now here at the White House that many are waiting for his decision as well as the American public?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s been true for months. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So has anyone urged him? \xc2\xa0Because I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding that you\'re waiting to hear what he says, whether you can move one way or the other, whether you support him that way in his run or his bid, or just move on just normal here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I feel confident that we are -- well, I think the President himself has acknowledged that he has no immediate plans to offer an endorsement of any candidate for President. \xc2\xa0That could change down the line, but that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s said. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear that that\'s going to be his position regardless of the decision that Vice President Biden makes. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that -- yes, there is an element of -- like all of you -- waiting for the Vice President to make what is an intensely personal decision about whether or not to run for President, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if that has a day-to-day impact on the important work that goes on around here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now, on another subject, on the Benghazi hearing. \xc2\xa0Today, I understand that David Kendall, the attorney for Hillary Clinton, as well as Trey Gowdy and Elijah Cummings will be meeting to set the ground rules for Thursday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I had not heard that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, it was an exclusive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there you go. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Breaking news, everybody.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0So, anyway, Trey Gowdy is proposing to all of the persons in this meeting that he wants each member of the committee to have four questions, which would leave up to eight hours. \xc2\xa0What do you -- what does this White House want to see when it comes to this very sensitive hearing, particularly as it relates to Benghazi -- not the emails necessarily, but Benghazi, as the family of those who died want answers still in the midst of all of this controversy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what we have seen from a lot of the families is not just a desire for answers, but a desire to not see this terrible tragedy used for partisan political gain. \xc2\xa0And, unfortunately, that\'s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the committee. \xc2\xa0And you don\'t have to take my word for it. \xc2\xa0There are two different Republican members of Congress who have arrived at the same conclusion, including the Majority Leader.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I do think -- as I mentioned yesterday -- that Republicans on the committee are going to be under intense pressure to justify their very existence, to justify the existence of this committee, and to prove to the American people that this committee is not just another arm of the Republican National Committee. \xc2\xa0You would hope that something this serious and this important would not be so freely subjected to partisan politics. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what\xe2\x80\x99s occurred. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd given that pressure that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Republicans on the committee are feeling, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to come loaded for bear. And they are going to come out with aggressive, hostile questioning of the Secretary of State, trying to further the goal that Leader McCarthy laid out, which is driving down her poll numbers. \xc2\xa0So that will be -- well, I expect it will be something that will be closely watched by at least people in this room. \xc2\xa0And, again, I think Republicans on the committee will be engaged in a very vigorous, aggressive effort to try to justify the continuing existence of the committee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that his administration -- at least the State Department -- is under a microscope and I guess part of his job as well when this hearing takes place Thursday? \xc2\xa0That she was his Secretary of State.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, not any more than he is every other day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConnie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you so much, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you hear me?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I can hear you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Israel and the Palestinians, has the administration ever considered reducing aid or military aid to pressure the parties into some sort of agreement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Connie, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything like that being contemplated at this point. \xc2\xa0What the U.S. position has been is that a two-state solution is the best way to resolve the conflict between the two parties, and the only way to arrive at the kind of negotiated settlement that results in a two-state solution is for the two parties to sit down face-to-face and negotiate directly. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as you know, Secretary Kerry and many Secretaries of State before him have expended significant effort and energy to try to bring both sides of the table and to try to bring them conclusion around those conversations. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not occurred -- and I say \xe2\x80\x9cunfortunately\xe2\x80\x9d because we believe it is both clearly in the interests of our closest ally in the Middle East for the situation to be resolved in this way; we also believe that it would be in the interest of the Palestinian people to resolve this conflict in that way, and resolving the conflict would advance the national security interests of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can the United States --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that both sides, the leaders of the Palestinian people and the leaders of the nation of Israel, are under pressure from the citizens, from their people, from their constituents, to end this conflict. \xc2\xa0Neither side is well-served by it. \xc2\xa0It has taken a toll on the economy. \xc2\xa0It certainly has taken a toll on the security in both Palestinian and Israeli neighborhoods. \xc2\xa0And the significant loss of innocent life is just tragic. \xc2\xa0And hopefully, both sides will be able to summon the political courage at some point relatively soon to come to the table and finally make the kinds of tough political decisions that will be required to resolve their differences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a UNESCO amendment floating around which essentially strips Israel of any rights (inaudible) including the Western Wall. \xc2\xa0Does the administration have any (inaudible) UNESCO?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the U.N. Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s office for a comment on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0You said that you would consider it a luxury and not a burden to have someone running for President who would uphold the policies of this administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I mean, I guess I should say another one. \xc2\xa0But, yes, another one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see any circumstances under which if Joe Biden gets into the race it could make it more difficult for Democrats to win the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s lots of political analysis that has been done and probably will be done around that specific question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No concern around the White House that that could happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think the view around the White House is that the Democratic voters across the country will choose the person that is best positioned to represent the Democratic Party in the next presidential election. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of confidence here in the White House in the ability of Democratic voters to do exactly that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd you can be sure that whoever the Democratic nominee is, is both someone who will understand the importance of building on the important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also a candidate that can count on the strong support of the incumbent President of the United States. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend a lot of time this time of year, next year, advocating for that Democratic presidential candidate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have not wanted to consistently -- and have said you aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily privy to any conversations that the Vice President and the President are having about this topic. \xc2\xa0But is the President staying out of this, essentially?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President is staying out of it in that he understands that the Vice President has to make his own personal decision about this, and the President is staying out of it with regard to his understanding that this is only a decision that Vice President Biden can make for himself and for his family. \xc2\xa0I think the President is sympathetic to how difficult a decision like this is to make. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, the President understands that this is a decision that can be made by Vice President Biden and by Vice President Biden alone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Which is not to say he\xe2\x80\x99s not offering advice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into their conversations. \xc2\xa0Obviously, they\xe2\x80\x99re having lunch today, maybe even right now, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if questions of politics came up. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not privy to the details of those conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me ask you quickly about another topic, which is guns. \xc2\xa0The Gallup Poll out yesterday says 55 percent of adults want stricter regulations. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s 8 percentage points up from where it was last year. \xc2\xa0And only 33 percent of those polled said they felt the current gun sale regulations should remain the same. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, the President stood right where you\xe2\x80\x99re standing after the horrific Oregon shooting and basically said they should -- this will not stand, this cannot stand. \xc2\xa0What is the White House doing actively to see that something changes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chris, you heard the President, in a news conference that he did about a week later, acknowledge that his team was going back and scrubbing through the law to determine if there were additional authorities that could be used by the President of the United States to try to have an impact on some of these rules. \xc2\xa0And the President has made clear that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do as much as he possibly can within his power to try to prevent those who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have guns from getting them in the first place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President believe strongly that we can do that without undermining the fundamental constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0And the most important impact that we can have in this area would be for Congress to pass a common-sense law that would close the gun show loophole and ensure that everybody who tries to purchase a firearm even at a gun show would be subjected to a background check.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is there actively work going on with influential members of Congress in this regard?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as it relates to Congress, I think the President has been quite clear about what will be required before we see significant change in Congress. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to need to see the American people step up and to make their voices heard. \xc2\xa0And you mentioned this latest polling data, but there\xe2\x80\x99s ample data out there, and has been for quite some time, to indicate that a vast majority of the American public holds this common-sense view. \xc2\xa0And it won\xe2\x80\x99t be until that that common-sense view is strongly conveyed to members of Congress, and until members of Congress understand that the votes that they expect from their constituents will be contingent on them holding that same common-sense view, and until that political effort has been mobilized, we\'re unlikely to see Congress take the kind of action that the President certainly believes is long overdue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And knowing that you love to comment on what some Republicans are saying, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just make this final question. \xc2\xa0Donald Trump said last night that President Obama is working on an executive order to take Americans\xe2\x80\x99 guns away, something that\'s getting a lot of pickup, particularly in conservative media. \xc2\xa0Do you want to respond to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President has made no bones about the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to use every element of his administrative authority to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. \xc2\xa0But I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s track record makes clear that he doesn\'t just respect, but actually is willing to protect the basic Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. \xc2\xa0Those are just the facts about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record. \xc2\xa0Those are the facts about the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority. \xc2\xa0And we certainly would welcome others who share that common-sense view for making their voices heard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Trump is lying or misinformed? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have no idea what Donald Trump is doing. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJustin Sink.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a couple things, but first wanted to quickly look back on the Biden thing and ask if possibly you could talk to the President or Vice President about this, because there is a precedent actually of White House spokesmen commenting on this very issue. \xc2\xa0Jay Carney, your predecessor, is among the chorus of people who say that the Vice President did advise the President not to go after bin Laden in the raid. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- since it was said from your podium if you could clarify that for me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably do is, at the next opportunity that you guys have to ask a question either of the President or the Vice President, you can decide whether or you you\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask them directly, and if so, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on me.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about CIA Director John Brennan. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are reports that his email was hacked but also that the hackers were able to obtain sensitive data that was forwarded from his White House email address, including the names of people who were visiting the White House and possibly substantive information about intelligence assets. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that has led to any investigation here at the White House about his use of his White House email and transferring sensitive data from his White House email to an obviously less secure personal email.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Justin, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those specific reports and I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not aware of any ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0I feel confident in saying that Director Brennan understands as well as anybody in the federal government the need to handle sensitive data with the appropriate level of caution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think what is clear is that this underscores the importance of government officials -- as it sounds like Director Brennan did -- using their official government email address for official government work. \xc2\xa0But it does highlight the risk that all of us face when it comes to the security of even our private email. \xc2\xa0And certainly this is the kind of environment -- this cybersecurity environment that we\xe2\x80\x99re currently operating in is one that requires vigilance not just on the part of those of us, all of us that have private email addresses, but also on the part of the companies that are responsible for administering the security around those private email systems. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd many of the best practices that this administration has advocated are the kinds of things that would bolster cybersecurity, and not just in the government space but also in the private sector as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then I just wanted to ask if you could maybe preview the meeting with the leader of Pakistan later this week. I know that the President kind of vaguely referenced the need to end sanctuaries for terrorists -- or for the Taliban and other terrorists, presumably within Pakistan. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a specific ask that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have on that, and if there are other kind of agenda items that the President hopes to raise during this meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comprehensive preview of their discussions at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously, as I mentioned yesterday, the United States has an important security relationship with Pakistan, that our security forces have in a variety of ways been able to effectively coordinate our efforts in a way that enhances the national security of both the United States and Pakistan. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously there are extremist elements inside of Pakistan that have committed terrible acts of violence and terrible acts of terrorism inside of Pakistan. \xc2\xa0And I have on previous occasions read condolence statements on behalf of the American people to the Pakistani people because of those extremist elements. \xc2\xa0I cite that only to note that this is a shared priority of our two countries; that this risk that we sense emanates from this broader region is a risk that -- or is a threat that Pakistan has had to deal with firsthand, and it underscores the importance of our security relationship with the Pakistanis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The only other thing that the President mentioned was the need to push the Taliban back into peace negotiations in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering both if that\xe2\x80\x99s a topic that you expect to come up, but also if you put into that context Treasury -- they have sanctioned a top Taliban official, and whether that\xe2\x80\x99s a carrot or a stick, how does that fit into that strategy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve observed before, one of the early rounds of reconciliation talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban was actually hosted by the Pakistani government inside of Pakistan. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the Pakistan government recognizes how important those reconciliation efforts are and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that they\xe2\x80\x99ve stepped up in trying to facilitate constructive conversations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs it relates to the Treasury announcement, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department about the individual that was sanctioned and what activities earned that individual this special designation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMajor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Take us to a couple of other things that the Vice President said today. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cevery Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s job in relationship to their President is defined by the President himself.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Would you agree with that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, based on what I saw on Twitter -- which can be a little dangerous --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He just said that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it works. \xc2\xa0The President defines your job when you\xe2\x80\x99re the Vice President. \xc2\xa0Would you agree with that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would agree with what the Vice President said, which is that a lot of the authority and influence that\xe2\x80\x99s derived from the office of Vice President is based on the relationship between the President and the Vice President. \xc2\xa0And I think all of you have observed the closeness and respect that\xe2\x80\x99s included in that relationship between this President and this Vice President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So this Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s role was defined by the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, it sounds like that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what he said, so he would know better than I.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You would agree with that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to disagree with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The reason I bring that up is because, if, in fact, the Vice President runs, and he\xe2\x80\x99s already beginning to differentiate or, in a very robust way, describe his role, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no other person that we can ask directly other than the President than you about what he did and what he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do. \xc2\xa0And this is going to put you potentially in the position of litigating what his role was here vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the Secretary of State, former Secretary of State Clinton, or anybody else. \xc2\xa0So what I want to sort of lay before you is, are you going to take up that role? \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to dance around it today because he\xe2\x80\x99s not a candidate. \xc2\xa0But if he becomes a candidate, are you going to take these questions and answer them as directly and fully as you possibly can?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I will do is this -- and this may be getting ahead of ourselves, but this is what I would do, maybe is what I should say. \xc2\xa0Each of these candidates, particularly Secretary Clinton, and if he chooses to become a candidate, Vice President Biden, will be responsible for going out there in public and making their own affirmative case. \xc2\xa0And if there is an instance in which the President\xe2\x80\x99s interests are at stake, then it\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility to go out there and make sure that his interests are properly and well-represented. \xc2\xa0But in a debate like this one that has emerged based on the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s public comments today, it\xe2\x80\x99s raised questions among all of you about the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s role, what his views were at the time -- those are all questions you can ask the Vice President or his spokesperson.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI certainly have had lots of positive things to say about the Vice President because of his important contributions to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s and our administration\xe2\x80\x99s success. \xc2\xa0But if he chooses to become a candidate for Vice President, he will have ample opportunity to make his own public case about why the American people should promote him to the top job. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when he said, as he did today, that when he traveled around the world, \xe2\x80\x9cworld leaders know that I am speaking for the President,\xe2\x80\x9d is that true?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that is true. \xc2\xa0And I think that those world leaders know when they\'re receiving the Vice President of the United States, they\'re receiving him because they know that the President has asked him to go.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that should be interpreted, yes or no, as him being a more significant voice than the present Secretary of State or Defense Secretary, somebody like that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the same thing could be said about the Secretary of State or any other senior U.S. official that\'s representing the interest of the U.S. government before another government. \xc2\xa0They\'re there to represent the interests of the American people, and they\'re there to represent -- to try to advance our priorities. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s true --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- interpret that as the Vice President suggesting he was speaking more powerfully on behalf of the President than anybody else in the Cabinet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think when people are receiving the Vice President, they understand that they\'re receiving somebody who has a very close personal relationship with the President and somebody that has a very detailed understanding of the President\xe2\x80\x99s views and priorities. \xc2\xa0So I understand why other countries are eager to have the opportunity to receive the Vice President. \xc2\xa0So I guess to that extent, that\'s the significance of a vice presidential visit to another country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When Jon was asking you about what to make of all this, you said you\xe2\x80\x99ll let us read the political tea leaves. \xc2\xa0And what he was asking about was operational debates or advice or things that were said within the confines of this White House. \xc2\xa0It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a political question. \xc2\xa0And I wonder why your answer went to politics. \xc2\xa0Do you think that this has become a political debate even when it goes to what the Vice President either said to the President, or what his role was in regards to Cabinet or veto power? \xc2\xa0Those are operational questions. \xc2\xa0They\'re not innately political questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly Jon\xe2\x80\x99s question in which I gave that answer. \xc2\xa0I do believe that it was a question about sort of the political consequences of it all. \xc2\xa0But look, when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking -- I think there are a couple of important things to separate out. \xc2\xa0Yes, these conversations are operational, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about them even in the immediate aftermath of the successful completion of the mission. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it now is because of politics. \xc2\xa0And so separating that out in some cases may be a little bit in the eye of the beholder. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I will do moving forward is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past, which is to do the best that I can to try to help you understand the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on things and to represent the President\xe2\x80\x99s interests when they come into question. \xc2\xa0But if it\xe2\x80\x99s a question purely of politics that only has tangential interest or tangential impact on the President, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll at least be less likely to weigh in. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how this works going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Someone the President knows and respects, Jim Clyburn, said today that it was his opinion and point of view that the Vice President should not announce that he was going to run for President, that he should say he is available if necessary. \xc2\xa0What do you think of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s creative. \xc2\xa0Look, everybody is entitled to their opinion and certainly somebody like Mr. Clyburn, who has been a close observer of presidential politics for decades now, based on the prominence that his home state has in the process of choosing a Democratic nominee, so Mr. Clyburn certainly knows what he is talking about. \xc2\xa0But with all due respect to somebody as significant and as sophisticated as Mr. Clyburn, there is only one person\xe2\x80\x99s view whose matters, and in this case it\xe2\x80\x99s the Vice President of the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPam.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, is there a feeling -- back on Pakistan -- from the administration that they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing enough to tamp down the extremist interest in that country? \xc2\xa0And how would you describe U.S.-Pakistani relationship now? \xc2\xa0Are we frenemies? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) Is there still any lingering friction --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Technical term? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hard to translate. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any lingering friction over the bin Laden raid or anything?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s been well documented that there have been some peaks and troughs in the relationship between the United States and Pakistan when it comes to the relationship between our two countries. \xc2\xa0I think something similar could be said about the United States and our relationship with a variety of countries around the world over the last couple of decades.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat the President hopes to do is to strengthen the relationship between our two countries based on our shared interest. \xc2\xa0And as I mentioned either to Major or to Chris, there is a shared interest that the United States and Pakistan have in countering extremist forces in that region of the world. \xc2\xa0This is something that Pakistan has to deal with on their doorstep. \xc2\xa0And to the extent that the United States can be helpful in that regard, we would like to be, principally because we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest for Pakistan to succeed in their fight against those extremist elements, and to make their country safer. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been supportive of their efforts to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s not a feeling that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done enough on their own?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are -- this is true with even our closest allies -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re always encouraging them to do more. \xc2\xa0Even our NATO allies. \xc2\xa0We regularly get into this debate about how much more of a financial contribution we would like to see our NATO allies make to their defense budgets because we believe there is more that they could do to advance our shared interest and to strengthen our alliance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will come to his meeting with Prime Minister Sharif with some ideas about what more the Pakistanis could do to strengthen the relationship between our two countries and to advance the security interests of our two countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Has the President met Justin Trudeau?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware -- off the top of my head, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any individual meeting that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had, but we can look into that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, appreciate that. \xc2\xa0Now that Trudeau is leading Canada, and Australia and France also have progressives leading the way, as does this country, what does that say about the job left among some of the major economies in the world, do you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to compare those broader trends. \xc2\xa0I think ultimately these are citizens that are casting votes based on the political climate in each of their individual countries. \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to -- maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that knows a little bit more about current international politics than I do that might be able to draw a line between all of those elections, but my sense of politics is that each of these electorates is responding to dynamics inside their own country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Keystone, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a great deal about it. \xc2\xa0Does this tamp down that division or that divisiveness between this administration and the Canadian administration now that Trudeau will be moving into power?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My sense is that the strength of the U.S.-Canada relationship is based on all those areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to effectively work together to advance our shared interests. \xc2\xa0And whether that\xe2\x80\x99s making commitments to the climate process in Paris, to fighting ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, or working cooperatively with 10 other nations in the Asia Pacific to advance our economic interests in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, each of those represents substantial areas where the United States and Canada have been able to pursue our joint interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Keystone is not a big deal, is that kind of what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that all three of those other things that I just named are a much bigger deal. \xc2\xa0And ultimately, a decision will be rendered on the Keystone project, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that regardless of what that final decision is, I have confidence and will continue to have confidence in the strength of the U.S.-Canada relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jim Webb steps out of the race on the Democratic side. Do you feel like his is a voice that has a place in Democratic politics? \xc2\xa0And why do you feel like he didn\xe2\x80\x99t resonate for whatever reason?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you all speculate on what Senator Webb may have been able to do differently to try to get a little bit more traction inside the Democratic presidential primary race. \xc2\xa0Obviously, Senator Webb is somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s made a substantial contribution to our nation\xe2\x80\x99s national security -- both his service in our military in Vietnam to his service in the Reagan administration, but also his service in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s had quite an interesting career, and I think like many people I\xe2\x80\x99m quite interested to see what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do next.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0NDAA making its way here perhaps as soon as this evening -- is that your understanding? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s my understanding that it could come in the next day or two. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly to what to attribute the delay in delivering the legislation to the White House, but maybe some of our Republican friends on Capitol Hill could explain that. \xc2\xa0But I think we all know the outcome here. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You talked about this Biden question and the things he said today as maybe having some tangential importance. \xc2\xa0But the reason it\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting is because it\xe2\x80\x99s different than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from other people before, and it goes directly to, A, what happened that night, exactly, who felt what about it, and what kind of pressure the President was under. \xc2\xa0And the President himself talked about it in that context when he said even the Vice President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for this. \xc2\xa0So is there any reason to doubt that what the President said when he said those words wasn\xe2\x80\x99t accurate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to indicate a change in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view. \xc2\xa0I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the people who were in the room at the time are the ones that should be consulted. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, the decision that mattered was the decision that was made by the President of the United States to carry out a mission against Osama bin Laden. \xc2\xa0And thanks to the courage and professionalism and effectiveness of our men and women in the intelligence community and our men and women in uniform, that mission -- that daring mission was successful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that is, again, why it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting, because the people who were in that room are saying all kinds of different things. \xc2\xa0And today, the Vice President said that there were only two people who were definitive in their views -- Panetta and Gates. \xc2\xa0But that\'s different than what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Hillary Clinton. \xc2\xa0So when the Vice President said that today, is there any reason -- he was in that room -- is there any reason to doubt what he said?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think historians would probably tell you that this is not the first time that a significant political event has prompted differing recollections from people who participated in it. \xc2\xa0And that is not to call into question the integrity or veracity or honesty of anybody who participated. \xc2\xa0I think it is an acknowledgement that, particularly when the stakes are really high and the pressure is on, that in hindsight the situation looks different. \xc2\xa0And so for sussing all that out, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk to people who were actually in the room.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0But this being one of the most important moments in the President\xe2\x80\x99s term and something that he\xe2\x80\x99s talked extensively about, is there a concern that there might be some mis-remembering going on here on the part of the Vice President?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, for an accurate accounting of what happened, you\'re going to have to talk with people who were in the room.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And in general, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say generally speaking here, if somebody was going to jump into a presidential race at this point -- (laughter) --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Somebody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just anybody, huh?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, we can look at anything, generally, right? \xc2\xa0And numbers were showing that about a third of all Democrats didn\'t think it was a great idea, and another third didn\'t care, would you ever think that it was a good idea for that person to get in? And would you not possibly think that it might be bad for the party for somebody to --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the party for somebody who has spent a career fighting for and even advancing the priorities of that party and of the country from making a decision to get into the race. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, the Vice President will have to decide for himself if that\'s the right call for him personally and for his family.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jordan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Follow up on the NDAA, Speaker Boehner indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to sign that bill today. \xc2\xa0So does the White House have a sense of when President Obama will actually veto the bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know when it\xe2\x80\x99s done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any sense whether it would be a pocket veto or him actually vetoing it?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would not anticipate that we\'re going to wait around 10 days even if Republicans waited at least 10 days to send it up here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJared. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, are Republicans in Congress friends the way the Vice President said yesterday, or enemies the way Hillary Clinton said last week in Las Vegas?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess they have their own individual views on this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, you\'ve heard me talk quite a bit about how disappointing it has been to see Republicans in Congress engage in a strategy to reflexively oppose -- strictly for partisan reasons -- everything the President has tried to advance. \xc2\xa0In some cases that has led Republicans down a path of actually opposing ideas that they\xe2\x80\x99ve previously supported. \xc2\xa0And I think what Republicans found is that in the short term that ended up being a particularly effective political strategy -- after all, they won some significant congressional elections as a result of it. \xc2\xa0It did not, however, succeed in accomplishing Leader McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal at the time, which was to ensure that President Obama was a one-term President. \xc2\xa0So, in that regard, that strategy failed. \xc2\xa0And I think when you look at the longer term national prospects for the Republican Party, this strategy has been quite corrosive -- to say nothing of the impact that it\xe2\x80\x99s had on the broader country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, that all said, there have been some areas where the administration has been able to work with Republicans. \xc2\xa0The most recent example of this would be I suppose the Trade Promotion Authority legislation that passed over the summer that paved the way for us reaching an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership that we hope will be approved in bipartisan fashion in the Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the fact that the President is championing an agreement that we expect will get strong support from Republicans in both the House and the Senate indicates the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to actually work across the aisle to get something done. \xc2\xa0This is a priority that is held by more Republicans in Congress than Democrats, but yet the Democratic President is aggressively pursuing it. \xc2\xa0And I think that is a quite clear illustration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to work with Republicans to advance shared objectives even if the Republicans are not willing, in general, to extend him the same courtesy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What do you think the Vice President meant yesterday when he was talking about Darrell Issa -- in the context of clean energy -- and he said -- he seemed to make a note of it that Republicans are friends, that Republicans can be useful in these kinds of situations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that what Vice President -- I didn\'t see his actual comments, so let me just -- I can speak to the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of this, and that simply is this is -- we\'re in an era of divided government, and the American people, in their wisdom, elected a Republican majority in both the House and the Senate. \xc2\xa0And that means that if we\'re going to advance the nation\xe2\x80\x99s priorities, we\'re going to have to find a way to do it in bipartisan fashion; that we\'re going to choose policies that can get the support of at least some Republicans on Capitol Hill and earn the support of the Democratic President. \xc2\xa0And that means that Democrats and Republicans have to work together to advance our shared interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President has long been committed to that principle. And, unfortunately, we have seen too many Republicans on Capitol Hill long resist that principle. \xc2\xa0That\'s been a disappointment to the President. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not been good for the country, and I think over the long term, it\xe2\x80\x99s not one that has advanced the political interests of the Republican Party. \xc2\xa0But that\'s just my opinion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So if it\xe2\x80\x99s friends, is it friends without too many benefits? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Or saying earlier \xe2\x80\x9cfrenemies\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I don\'t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJohn Gizzi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just back to Justin Trudeau, and I wonder if you can clear something up. \xc2\xa0While he is a progressive, his position in the campaign was he was for going ahead with the Keystone XL pipeline -- no different from Prime Minister Harper, save for the fact he wanted new environmental standards that he thought would bring President Obama and the administration along. But do you say that that will have no effect on the report from the State Department or the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry has indicated that the timing of the election and the outcome of the election would have no impact on the timing or the outcome of the ongoing review of the Keystone pipeline at the State Department. \xc2\xa0So I take him at his word on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The other thing is, a few weeks ago, I know you made very clear the administration\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to politically based riders that would try to defund Planned Parenthood. \xc2\xa0Congressman Mike Kelly has taken a different course, calling on the IRS to audit Planned Parenthood -- different from the defunding effort. What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the IRS is an independent enforcement agency, and this administration has worked hard to ensure that the IRS\xe2\x80\x99s activities are not influenced by the political debate. And that is a principle that we have worked aggressively to uphold and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one that I believe that every member of Congress should respect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Great. \xc2\xa0At a recent town hall in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her evolution on the issue of same-sex marriage, saying personal relationships (inaudible) for marriage equality. \xc2\xa0The Secretary didn\xe2\x80\x99t declare her support for same-sex marriage until 2013, after she left the administration. \xc2\xa0Are you aware of any reason why Secretary Clinton couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have endorsed marriage equality during her time as Secretary of State?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work at the State Department so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have sort of the most keen sensitivity to what pressures she may have been under in that role. \xc2\xa0But you can certainly check with her campaign and they can give you their sense of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to glean that because she did not say anything about the issue that she did not support same-sex marriage throughout her tenure in the administration, even after President Obama came out for it in 2012?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what her views on this topic are, so you should just check with her campaign.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I do have one follow-up question, and that is, do you think given the President\xe2\x80\x99s own evolution on this issue, do you think her changing views on marriage should be seen differently than her other positions that have changed, such as Keystone XL or the Trans-Pacific Partnership?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think there is an understandable tendency to want to try to make all those things the same or to try to divine some element of her personality by looking at her views on a range of topics. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to her views on same-sex marriage, I take her at her word that her views on this topic underwent the kind of change that a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s views have other the last several years. \xc2\xa0And I think many people have noted the significance of this changing debate in our country and this changing debate in our political system. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly believes that it reflects important progress that our country has made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:55 P.M.
