EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to start out with the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Hey, Bill.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will host the White House Science Fair, celebrating the winners of a broad range of science, technology, engineering and math -- that\xe2\x80\x99s STEM -- competitions.\xc2\xa0 In the evening the President will attend an event for the DSCC in Rockville, Maryland. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will sign the Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans Executive Order at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Wednesday, the President will meet with his national security team for his monthly meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 Later the President will travel to Portland, Oregon, to attend a fundraiser and rally for gubernatorial candidate John Kitzhaber.\xc2\xa0 The President will then travel to Seattle where he will spend the night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will hold an event in Seattle and then attend a rally for Senator Murray. Later the President will travel to San Francisco, California.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will attend a dinner for the DNC.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend the night in San Francisco.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President will travel to Los Angeles, where he will attend events for Senator Barbara Boxer and for the DNC.\xc2\xa0 Later the President will travel to Las Vegas, where he will attend an event for the DNC and later an event for Senator Reid and the DSCC.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend the night in Vegas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn Saturday, the President will travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota, home of the mighty Golden Gophers, and attend an event for Mark Dayton, and then will attend an event for the DCCC.\xc2\xa0 The President will return to Washington, D.C., in the evening.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd as a final note, on the week ahead, today is Ben LaBolt\xe2\x80\x99s last day, who in his tenure at the White House was energetic and spirited and pioneered an effort to communicate with colleagues and reporters using just pictures of mimes, which everybody was really impressed with.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo with that, I will be happy to take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can you tell us about this meeting with Condi Rice today, why the President is meeting her, what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 She was going to be in town, and the President obviously couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make her book party later today.\xc2\xa0 But he wanted to bring her in and have a chat with her.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about a wide range of foreign policy issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan, Iraq?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 A wide range of issues, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we get a readout after the meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think there will be some information made available.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly how that will be provided just yet.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long are they scheduled to meet for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s on his schedule for about 30 minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, do you have any comment to make on -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what the final figure is on the deficit for fiscal 2010, but do you have any statement to make on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, those numbers will be released later today, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports that the number is going to be lower than previously estimated.\xc2\xa0 And even though that suggests that we\xe2\x80\x99re moving in the right direction, the President thinks we still need to do a lot of work in order to get our fiscal house in order.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s taken a number of steps to do that already.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to work hard to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the right track.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you about the fact that giving special attention to these outside Republican groups like American Crossroads, the Rove-led groups, is actually helping them raise funds -- raise tons of funds, they say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Unless a bright light is shined on the shadowy activity of these outside groups, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to know the facts, which is that with their complete lack of transparency, lord knows who\xe2\x80\x99s participated in these races.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd the President thinks that if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to participate in politics, you ought to be transparent about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you concerned that they\xe2\x80\x99re helping them raise tons of money, as they say?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think a lot of that is overhyped and the sort of thing that you hear in political seasons.\xc2\xa0 But the President is committed to making sure that we have a political system where folks are being transparent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the foreclosures -- how concerned is the White House?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of turmoil in the markets about it.\xc2\xa0 And what is being considered, if anything?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is, of course, engaged and wants to make sure that these servicers live up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously supportive of the efforts that are happening in all 50 states by the attorneys general to investigate what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in their own states. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe fraud task force over at the Department of Justice is, of course, looking at this.\xc2\xa0 And the Attorney General himself said that if wrongdoing is found, appropriate action is going to be taken.\xc2\xa0 So the President is engaged and watching very closely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why would you spend so much time today for a candidate who is 20 points ahead in the polls?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specific politics of any of these individual races while we\xe2\x80\x99re on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that the President and the Vice President are going around the country and working very hard to elect candidates who will help to push forward on an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep our economy moving in the right direction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that -- the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that we ought to be taking any race -- or any voters ought to be taking any situation for granted.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to go out and wear his hat as leader of the Democratic Party here and around the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to Ohio, of course, this weekend.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going up to Boston this weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I just read you a range of places that we\xe2\x80\x99re going next week, so the President and the Vice President are going to quite a few different places.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have anything to do with the Vice President being from Delaware and also the Tea Party side of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that the state of Delaware is near and dear to the heart of Vice President Biden is certainly a factor; also near and dear to the heart of Dan Pfeiffer, who is on board with us today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details on it because I just saw news of it as we were taxiing, but there\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of action that you all have taken regarding allegations of unfair trade in China regarding the clean energy industry.\xc2\xa0 You may know more about it than I do.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I know enough to tell you that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reason?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- your colleagues ought to check in with USTR on that one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Christine O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell being a prominent face of the Tea Party, does that have anything to do with today\xe2\x80\x99s visit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think -- like I said, I think I just want to leave it at what I said, that the President and the Vice President are going places where they think that they can be helpful.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 See you guys in Delaware -- or Philly and then Delaware.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:11 P.M.
