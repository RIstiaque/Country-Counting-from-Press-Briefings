EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for joining us here this morning.\xc2\xa0 This will be a quick flight, and therefore a quick gaggle.\xc2\xa0 As we have done in the past, Jen and I will brief together.\xc2\xa0 I can answer your questions on policy and other matters related to the presidency and the administration.\xc2\xa0 Jen can take your questions on the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just guessing where your interests lie this morning.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 And with that, we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Two pieces I just wanted to highlight for you this morning -- one, you probably saw overnight that we have a new ad running in nine states, called "Firms."\xc2\xa0 It highlights Mitt Romney\'s record of outsourcing.\xc2\xa0 It also highlights his ownership of offshore accounts in tax havens.\xc2\xa0 That will be -- that\'s out this morning, again running in nine states.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also when you land, in your in-box will be a new web video that I wanted to highlight and actually play for you here today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it have singing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 It does not have singing, but I still think you\'ll find it entertaining.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney, I just want to remind you, is the same candidate who questioned whether the President understood America, questioned whether he understood freedom.\xc2\xa0 He spent a lot of time asking for apologies, but he spends a lot of time attacking, as you can see in this ad.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me play it here.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll have it in your in-box -- one second.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Plays video.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s obviously a response of a sort to the call for apology he did last night on all of the interviews that he did?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we felt it was important to remind people that Mitt Romney is the same candidate who just a few months ago was questioning whether the President understood America, understood freedom, and spent a lot of time -- and a lot of time on his campaign still to date -- attacking him.\xc2\xa0 And that was maybe forgotten over the last couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How big is the ad buy for those nine states?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a number specific for you.\xc2\xa0 It is running in nine states.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we get a range?\xc2\xa0 Is it more than a million?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\'re going to have that information for you, Hans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Less than a million?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will let you know if there\'s more to report.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they in major media markets in each of those nine states?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have more specific details for you.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure smart people at Bloomberg can find that information --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or CMAG, which we\'re --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Or CMAG.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get music rights?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The music rights over the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the singing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 For the singing?\xc2\xa0 That is an excellent question I\'m going to have to get back to you on.\xc2\xa0 I would assume so, and hope so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It could be a policy question we could toss to Jay because it could involve copyright.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe in copyright?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He certainly does.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\'s fought hard for copyright.\xc2\xa0 But on this specific issue, I\'ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Seriously, why choose the -- why kind of mock his singing in that ad?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The ad was a light way of highlighting Mitt Romney\'s record on outsourcing, his ownership of offshore accounts and tax havens.\xc2\xa0 It was meant to take a light approach to it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a serious note, though, does the President have concerns about the tone on both sides?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\'ve all written over the last several days how intense it\'s become, both sides accusing folks of lying and all of that.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern the President has?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what does he do about it unilaterally?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think when you see the President speak today, and when you saw -- anyone saw him speak yesterday, the President does focus his remarks on laying out the vision -- the differing visions that he has from Mitt Romney for the country -- what he wants to do for health care, what he wants to do for the economy, what he wants to do for education.\xc2\xa0 And he knows that\'s what the people of Virginia care about.\xc2\xa0 If you look at the front pages and coverage of his trip yesterday, that\'s very much what it\'s focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course the President wants to have a highbrow debate about these policy issues and what the American people actually care about.\xc2\xa0 We know that Mitt Romney is leading with his business credentials as his top qualification for being President.\xc2\xa0 And we think that it\'s completely justified to raise questions -- we have, many outside groups have, many media outlets have -- about why he had an account in Switzerland, why he had investments in the Cayman Islands, what exactly this corporation was in Bermuda.\xc2\xa0 And the American people deserve to know more about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t define a highbrow debate, does it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Those are raising questions about the qualifications he is putting forward of why he should be President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable that some people imply that Mitt Romney may have committed a felony?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 If you would look -- I would encourage everybody to look -- I know we\'ve been talking about this for a couple of days, but to look at specifically the transcript of what was said.\xc2\xa0 What was said was either he was misleading the American people, or he was misleading the SEC, which it would be a felony. Nobody -- she, Stephanie Cutter did not accuse anybody of taking -- of committing a felony.\xc2\xa0 She raised the issue that you can\'t have both.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No, she raised the issue of you can\'t have it either way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, at the end of the day, we\'re kind of missing the point of what this whole debate is about.\xc2\xa0 You may have seen, or I encourage you to read the Boston Globe story today, which raises additional questions.\xc2\xa0 The evidence is mounting.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s really what we should be talking about.\xc2\xa0 What is -- where are Mitt Romney\'s investments?\xc2\xa0 What is the truth?\xc2\xa0 Why can\'t we have more details?\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we want to have a conversation about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why is that relevant to a conversation about getting America working, as the Romney campaign wants to talk about?\xc2\xa0 That\'s changing the subject.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Because Mitt Romney is using his business credentials, his time at Bain, his time as governor, as the reason why he should be President.\xc2\xa0 So was he or wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he there? Can we learn more about which decisions he was involved in?\xc2\xa0 Can we learn more about his investments?\xc2\xa0 And those are the questions we\'re raising.\xc2\xa0 All of that tells a story of who someone is and who they\'ll be as President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As a matter of policy, Alister, you know what the President\'s position is on the choice between providing incentives to companies to outsource, or providing incentives to companies to insource, to help grow the economy in the United States and help it create jobs -- American jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a position the President has fought for throughout his presidency.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one that is pending before the United States Congress as part of his congressional "To-Do" list.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, there\'s been widespread Republican opposition to the simply proposition that we should alter our tax code in a way so that it no longer rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s pretty uniform Republican opposition to that position of the President.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a concrete matter of policy that affects what everybody agrees is the number-one issue facing the country today, which is the need to grow the economy and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re about to land in Eric Cantor\'s district.\xc2\xa0 Did the President or anyone from the White House given Eric Cantor a heads-up that the President is coming down?\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any recent conversations with the Mr. Cantor?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he\'s had any recent conversations with the Majority Leader, and I\'ll have to check on it in terms of notifications.\xc2\xa0 We put out word that the President was making this trip.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that we -- I\'ll have to check to see if any direct notifications were made from the White House to the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He won\'t be greeting us on the tarmac?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have to see.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question on Syria -- reporting that -- there\'s a flash report from the United Nations observer force in Syria that U.N. staff were physically prevented by the Syrian army from rescuing civilians from Tremseh where the massacre took place.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration aware of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that the national security staff and the overall national security team is aware of this report.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any confirmation of it.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like yet another affirmation of the fact the Bashar al-Assad continues to do everything he can to brutalize his own people, murder his own people, all with the goal of retaining power.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just another indication of how, no matter what he says and no matter what promises he makes, we have to see what he does and judge him by his actions, and thus far his actions have been revolting and heinous.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just another indication of why the international community needs to unify behind the proposition that a transition in Syria needs to take place without Assad in power.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, what\'s the title of the web video?\xc2\xa0 Does it have a title -- snappy, one word?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 "Mitt Romney Asking For Apologies While Launching Attacks."</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What else will the campaign be doing to promote that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 They\'ll be sending it out via social media.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll see it in your in-boxes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President tweet it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Twitter is something that should be a surprise, really keep you on your toes.\xc2\xa0 I will be tweeting it -- is that exciting?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 10:52 A.M.
