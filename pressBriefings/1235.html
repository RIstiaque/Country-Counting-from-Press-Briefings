EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 A few topics, please.\xc2\xa0 On the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Hispanic Caucus that\'s going on now, I assume -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a bit of detail about what the mission of that meeting is and whether -- well, I\'ll stop there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think we\'ll have a readout from the meeting when it concludes.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I think both the President and the congressional Hispanic caucus wanted to talk about a series of issues including how to move forward on a disappointing end to this session as it relates to the DREAM Act and what can be done in the next session.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that there is executive action that the President can take since that legislation fell short?<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Executive action to implement --<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically as it relates to what the DREAM Act was intended to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to check with counsel on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not entirely sure that executive action is -- my understanding is executive action cannot replace the legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is he confident broadly that there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness at all to take on a more comprehensive approach to immigration in the new year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as I said yesterday, Ben, it is the only way that we\'re going to solve many of the vexing problems around immigration.\xc2\xa0 And the only way to do that is for the federal government to debate and to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t be done with 50 states enacting a series of their own immigration laws, as we saw in the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision around Arizona.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On "don\'t ask, don\'t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d we talked yesterday about the big questions that are still out there about implementation, mainly when this law is really going to take effect.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to talk at all about that tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As the Secretary of Defense said, as soon as the law -- as soon as the repeal of the law is signed tomorrow morning, he will stand up an implementation working group that will be chaired by Dr. Clifford Stanley, who is our Under Secretary for Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and that starts that process.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, do you expect the President to -- how do you expect him to frame this tomorrow, to get into that type of discussion?\xc2\xa0 Or will he be talking more about the history-making nature of this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk more broadly about the nature of this and about why he thought, as many in Congress did, that it was important that this law be repealed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, a lot of us are wondering about the schedule this week.\xc2\xa0 Any update?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You and a certain man who sits in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 Again, tell me when Congress ends and I can give you a pretty good guess on when the President goes home, but not -- I don\'t expect it until then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Press conference?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing new on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On the foreign policy side, on North Korea, has North Korea, in fact, offered to allow U.N. nuclear inspectors back into the country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no update on what North Korea has offered.\xc2\xa0 I think North Korea has a pretty good sense of what they need to do to live up to their obligations.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, I think the world waits for them to do so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Staying with North Korea, the President has written to four senators to thank them for their support of ratifying START.\xc2\xa0 And in that letter, he referenced talks with the Russian Federation in the last two days about U.S. concerns with North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about those -- can you tell us about those talks, and were they anything to do with missile defense?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any more specifics than are in the letter on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last thing.\xc2\xa0 On Belarus, Belarus has jailed 600 protestors.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States have any way of influencing Belarus?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Alister, what I would point you to is the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement on the election and on the violence and on our belief that it must stop.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First of all, it appears as though you have the votes to ratify START, and I was wondering -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily appear that way days, if not weeks ago -- weeks if not days ago. What made the difference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think in all honesty I think people have had an opportunity to focus on what\xe2\x80\x99s in the treaty.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to focus on those that are supporting the treaty and listen to Chairman Mullen, Secretary Gates, Jim Baker, George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, and others make I think a very compelling case, along with the President and the Vice President, for why this enhances our security; why it does nothing to impact or inhibit our ability to defend ourselves in any way, as Senator Isakson said in a statement released just a few moments ago, announcing his support for ratification of this treaty.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think people understand that it is -- our reductions in these are legacies of many Presidents, including former President Ronald Reagan.\xc2\xa0 And it makes our world safer.\xc2\xa0 It provides, as we\'ve talked about in here, an inspection regime with the Russians.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inhibit our ability to protect ourselves using missile defense and promotes our security and stability in the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re approaching the end of the year and it looks as though the President may be departing for Hawaii soon.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any hints as to staff changes that might happen that you have been putting off until the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t expect you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear a lot before the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then lastly, as you know, there is a group of unemployed who have -- who call themselves the 99ers --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- these are individuals who have been -- whose unemployment insurance has run out.\xc2\xa0 They were not included in the deal, the tax deal that the President signed with Mr. McConnell and the Republicans and others.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that the President can do for them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the best thing that we can do as a country is get a fragile economy more stable and one that creates more jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why I think -- economists said that they would reorient their growth estimates based on the agreement that the President signed.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the best thing we can do for them is to create an environment where businesses are hiring. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, we have -- you heard me say on a number of occasions that one of the great benefits of the agreement was taking the politics out of unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 We have -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been a contentious battle just to get unemployment insurance to continue up to 99 weeks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not in any way been easy.\xc2\xa0 And this takes the politics out of that throughout 2011 and hopefully we can continue to focus on getting the economy moving again and providing those guys with a helping hand with a job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just ask a quick question about net neutrality.\xc2\xa0 The FCC has this proposal.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support a plan that, according to critics, would allow a carrier such as Verizon or any other carrier to block users from using a service that competes with a service they offer?\xc2\xa0 For instance, if Verizon doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer Google --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, let me do this.\xc2\xa0 I know the FCC as an independent agency is voting on this and the President will have a statement at the conclusion of that vote on their proposal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on one of Jake\xe2\x80\x99s questions, you have talked about how START has been reviewed and debated now for so many months.\xc2\xa0 So what was it that came up to the table now that sort of crystallized it for some of these senators who were still on the fence, if so much information was already out there for so long?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said yesterday, if people had questions about our commitment to modernizing our nuclear arsenal, if people had questions about the impact of this treaty -- the answer to that impact is none -- on missile defense, then we were happy to have anybody, everybody -- anybody and everybody provide that answer.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, General Cartwright, a whole host of foreign policy heavies from both political parties I think have weighed in on why this is important for our national security.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why I think you see now that we have been for a while and certainly are confident today that this is a treaty that will pass the Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was less about providing more information and more about sort of just big names endorsing this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think whenever you have somebody like Jim Baker or George Shultz or Henry Kissinger talking to senators on Capitol Hill about what they see is a benefit of the treaty I think that helps the treaty.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a combination of -- look, we understand that there has to be an orderly process by which a treaty is negotiated, considered, debated and ultimately voted on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that has happened in this case.\xc2\xa0 Senators have gotten the information that they\xe2\x80\x99ve needed.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty confident that more than two-thirds of them will vote to ratify something that\'s tremendously important for our national security. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On health care, top Republicans -- Senator McConnell and also Mr. Boehner -- have talked about next year pushing the repeal of the health care bill.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here at the White House in terms of preparing for that prospect -- I mean, what you think about this threat they keep making time and time again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that Senator McConnell and Congressman Boehner are going to have to answer questions from the American people about the benefits like ensuring that children aren\xe2\x80\x99t precluded from purchasing -- their families aren\xe2\x80\x99t precluded from purchasing health insurance because of a preexisting condition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s genuine benefits that the law provided to Americans that they\'re going to have to talk about what happens when you put insurance companies rather than families in charge of medical decisions.\xc2\xa0 I think those are decisions and messages that those two leaders and others in their caucus are going to have to figure out the answer to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will the White House be waging some sort of message campaign to counter that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you can assume that we continue to believe that the passage of the bill was a very important thing for the American people, for, as I just mentioned, millions of families whose children no longer have to -- they no longer have to lay awake at night wondering if their children can be covered by health insurance because they have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been wiped away.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if Republicans want to reinstitute insurance companies making those decisions on behalf of parents, that\'s an argument that they can try to make.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it will be a very successful one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Imminent release of the Census data raises the question of reapportionment, and given the size of Republican victories in many states, are you concerned that the Republicans will gerrymander the districts for even greater advantage in 2012?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I think that the -- look, and as you mentioned, I have not seen the full release of the data.\xc2\xa0 I think that comes between --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At 11:00 a.m. --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- I was going to say 11:15 a.m., but maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a better time.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I don\'t see why there\xe2\x80\x99s any reason why in a number of these places both parties can\xe2\x80\x99t be equally competitive and I don\'t think it will have a huge practical impact.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if Republicans have a large advantage in state legislatures, it may not be so competitive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We know that they do in a number of them.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have seen the map, but I also think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Southwestern and Southeastern states that have been purple in many elections, and that means the people in them make up their individual decisions based on who the candidates are and what the election is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but if the districts are redrawn, there may be fewer of the people who make the countervailing decision, make it a redder district.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, well, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make a redder -- you can\xe2\x80\x99t take a group of people and make all of them red if they\'re purple.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but if you can carve out some of the ones --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 But if you put all those in one place, it makes them less likely to be red in the other places.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a math thing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Magenta.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Aubergine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was also my question.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t expect a Texas kind of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that eggplant?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the color of eggplant.\xc2\xa0 I\'m trying to build off of magenta.\xc2\xa0 We\'re vamping for time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the Republican gains in November and the experience in Texas, aided by Mr. DeLay --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, how did that work out for him?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it did work out for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They got five seats.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It did work out for Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and he has an interesting viewpoint on each of those five seats.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\'s worked out so well for Mr. DeLay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it worked out for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And then is the Justice Department going to be looking at this?\xc2\xa0 Will the government look at these new boundaries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the full data will come out.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I would point you to the Justice Department.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get you on the record -- the report about U.S. military and/or NATO allied forces staging ground raids inside Pakistan --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the best thing to do is to quote ISAF. And let me read their release from last night, if I can find it in my stack.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no truth to the reporting in The New York Times that U.S. forces are planning to conduct ground operations into Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 ISAF and U.S. forces, along with their Afghan partners, have developed a strong working relationship with the Pakistan military to address shared security issues.\xc2\xa0 The coordination recognizes the sovereignty of Afghanistan and Pakistan to pursue insurgents and terrorists operating in their respective border areas.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was another report about a plan to poison food with contaminants like ricin.\xc2\xa0 How real is that threat?\xc2\xa0 Is it a credible threat?\xc2\xa0 And what steps, if any, are being taken to head it off?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I would say that while not giving in to commenting on specific intelligence, or what might be specific planning, we take -- our counterterrorism and Homeland Security officials take every credible threat very seriously.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s significant planning for a coordination to prevent unconventional attacks using chemical, biological or radiological weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to remain vigilant to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing all that we can to prevent it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, yesterday, an environmental group came out with a report that Washington, D.C. was among localities with contaminated water -- hexavalent chromium.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern here in the White House that water is contaminated in Washington? Not only -- I mean, aside from the city at large, here in this complex?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of -- not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of in here.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to EPA for a response on the specifics to the report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, some of the other perhaps 2012 Republican contenders, came out against START, New START; they came out against the tax deal, and these things look like they were going to be passed with significant --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, some of them --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yes, right -- with significant Republican support.\xc2\xa0 What do you make of the split that might be happening between the run for 2012 and what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Washington?\xc2\xa0 And where do you think that\'s going to take the GOP into next year?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there will be great pressure on those in Washington as those outside of Washington ramp up their rhetoric around 2012.\xc2\xa0 But I think if people believe that the message from the election in 2012 is to seek less cooperation, more gridlock and greater partisanship, I think that is taking the very -- that is taking the wrong message from the last election.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What people want is -- and I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen public polling that what people are looking for is parties that will fight for their values, but can work together to find common ground, to compromise, and to get something done that moves the economy forward and benefits the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- I think that\'s what people asked for in this election, and I think in many ways over the past couple weeks, that\'s provided a good formula to get things done in this town.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think there will be great pressure to do otherwise as people begin running for President.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think that there will be plenty of time with which to conduct a presidential election in the fall of 2012.\xc2\xa0 But I think what the American people are looking for in this town are people not to focus on their own political futures, but focus on the future of the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And along those lines, the CR does not have any money for implementing the health care plan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It does not have any increases for the SEC or the CFTC to implement the Wall Street reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How are you going to get that money?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say, Jonathan, that, look, anytime you have a short-term measure to fund the yearlong capacity of government, it creates complications.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I said late last week that a short-term continuing resolution was something that was far less than ideal in providing the needed certainty, but that over the course of the next several months, Jack Lew and our budget office will work with Congress to ensure the necessary funding for critical government operations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Knoller.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the \xe2\x80\x9899ers, are they just out of luck that benefits don\'t extend to them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mark, I think as you know the Recovery Act extended benefits beyond where they had previous been up to 99 weeks.\xc2\xa0 The last extension -- and I forget if it\xe2\x80\x99s from 72 or 76 to 99 weeks -- but those are dependent upon the unemployment rates in those states.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe have fought for extending, as you know, in the Recovery Act, extending that up to 99 weeks and continuing that full benefit through next year.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the best thing that we can do is to help -- and I think the agreement does that -- to help create an environment for economic growth and economic progress and putting people back to work.\xc2\xa0 I think that is first and foremost our commitment to them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the signing tomorrow at Interior?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A host of reasons.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, holiday tours here make it very difficult to close the East Room.\xc2\xa0 The Interior Department -- not knowing the exact schedule, the Interior Department provided a location that was easy to get to and I think the space is big enough for a signing of this size.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there plans for the President to meet with Governor Richardson when he returns from North Korea?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Governor Richardson is on a private trip and there are no plans that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just following up on Alister\xe2\x80\x99s question, what does the administration make of the offers North Korea has made to Bill Richardson?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- we have throughout many months and even many years, dating back to different administrations, seen the words and the rhetoric of the North Koreans fail to live up to any of their actions or their obligations.\xc2\xa0 So, speeches and rhetoric aside, the obligations that they must undertake as part of a respected member of the international community -- they\'re aware of what they need to do.\xc2\xa0 And commitments to do so are not what we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re interested in them living up to those obligations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there any indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re closer to the restart of six-party party talks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Six-party talks will be restarted again when the North Koreans display a willingness to change their behavior.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get a table in a room and talk -- have six-party talks just for the feel-good notion of having six-party talks.\xc2\xa0 When and if the North Koreans are ever serious about living up to their obligations, then we can think about restarting six-party talks.\xc2\xa0 But the belligerent actions that the North Koreans have demonstrated over the past many weeks I don\'t think provide anybody the confidence that they\'re even remotely ready to resume in a responsible way those talks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd when they are, then the world will be ready to do what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 But right now the action must come not from their words, but from their deeds.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other thing.\xc2\xa0 Any update on who the President is reaching out to on START, which senators he\xe2\x80\x99s talked with?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For their reasons and for -- we continue to -- I will continue to tell you the President has made calls, but not get into who.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department released a list of senators that Secretary Clinton called, but you\xe2\x80\x99re taking a different approach?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Indeed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Whistleblower Protection Act could come up for a vote today or tomorrow in the House.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s already passed the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is this on a list of things the President would like to accomplish during the lame duck?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from legislative affairs.\xc2\xa0 My sense is, yes, but I would need to just get a little final guidance from them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also any further guidance on the 9/11 first responders bill and likelihood that it will pass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, a question not for me or any Democrat on Capitol Hill, but for Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d remind people that this was -- 58 Democratic senators voted for this legislation; 42 Republican senators voted against this legislation.\xc2\xa0 The only way to get to 60 is to add two of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President made any calls on this bill?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President came out in August in support of this bill.\xc2\xa0 We released a statement before the House voted in August in support of this bill.\xc2\xa0 We released a statement in December before the Senate voted on this bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ari, it\xe2\x80\x99s not up -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the Democrats.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying he\xe2\x80\x99s calling senators to lobby them on START -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not calling senators to lobby them on this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ari, I don\'t -- I think Mitch McConnell and Republicans ought to pick up the phone and talk to each other about this.\xc2\xa0 Every Democrat is for this bill.\xc2\xa0 Fifty-eight Democratic senators out of 58 Democratic senators support this bill.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no Democratic senator and no Democrat on Capitol Hill that\'s standing in the way of this becoming law.\xc2\xa0 There are 42 Republicans that are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People are talking about it as a measure of Jon Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s political clout.\xc2\xa0 Any thoughts on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think if there\xe2\x80\x99s the ability for that to sort of break through in our political environment, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance that he can help do that.\xc2\xa0 I think he has put the awareness around this legislation -- he\xe2\x80\x99s put that awareness into what you guys cover each day, and I think that\'s good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hope he can convince two Republicans to support taking care of those that took care of so many on that awful day in our history.\xc2\xa0 It seems at the end of a long year, around the holiday season, a pretty awful thing to play politics about.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a decision that 42 Republican senators are going to have to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Far fewer federal judges have been confirmed in your first two years than the first years of President Clinton or President Bush.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 Do you all blame that purely on the Senate Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Or do you think -- or is the President going to make a bigger push on that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get the numbers and take a look at the final -- look, I think we have had -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been quite a bit of problem in getting judges considered on a timely basis with a minority in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s been true for virtually every personnel position that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have judges that go through the judiciary committee unanimously and languish, waiting for unanimous consent to come up before the Senate for hundreds of days.\xc2\xa0 Again, when, Ari calls the Republicans to ask them about the 9/11 bill, you should hop on the line and ask them about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 In Secretary Clinton acknowledging who she\xe2\x80\x99s talked to among the senators, and the President -- you all not willing to release that, are you acknowledging that she might be more popular among Republicans than the President is, and therefore --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because she\xe2\x80\x99s -- because of the list being released of who -- is it an acknowledgement that maybe Bob Corker doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be known his vote could change depending on whether Obama calls him or not, is my question --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m having a hard time seeing that connection of that bridge.\xc2\xa0 But --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how many calls?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A lot.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A number?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say before I take Sheryl\xe2\x80\x99s question, that inexplicably the transcript said that I called you \xe2\x80\x9cJill\xe2\x80\x9d yesterday, which I don\'t have any idea why I would have said that.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s what the tape and the transcript said, and I apologize.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, thank you, George.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\'re welcome.\xc2\xa0 She told me she was going to say that, so that was a little -- I\'m the setup guy for Linda\xe2\x80\x99s joke today -- I mean Sheryl\xe2\x80\x99s joke today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any idea how Jill even popped out -- but go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have talked about bipartisanship here today -- or sort of the new bipartisanship that we seem to be seeing in Washington on the tax deal, on "don\'t ask, don\'t tell," you got eight Republicans, and now it just seems that on START you\xe2\x80\x99ll get some breaking away from the party leadership.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if the President has given any thought to what accounts for this, and especially his own role.\xc2\xa0 You might say that he has always said he was willing to work with them and they\xe2\x80\x99re now just coming over and agreeing to do so, but I\'m wondering if he\xe2\x80\x99s thought about any changes in his own behavior that might account for this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think a couple things on that, Sheryl.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously the President, as I said -- when I say what I think the American people wanted after that election was two parties to work together, that\'s exactly what the President took from that election.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that -- I think the President would admit that he spent more time reaching out to Republicans recently than in previous times.\xc2\xa0 And he admitted as much to the Republicans when they were here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also happen to think that Republicans understand probably more than they have in any other period also in the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure that they are soon to inherit a great responsibility for the act of governing, and I think that\'s kicked in a bit earlier than the formal passing of the gavel in the House. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the message you have to take from what happened in November is that people want Washington to put aside the games that it normally plays and get things done.\xc2\xa0 I think that what has been accomplished over the past few weeks demonstrates certainly that that\'s possible.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow on Perry\xe2\x80\x99s question, I think the point he was trying to make and what I would ask is, is the fact that the White House is not revealing who the President is calling an indication that while Republican senators might not mind it being known that they spoke to Hillary Clinton, they might not want it to be known that they spoke to President Obama on this and that his comments might have swayed their views?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it a concern of yours that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 We want to see the START treaty ratified.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s relation to South Korea military fire exercise in Yeonpyeong Island and the territory against North Korea?\xc2\xa0 And also, will the United States continue to support South Korea?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 South Korea is one of our most important allies in the region and throughout the world.\xc2\xa0 We are fully supportive of their actions and will continue to work hand in hand with them to counter the belligerent actions of the North in order to provide security not just to the people of the Republic of Korea but to provide stability throughout the region and throughout the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Goyal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, as far as presidential visit was concerned, to India, across the street Mr. Ron Somers -- where President addressed a group in Mumbia, U.S.-India Business Council, he is thanking the President and the team, as far as addressing his group and business -- as far as U.S.-India business is concerned.\xc2\xa0 Now, my question is, where do we go from there?\xc2\xa0 Because presidential statement, also announcement in the parliament about U.N. Security Council seat for India.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to take an active role to expand --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, I think around the announcement of our support for India\xe2\x80\x99s membership, we discussed and talked about the fact that there is a reform process that\xe2\x80\x99s underway at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 But our belief was that India was and should be an important part of that body.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to support that.\xc2\xa0 And as the U.N. considers that reform, I\'m sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take into account what the President and other nations have said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Overall, where do we stand as far as U.S.-India relations are concerned under President Obama?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think as you heard the President discuss on the trip to India, that the hallmark of our country\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with India is not one that -- or I should say, to frame it in a positive -- is one that is important to this country not because of one particular President or one particular party.\xc2\xa0 President Clinton obviously made a historic trip to India.\xc2\xa0 President Bush, in the civilian nuclear deal, was an important step in our bilateral relationship.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip recently in November was another building block on an important relationship in the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, if I may.\xc2\xa0 As far as WikiLeaks is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Actually a third.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go on to Josh for a second. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJosh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you tell us what kinds of things the White House has been doing to try to get the Guantanamo trials and transfer ban language stripped out of the CR or the defense bill? Has the President been making any calls --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check and see if the President -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Attorney General has sent letters.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else he\xe2\x80\x99s done.\xc2\xa0 I\'d point you to DOJ.\xc2\xa0 But I can check on what the President has done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House and the whole administration has been sort of wrapped around the axle on the issue of the 9/11 trial for almost a year now.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be relief to have a measure like this passed and therefore not have to make a decision about where to send those defendants and simply have the decision made for you, basically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a decision on what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of this country and what\xe2\x80\x99s also constitutional.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two brief questions on START.\xc2\xa0 Admiral Mullen, of course, put out a very strong statement about it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned General Hoss Cartwright\xe2\x80\x99s briefings and his comments on it.\xc2\xa0 Do either Admiral Mullen or General Cartwright actually make calls or talk to senators themselves?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe both of them have.\xc2\xa0 DOD probably has better eyes into that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my impression that both of them have spoken with senators, either individuals or as a group, in order -- again, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at, for both of those individuals as those that can provide a perspective -- a military perspective on the treaty writ large and any language that they have questions about in the treaty, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ve done so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My other question is -- just a follow-up from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I asked you whether the U.S. would continue to operate within the parameters of START. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 John, what I should have said yesterday was that it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that I\'d consider answering when and if that happened.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, do you have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow on that.\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved an alert saying nine Republicans now say they will back the START treaty, virtually assuring ratification.\xc2\xa0 Can I get your reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 And is this now a done deal, as you see it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, look, I am -- we remain extremely confident that this is a treaty that the Senate will believe is in the best interest of our national security in reducing nuclear tensions and in providing an important inspection regime on the Russian arsenal.\xc2\xa0 And because of all those reasons, we think the Senate will pass and ratify the START treaty in the next day or so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So we were talking earlier about bipartisanship and what the voters wanted after November.\xc2\xa0 But one thing that struck me about the way the President has used the lame duck is that he\xe2\x80\x99s looked to Republicans to make the case for him to other Republicans a lot.\xc2\xa0 In \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Gates was the guy making the case.\xc2\xa0 In New START, it was a lot of former Republican secretaries of state or what have you making the case.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering, is this the model that you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn more toward in -- next year on other issues?\xc2\xa0 What might those issues be, immigration, whatever?\xc2\xa0 And does he have a feeling -- is it his sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s more pragmatism in Republicans outside of Congress than there is in Republicans inside of Congress these days?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, on the second one, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat -- some of that would depend I think largely on what group of others you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 I do think that -- look, I think, to answer your first question, I think when you sort of peel away the political rhetoric and the political back-and-forth, you find that there are, on a host of issues, important things that we all can agree on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think one of the issues that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see some bipartisan work on and some agreement on in the future is education reform and education reauthorization.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been that -- I, quite frankly, think that the work that\xe2\x80\x99s gone on at the Department of Education in education reform over the past two years probably hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten a lot of publicity largely because there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan agreement on education reform, on the steps that states are taking to change the way we educate our children.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of an issue that, in the next Congress, there\xe2\x80\x99s a really good opportunity and a really good chance for Democrats and Republicans to work together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you see him looking more to Republican governors, since there are now so many more of them, to make the case for him on some policy initiatives?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that much of this time around.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think if you look at the Recovery Act, certainly Governor Douglas and Governor Crist were important endorsements for, or validators for, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President is going to make a series of decisions that -- of policies that he thinks are in the best interest of the American people, and try to put together and find a coalition of likeminded individuals on either side of the political spectrum that agree.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done over the past few weeks, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99ll look to continue to do next year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I try another one real quick?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple days ago I\'d asked you if you had to sum up what the lessons or sort of political takeaway from the lame duck was, what it would be, and you said, \xe2\x80\x9cAsk me in 72 hours.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Has it been 72 hours?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s close, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached cloture --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\'d change a little bit of what I just said.\xc2\xa0 I think that the American people want to see this town able to break out of the political games that it\xe2\x80\x99s become known for, to find solutions that are in the best interest of the people and to go about making those solutions a reality; not to play more partisan games, not to have more gridlock, not to see us focused, as I said earlier, on the next election, but on the future that\xe2\x80\x99s in front of us.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stephen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How seriously is the administration taking this report released today in the Senate on the Lockerbie bombing?\xc2\xa0 And does it concur with the findings that the Blair/Brown government pressured the Scots to release --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, let me get some -- I have not seen the report before coming out here.\xc2\xa0 But let me have Mike get some information on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on foreign policy, what was the reaction of President when he got the letter from Prime Minister of Turkey who mentioned about serious concern on Armenian resolution in Congress?\xc2\xa0 Has the President talked with any congressional leader, calling Nancy Pelosi to oppose this one?\xc2\xa0 Or if the Armenian resolution passes in Congress, do you have any concern future relationship with Turkey?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously our relationship -- our bilateral relationship with Turkey is enormously important.\xc2\xa0 I do not know that the President -- I do not believe that the President has made any calls specifically on this, and I think his views on this are known.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned education reform.\xc2\xa0 Can you take us inside any other specifics early next year, any other priorities that are going to come up first on the docket?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m going to let the State of the Union take some care of that as we get closer to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just following on Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question a little bit, the President set certain priorities for the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 In the last couple of weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the tax deal concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d signed tomorrow, the food safety legislation.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have put a release on 19 of your judicial appointments.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re now going to get the START treaty. I think everybody would have to say that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good performance.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to take a victory lap?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President, like me, is extremely superstitious.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is important to continue to work toward getting those things done, and I anticipate the President will have an occasion to speak about his two years and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished in the last few weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At a press conference on Thursday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
