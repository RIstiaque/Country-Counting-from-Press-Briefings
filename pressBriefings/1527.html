Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  \xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">12:43 P.M. EDT<br/> <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Ms. Levin.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us the current plans and the thinking about getting President Obama together with President Clinton about North Korea?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We talked a little bit about this this morning. I know when the President -- let me make sure I\'m specific -- when President Obama spoke yesterday morning with President Clinton, President Obama expressed his desire to get together fairly soon so the two men would have a chance to talk.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we have described to you all, the members of the NSC briefed former President Clinton prior to his trip.\xc2\xa0 There will\xc2\xa0 -- there has been and will continue to be a formal debriefing process now on the back end of that trip.\xc2\xa0 There were some communications between the former President and the NSC yesterday, and that will continue over the next several days.\xc2\xa0 I know they want to get together.\xc2\xa0 Right now we\'re just trying to coordinate the schedules of two rather busy men.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it fair to say that the NSC staff will talk to President Clinton and gather all the information that needs to be gathered, and that after that point, then the two Presidents will get together and discuss whatever it is or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have -- there\'s nothing currently scheduled.\xc2\xa0 I would put these in many ways on two different tracks.\xc2\xa0 They could certainly happen simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s our desire to get whatever impressions President Clinton has.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is this happening in person, on the phone?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Last night it happened on the phone.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if future ones will happen in person or not.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I will say this, and obviously I was not part of the debriefing last night, but if you look at where historically President Clinton has been -- and I don\'t have any knowledge of what was debriefed or talked about, but I can only imagine that given his history on this issue, that he would strongly encourage the North Koreans to set aside their renewed pursuit of a nuclear weapon, come back and live by the agreements that they\'ve been party to before, and to encourage them to understand that the acquisition of those weapons is not going to bring international prestige but further isolation based on his history on these issues.<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more quick one on this.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have any indications, whether through the start of this debriefing with President Clinton or other channels, that North Koreans want anything in return for the pardon?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t been party to these negotiations and I haven\'t heard of anything.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you give us an idea as to the administration\'s timetable on reforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and any details on the way you\'re leaning?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously as part of financial regulatory reform, GSE reform is going to be part of that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously these were mentioned in the white paper that the administration released on regulatory reform -- there was a discussion of this on pages 41 and 42 of that reform.\xc2\xa0 The story out today is light-years ahead of any decision-making process here.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no meeting that\'s scheduled, and it\'s safe to say that many senior administration economic officials learned of this proposal some time this morning at the foot of their driveway.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean there\'s not a proposal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, staff are certainly -- as I\'ve said through financial regulatory reform, staff are aware of the problem and working on it as a part of financial regulatory reform.\xc2\xa0 I think to assume that either this is at a point of even a decision by senior economic officials, let alone anybody that occupies the Oval Office, is way, way ahead of itself.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a time frame in mind specifically for those two companies for reform?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific timetable.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly look into that.\xc2\xa0 Again, I know it\'s certainly part of a broader financial regulatory reform, and obviously both play an important role in the President\'s home loan modification program and overall housing policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some foreign policy experts have wondered about the precedence set by President Clinton\'s trip to North Korea, the humanitarian mission, as you guys describe it -- about whether or not it would mean that other rogue states making a similar request in a similar situation -- and it\'s not too hard to see a fairly close parallel with what\'s going on in Iran right now -- whether that would now merit a visit from somebody of President Clinton\'s prestige.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering, A, if that was a concern before you guys signed off on this trip, and B, what your response is to that criticism.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'ve described this and others as separate from the concerns that we had about North Korea, its nuclear policy, its provocative international actions.\xc2\xa0 And I think our policy to ensure that U.N. Security Council regulations are implemented is no different today than it was Monday before President Clinton left.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was a private humanitarian mission with only the goal of bringing back two journalists to safety.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t read a lot of precedent into it.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is enormously thankful and grateful for the work that President Clinton did on this, and his willingness to undertake such an important mission. But that\'s what this was about.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think the administration has taken very strong action relating to and responding to the actions of the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 I think what happened in the U.N. Security Council, the unanimous passage of those resolutions and the impact that they have already had on ensuring that the North Koreans are unable to move weapons out of their country, quite frankly is the best response for anybody\'s criticism.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then Senator Cornyn sent you guys a letter expressing concern about the tips at whitehouse.gov and what that meant, what exactly you were seeking in terms of disinformation. I got a statement from Linda Douglass earlier, and I assume that, just from what she suggests in her response, you guys are not going to be saving the names or the IP addresses, anything along those lines --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nobody is collecting names.\xc2\xa0 This was -- we have seen and as I\'ve discussed from this podium, a lot of misinformation around health care reform, some of it I think spread purposefully.\xc2\xa0 We have used on many occasions the Web site to debunk things that are simply not true.\xc2\xa0 We ask people if they have questions about health care reform and about what they\'re hearing about its effects on them to let us know and we provide them information to show that that wasn\'t true.\xc2\xa0 But nobody is collecting names.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in -- is it misinformation that in 2003, President Obama, then a state senator, supported a single-payer health care system?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, if you look at the statements that have been put up on other Internet sites that splice a bunch of stuff together, and I think if you look at the answers that state senator, U.S. senator, and President Barack Obama have given on that -- I think we hope to provide people with a full and accurate picture, not something that only the words opponents want might to see.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 The President meeting with the six senators, bipartisan-group senators -- what was his message to them and what is the sort of expectation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President invited the group to come to the White House today to provide an update and a status report of sorts on their negotiations amongst themselves in the committee. The President\'s message to them is to continue to work and find consensus on an issue that we know they\'ve been working hard on and is very important to the American people.\xc2\xa0 The President wants them to continue to work and make progress, and wanted to hear directly from them on where they were.\xc2\xa0 It wasn\'t a negotiating session.\xc2\xa0 The meeting just recently broke up and I don\'t have -- I have not had a chance to talk to the President since the conclusion of that meeting.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no sense as to how close they are?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have one yet, no.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of -- I know in an interview yesterday, the President suggested that -- it appeared that he\'s losing patience when it comes to bipartisanship and getting the kind of bill that can be supported by Republicans and Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Is he losing patience pushing bipartisanship in saying that he might have to forego that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\'s actions today, the invitation that came from him to a bipartisan group of senators to come and discuss where they were on health care denotes that he\'s serious about getting something through Congress and he\'s serious about doing so in a way that brings about a large coalition.\xc2\xa0 I\'d say, Dan, that if you look at even some of the Finance Committee statements from earlier in the year, they had wanted to come to some agreement in June.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'ve reached warmer months than June without that.\xc2\xa0 So the President simply wanted an update.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I will say this:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is very serious about getting something done -- I know he is -- about getting something done this year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been his goal all along.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With or without Republicans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 With those that want to see health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\'am.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see any potentiality for improving relations with this North Korean move? How come we don\'t know anything that led up to it, if there\'s any quid pro quo or anything else?\xc2\xa0 We\'re so in the dark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there was no quid pro quo.\xc2\xa0 I think we, on a call, went through in fairly exhaustive detail, step by step, how the invitation came for President Clinton to go when we were notified about that.\xc2\xa0 Again, Helen, whether or not --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You let them make all the announcements, show all the pictures.\xc2\xa0 They took total control of --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not you, per se.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say, I have less control over the North Korean television cameras than even I had hoped.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You, representing the United States, that is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right, exactly.\xc2\xa0 No, look, obviously we took great care while this was going on to ensure that our ultimate goal was success.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and the team here will have a chance to hear directly from President Clinton about what he heard and saw.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously anxious to get that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I\'d say again, Helen, I think what is crucially important to understand -- whether or not North Korea wants a better relationship we\'ll certainly find out -- they have the power, though, to change that relationship.\xc2\xa0 They have the power to come back to the set of agreements that they entered into to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 That\'s our goal.\xc2\xa0 We think that\'s the international community\'s goal based on their reaction to some of the provocative, if not outlandish, statements and actions that the North Koreans have taken.\xc2\xa0 They have the ability and the power to do that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We certainly, regardless of this mission or not, we certainly hope that they\'ll come back to implementing the agreements that they entered into, while at the same time we will continue to take the steps necessary to enforce Security Council resolutions to ensure the weapons of mass destruction are not spread by the North Koreans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of -- just one more question --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- of the policy, are we only against people who might get the weapons and not against those who have already gotten them and could use them?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the spread of -- the President has said numerous times, the spread of a weapon of mass destruction, the spread of nuclear materiel and nuclear weapons is our number-one worry and cause of concern for national security.\xc2\xa0 He has outlined a series of very aggressive steps as it relates to nuclear proliferation that we will continue to work toward and implement over the course of the next many months and years.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously we have great concern in a nation that would try to acquire, as we would a group trying to get a hold of a weapon inside of a nation that already has those weapons.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on health care.\xc2\xa0 You said the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw any lines in the sand on public option, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that put Democrats in a quandary when they go home and they hold town hall meetings and they talk to constituents and they say, where do you stand on a public option -- they don\'t know what to say because they don\'t know where it\'s going to end up, they don\'t know what the President is going to ultimately -- if they say, yes, I support a public option, and they come back in the fall and it\'s not on the table anymore, then they\'ve put themselves out on a limb for no reason.\xc2\xa0 Aren\xe2\x80\x99t you making things politically difficult for Democrats by not saying, yes, he wants a public option in there, period?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\'ve outlined our principles.\xc2\xa0 What\'s most important here is, as I\'ve said here a bunch, we get choice and competition in what can tend to be a very restricted market for private insurance.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I have not noticed down the street a shortage of personal opinion, one way or the other.\xc2\xa0 So I think if somebody is asked about where they sit or stand on that issue, I have no doubt that each member up there has their own opinion.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they do, but for Blue Dogs, for example, it\'s a very delicate issue and they\'re not going to want to go out on a limb on a public option and then have that limb sawed off when they come back in the fall.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What I think is important, Chip, is if we continue to work and continue to make progress, we\'ll be able to go home by the end of the year and explain to every constituent the steps that were taken to get health care reform for every single American.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the most important discussion.\xc2\xa0 We want to see progress continue to move forward.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why the President had the meeting here today, to get an update on where the Senate Finance Committee is.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, there are a lot of different opinions on a lot of different issues and we\'ll continue to work through those as we get closer to health care reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on -- do you have anything on the unemployment benefits numbers that came out today?\xc2\xa0 And in addition to that, you touched on this on Monday, but what is going on behind the scenes?\xc2\xa0 How much work is being done and how dedicated is this White House to extending unemployment --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take the questions a little separately here.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously -- look, I think as you see a lot of these statistics that come out each and every week, you can see positive signs and you can see continued signs for concern.\xc2\xa0 Four-week average for first-time unemployment claims is down less than the market expected in first-time weekly claims. Again, we look at -- I think what\'s important to do also is look at some of that four-week average because that smoothes out particularly some of the seasonal differences.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, you continue to have a growing number and record number receiving those long-term benefits.\xc2\xa0 That brings us to your second question, which is over the course of between now and the end of the year, you are going to have different people, based on the length of time on each of the receiving unemployment insurance, you will have people exhaust that benefit.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very concerned about that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\'s been a -- was a big part of the Recovery Act and something that we want to see, and I think there\'s bipartisan support to see, continued.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\'re also looking at working to continue benefits that were extended as part of the recovery plan itself. Two different -- both kind of a short-term and more of a medium- to long-term issue that the administration is concerned about and wants to work with Congress to ensure that we are continuing to help those that are victims of a struggling economy who are looking and actively participating in a job search to help support their families.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re definitely committed to that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is passing that a top priority?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has said that when all is said and done he expects that the unemployment rate will top 10 percent.\xc2\xa0 Does he still believe that?<br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Whether that happens tomorrow, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Again, for my friends in the Council of Economic Advisers, I don\'t know anything on the specific numbers.\xc2\xa0 I expect we\'ll see several hundred thousand jobs lost.\xc2\xa0 I expect that we\'ll see an uptick in that unemployment rate come tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had a follow-up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your economic advisors who had fanned out on Sunday across the talk shows, there was talk that the economic growth rate needs to be around 2.5 percent in order to see some of this -- these same jobs being built back into the economy.\xc2\xa0 Is that the operating threshold that you\'re looking at?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what they were talking about in some ways were sort of historical mathematical conclusions.\xc2\xa0 I know there have been articles, as well.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got to see a growth rate at a certain level, and quite frankly, you\'ve got to see job creation point at a certain level in order simply to maintain an unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 If it were to -- let\'s say it were to get to 9.6 or 9.7 -- in order to see that happening again, month after month, you\'d actually have to be continuing to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I think the President believes this will creep up and soon hit and exceed 10.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are obviously working to do all that we can to create growth, to lay the foundation for long-term job creation in order to see jobs created and the unemployment rate come down.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And a follow on health care.\xc2\xa0 I\'m new around here so I get a little confused.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President meeting with Democrats and Republicans means the President is interested in doing this, first and foremost, through regular order.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the option for reconciliation was contained in the budget agreement, and we\'d certainly crossed that bridge when we got to it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s hanging out there like a sword of Damocles over these Senate negotiations.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, and I think that\'s -- I think I -- I hope I previewed that enough.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think if you simply look at where he has always been on this issue and on the agreements and the work that he did with Kim Jong-il\'s father on denuclearization, I\'m simply extrapolating from that.\xc2\xa0 I have not been -- I have not heard the debrief on the specific conversations or what impressions the former President left North Korea with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have kind of a clean-up question on that, too.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that the President would be getting his Clinton briefing before he leaves for Mexico on Sunday?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, timing aside, I think the good doctor -- both Romer and the good mythical doctor they were speaking about -- said exactly what we\'ve all said, which is, first and foremost, our focus is on implementing the Recovery Act that Congress passed.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, we will continue to monitor the economic situation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">If there are ideas that the President or the economic team believe can and should be taken in order to accelerate the recovery and to lay that foundation, we\'ll certainly take a look at that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, I don\'t anticipate anything new in the near term, except as I said, the implementation of the recovery plan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Romer was also asked directly to say whether or not the President would raise taxes on the middle class in his first term.\xc2\xa0 Her initial reaction was, "Can I go now?"\xc2\xa0 Then she said, well, the first priority is to lower costs on government through health care.\xc2\xa0 But at no point did she say the President would not raise taxes on the middle class in the first term.\xc2\xa0 This would now be the third economic advisor of the President who, given the opportunity to say declaratively that would not happen, has not.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- has it changed since that time?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s preference on a health care plan he had an opportunity to outline, debate, and discuss in an almost two-year campaign for President from 2007 to 2008.</div> <div class="legacy-para">April.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, going back to two questions, one on unemployment, you said that you were still expecting the unemployment rate for mainstream America to hit 10 percent.\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting the unemployment rate for black America to still hit 20 percent by the end of this year?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what the number will be.\xc2\xa0 Again, I expect that it is -- I think we\'ve done briefings on this in terms of recovery and things like that, and expect that the unemployment rate will continue to rise for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific number.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that the President has characterized a specific number for African Americans.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For obvious reasons, there\'s a reason why the black unemployment is singled out.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re saying it will go up.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect, though, that it will stay double that of mainstream America -- mainstream Americans?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some guidance from the econ guys on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then on --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You need to call them anyway, don\'t you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Apparently.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then on the issue of the Supreme Court, what is the work that the White House is doing now for the next possible Obama pick for another justice for the Supreme Court?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any news to report on the notion -- on what happens next if there is another vacancy.\xc2\xa0 I do know the President is -- as we talked about this morning, you will hear from the President today directly if, as we expect, Judge Sotomayor becomes Justice Sotomayor today.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously you commend Democrats and Republicans for getting her -- hopefully -- confirmed in a very timely way in order for her to participate in the Court\'s activities in September with the hearing of the case that\'s been held over, and in the work that they\'ll do before the session begins, the Court\'s term begins, to pick the important cases that they\'ll work on next year.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re enormously proud of the bipartisan support that she\'s likely to get.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Once again, going back to the work that the White House is doing, is it possibly something -- I understand that the work was happening in the transition, possibilities if this President were to become President.\xc2\xa0 So would it be just a continued --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in the transition it was pretty clear he was going to become President, but, yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, well, even before you guys officially announced the transition, before he was even President-elect, we understand you guys were working on possibilities.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m saying is once he became --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to check that.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'ll play along.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it just a continuation from prior to arriving at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, from the work that you did then to now for a possible next pick?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I\'m not trying to be squirrelly.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I have not heard any discussion about work that has happened above and beyond work that had happened prior to the President\'s announcement of Judge Sotomayor in anticipation of the possibility of additional picks.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ve got -- obviously, there were a number of names out there and that pool continues.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Middle East.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration asked Israel to freeze settlements for one year in order to encourage the Arab states to offer concessions and normalizations?\xc2\xa0 There\'s a couple of reports out there in Israel today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- without getting into any specifics, the President has been clear in outlining the steps he believes that Israelis, Palestinians, and Arab states should take in order to achieve a lasting Middle East peace, and that includes a freeze on settlements.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, ahead of tomorrow\'s unemployment report, I just want to make sure I understood something you said before.\xc2\xa0 You\'re obviously very concerned about helping everyone find a job, and yet when you describe the unemployment figure, you don\'t use the higher figure that reflects those very workers.\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the Labor Department\'s U3 rate, which is 9.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t the real unemployment rate that reflects people who are really struggling and can only find part-time work -- that\'s 16.5 percent.\xc2\xa0 So why don\'t you use the higher standard if it\'s more accurate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know what Mike\'s question -- I think Mike\'s question was based on -- well, since Mike was asking me whether it was going to go to 10, I assumed the figure he was using was the one that hadn\'t at that point eclipsed 10, since that would be a little redundant.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Understand that unemployment figures only denote, as you said, people that are -- that have -- that continue to look for work and don\'t consider themselves so unlikely to find work that they\'ve stopped looking.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that one figure, whether it\'s those that have stopped, those that are underemployed, those that wish to be working full-time and are working part-time, or just those that simply the Bureau of Labor Statistics say are employed or unemployed -- I don\'t know that one number in and of itself can tell the story of economic devastation that we\'ve seen and the concern that the President has for getting the economy back on track and creating jobs.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t the higher figure more accurate because if you\'re out of work and the only thing you can find is 20 hours a week at Starbucks or whatever, that\'s not exactly a full-time job.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\'t people like that counted in --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s a part-time job.\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- it\'s not for me to say or to judge the efficacy of each -- or what each figure delineates.\xc2\xa0 The President will be concerned about joblessness for as long as there are people that want to work and can\'t find it.\xc2\xa0 Whether that number is an unemployment rate, whether that\'s the number of people that can only find that 20-hour job at Starbucks and wish they could find a 40-hour-a-week job, the President will continue to be concerned about job loss.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to take one more whack at this New York Times article about the behind-the-scenes deal with pharmaceutical companies.\xc2\xa0 What measures is the White House willing to take to ensure that this agreement remains in place and that no extra cost-saving measures are put in place by the House?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House willing to do anything?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys going to set a line in the sand?\xc2\xa0 Can you move beyond this agreement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve not laid down any sand and I\'ve not drawn in it.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has discussed throughout his time as a candidate and as President the importance of and ways that we need to cut costs for seniors.\xc2\xa0 PhRMA, the Senate Finance Committee, supported by the White House, entered into an agreement that would cut the costs for seniors who -- millions of whom fall into the doughnut hole as part of Medicare Part D\'s benefit that was signed into law a few years ago.\xc2\xa0 This will help fill that doughnut hole for millions of seniors, and some of that money will be used for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the goal of that agreement and that\'s the goal of our White House.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If they extract money from pharmaceutical companies beyond that, is that something that the White House would --</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we feel comfortable with the amount of money that has been talked about at this point.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, there is some unhappiness on the Hill among Democrats at the pace at which Senator Baucus is moving and sort of the way he is moving.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that impatience?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Can you be specific?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that somehow in the end the Republicans are not going to be there and that he is being strung along by them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the sense.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the President\'s main goal is to do all that we can to move forward, again, with that goal of getting something done for families, small businesses, and for people throughout this country this year.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe the President thinks that -- I know the President doesn\'t believe that he thinks this is -- that not meeting this August goal for the Finance Committee imperils in any way health care reform.\xc2\xa0 It gives us all a chance to continue working toward progress, and change isn\'t going to happen overnight, and we certainly understand that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything about the plans for the swearing-in of Judge Sotomayor?</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I promised to check on some of what might happen here as a result of that.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll look at that and try to have something in the week ahead tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I would also encourage you to contact directly the Supreme Court and they may have a better sense of when she would be sworn in.</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.<br/> <br/>  END<br/>  1:30 P.M.
