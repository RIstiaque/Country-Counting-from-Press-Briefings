EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, welcome to the sort of final leg of this journey.\xc2\xa0 I know you have all the fact sheets and stuff on the President\xe2\x80\x99s college affordability proposals that he talked in front of a very enthusiastic University of Michigan crowd this morning, marking the end of a -- what he feels was an excellent trip around the country talking about the proposals he put forward in his State of the Union Tuesday night.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, a number of economists are saying that beneath today\xe2\x80\x99s GDP numbers, it shows that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hit 2 percent of the first quarter of this year, and some are calling -- saying it shows we\xe2\x80\x99re still in a danger zone.\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re still in a danger zone?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to use that language, but I would say simply that this President has made clear, at least since he introduced the American Jobs Act, that while our economy has been recovering and our economy has created over 3 million private sector jobs in the last 22 months, we need to do everything we can to boost growth and boost job creation.\xc2\xa0 The recovery, as the President has said, remains fragile.\xc2\xa0 And we -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to pass the elements of the American Jobs Act that have not yet been passed, and that begins with Congress passing, without drama, without political theater and sideshows, debates about extraneous issues, the full extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to Democrats going to be today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To work with him and with their colleagues in Congress to pass important initiatives to get the economy moving, growing jobs.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly talk about some of the other initiatives in the State of the Union address -- the push to boost American manufacturing, to boost the trend towards insourcing, the need to develop American skills so that we have the workforce necessary for the jobs of the 21st century economy, the need to make college affordable for as many Americans as possible, which he discussed today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo his State of the Union agenda will pretty much be the focus.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Democrats sometimes get upset when he refers to the obstructionist Congress, and they feel that he\xe2\x80\x99s lumping them in with Republicans, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make a distinction --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that kind of concern expressed by Democrats in any -- in recent memory.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear, because the facts are incontestable, that the unfortunate obstructionism the country has encountered in passing common-sense, mainstream measures to get the economy going, in passing a balanced approach to deficit reduction and long-term control of our debt, have been Republicans exclusively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo let me be clear:\xc2\xa0 The obstacles that we face, the obstructionism we face in Congress have been thrown up by Republicans, unfortunately, and House Republicans in particular.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we saw at the very end of December with the back-and-forth over extending the payroll tax cut for two months.\xc2\xa0 What happened then has been the case on too many occasions, where a section of the House Republican caucus has been causing a lot of problems when it comes to getting common-sense, mainstream measures passed that could help the economy and boost job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, when the President was announcing his clean energy initiatives, there was a Las Vegas manufacturer of solar panels that had received stimulus funds that announced that 200 people working for it are going to be laid off.\xc2\xa0 Does that undercut his message?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the economy remains -- or the recovery, rather, remains fragile, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of this particular company, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure -- I know, of course, that when you do a report on that story or when you have done a report, you will note the 3.2 million private sector jobs that have been created in the last 22 months overall in the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThere are obviously -- even as overall payroll -- the workforce has expanded and unemployment has been gradually ticking down, some companies contract as others expand.\xc2\xa0 We need to do everything we can to continue to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 We need to pass the American Jobs Act, the portions that haven\xe2\x80\x99t passed yet.\xc2\xa0 We need to -- Congress needs to act on the measures that require congressional action in the State of the Union address and the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, so that we can build on the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made already towards digging ourselves out of this terrible recession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Other than the payroll tax cut, which I guess is at the top of the agenda, how does the President prioritize the various legislative initiatives that he\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about?\xc2\xa0 I mean, where does he put manufacturing?\xc2\xa0 Where does he put the tuition assistance in controlling costs?\xc2\xa0 What does he want done first by Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, payroll tax cut, as you know, extension is the pressing matter because of the deadline that is approaching, again, on that issue.\xc2\xa0 As I made clear and he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear, the overarching priority that he has are the things that he can do with Congress and through his own executive authority to grow the economy and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the broader impact of making college more affordable is building a foundation for long-term economic growth to ensure that we have a workforce that\xe2\x80\x99s educated, prepared for the jobs of the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s more of a long-term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s not an immediate priority?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you want to rank things.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are all -- the things that he discussed in these past three days are his absolute top priorities.\xc2\xa0 But the thing that he focuses on more than any other every day is economic growth and job creation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This -- I know this trip is official business, but this last rally felt kind of campaign-y, with a big cheering crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cfour more years.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He was certainly in the mode where he was making his case in a very passionate way.\xc2\xa0 What would you say to people who would look at that and say that this looked like a campaign rally?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, obviously the President appreciates the enthusiasm of the crowd, but the President came and spoke about policy initiatives.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t deliver a campaign speech.\xc2\xa0 Throughout this three-day trip and five-state trip, he\'s been discussing the substantive and sometimes quite detailed policy proposals that he put forward in the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we\'re not going to tell people not to applaud or be happy to see him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President watches this bruising Republican primary contest that\xe2\x80\x99s going on, has he expressed any concern that he might be stepping into a general election that will be equally as rough-and-tumble?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t to me.\xc2\xa0 As you know, because you\'ve heard him say so, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really watch the Republican primary.\xc2\xa0 He reads about it, he just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- you haven\'t asked me yet if he watched the debate last night, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Not because, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s just he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch a lot of TV.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t watched a lot of the debates?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t watched any of them.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch a lot of TV, except for sports.\xc2\xa0 But he certainly reads about and keeps up with what\'s going on.\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t expressed that concern, no.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Newt Gingrich, does he have any preference?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the President has had his own experience with tough campaigns, certainly in 2008, the primary campaign in particular.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that campaign, what was notable about it was it really was -- both that and the general election were focused primarily on the issues.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to having a debate about the issues in the general election when the time comes.\xc2\xa0 Right now he\'s going to focus on doing the things he needs to do for the country as President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President, during this trip, has also been talking to Spanish-language media about immigration, for instance.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday in the debate, there was a big brouhaha between Gingrich and Romney on that issue.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that any of the Republican candidates is anti-immigrant, as Gingrich has characterized Romney?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He\'s also committed to enforcing our laws and dealing with illegal immigration, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say.\xc2\xa0 Under his presidency, there are more boots on the ground on the border than before and fewer illegal crossings.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tI think a distinction that he has made and you in the media have made has to do in particular with the DREAM Act, which both leading candidates in the Republican primaries have said they would veto.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly disagrees with that position, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him say so in interviews with not just Latino media but general press conferences and others.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a very stark difference, as is the fact that setting aside the presidential race, but the comprehensive immigration reform used to have the support of some extremely high-profile Republicans, elected officials, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor George W. Bush, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponent in general election 2008, John McCain, senator from Arizona -- including a number of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt requires that kind of bipartisan support to get it done.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly hopes that Republicans in Congress will once again acknowledge that we need a comprehensive approach to immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President has demonstrated through his actions his commitment to enforcing the law, to putting boots on the ground on the border.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would he describe him as anti-immigrant, though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to wade into the Republican primary.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a week ahead?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I should have said at the beginning that we do not yet have a week ahead, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it to you.\xc2\xa0 It will be a great week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be a week ahead?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the fundraising event tonight?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to check.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see that in my schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re probably not going to know the answer to this, but is the President planning any purely campaign swings in the next -- at anytime\xc2\xa0 soon, just like -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you would define it, but is that on the horizon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel to announce, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any upcoming travel like that.\xc2\xa0 But that -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when our next trip is, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not much help to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just describe his mood at all at the end of this -- at the end of this trip after the State of the Union?\xc2\xa0 With some good news, again, polling news from this week, just how he\xe2\x80\x99s feeling about his standing right now politically in the campaign.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer questions about charges and stuff because I speak for him and defend him, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly in a very good mood, and those of you who have seen him up close I think can confirm that.\xc2\xa0 He always enjoys getting out in the country.\xc2\xa0 And this was I think a particularly rewarding trip because he was able to go a lot of different places, a lot of different audiences, speak about very substantive issues that matter to Americans on the ground in Colorado, Arizona, Michigan, Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Where else did we go?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arizona.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Arizona.\xc2\xa0 Did I say that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he talking about Arizona?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I love Arizona, and so does the President.\xc2\xa0 I think I said Nevada, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, five states.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s in a very good mood.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the State of the Union address seems to have been very well received, both it was well received in the hall and it was well received broadly across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the initiatives that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward seem to have a great deal of support, which he thinks is a good thing, because they\xe2\x80\x99re important to growing our economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re President, that makes for a good week.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the super performance of our special forces on Tuesday night added to the week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a week ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 12:27 P.M.
