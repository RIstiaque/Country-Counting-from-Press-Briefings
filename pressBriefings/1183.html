CST\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll just have another gaggle, this one in order to read out some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities during this flight between Santiago, Chile and El Salvador -- San Salvador.\xc2\xa0 So I have with me once again, back by popular demand, Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just refer to three calls the President made.\xc2\xa0 Earlier this afternoon -- or this morning I guess, he had a call with his national security team, secure call with Tom Donilon and Bill Daley on here, as well as Hilary Clinton, Bob Gates, the Vice President, Tony Blinken, Denis McDonough, Admiral Mullen and General Ham, to, again, get the update on the latest military activity taking place in Libya, an assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s taking place on the ground in Libya, and a review of our diplomatic efforts associated with the coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then he had two additional calls.\xc2\xa0 He called President Sarkozy of France and Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom.\xc2\xa0 They reviewed the substantial progress that\'s been made in terms of halting the advance of Qaddafi forces on Benghazi, as well as the establishment of a no-fly zone through the targeting of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s air defenses and air assets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They also noted the continued effort that\'s going to need to be done to achieve the goals that are specified in U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973.\xc2\xa0 The leaders also agreed that NATO should play a key role in the command structure going forward for the enforcement of the no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 And again, those discussions are ongoing in Brussels and in capitals, but of course, in their calls the President -- with President Sarkozy and Prime Minister Cameron, there was agreement that NATO does have a key role to play in this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So those are the three calls the President made -- the first was his national team, the second was with President Sarkozy, the third was with Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 They also of course, -- the leaders agreed to stay in close consultation on this going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then, as you know, just to reiterate, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been a slight change today.\xc2\xa0 We are going to have the bilateral meeting with President Funes and then there will be a press conference, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to ask questions of the President. I think that\'s a two and two -- so I think that\'s a two-plus-two press conference.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then the President is doing interviews with CNN Espanol and Univision.\xc2\xa0 Then I think we are going to visit the Tomb of Father Romero later this afternoon and then have the official dinner tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why the change?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The President is going with President Funes today and we just decided to do it this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll still be here tonight, of course, in San Salvador.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\'ll leave earlier tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if it affects the timing of our departure tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the Mayan visit still on tomorrow, the Mayan ruins visit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check that for you and let you know.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve had no updates on tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We just decided to go forward with the visit to the Romero Tomb today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you expand a bit on NATO -- you say NATO has a key role to play in this effort.\xc2\xa0 Can you expand a little bit more on that?\xc2\xa0 Does that need to be command and control, or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement that NATO has certain capabilities that are very important in terms of facilitating command and control and that -- however there is a coalition, of course, that is broader than NATO, so this is not simply a NATO operation.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the agreement is that there are specific capabilities within NATO that would be important for the command and control of the -- to support the command and control of a no-fly zone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any examples of what those specific capabilities are -- something that would sort of better explain that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, the ability to coordinate -- I mean, NATO is essentially set up to coordinate the activities of many different military forces.\xc2\xa0 So while I\xe2\x80\x99m not a military expert, I think the ability to coordinate different roles and responsibilities of partners in a military operation like this is something that exists within NATO.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a situation going forward where different nations are going to make different contributions, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s related to flying planes, providing other types of support, logistics, intelligence, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s important you have a command structure that can support different types of contributions of different nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, has there been consultation with other partners, non-NATO partners?\xc2\xa0 Are they okay with NATO having command and control?\xc2\xa0 And what role would they play in that structure?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- what we are saying right now is that NATO will have a key role to play here.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there will be a broader structure, if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to encompass non-NATO countries as well.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important distinction that there are capabilities within NATO that can support a command structure, but there is a broader coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is not finalized so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to suggest that it is.\xc2\xa0 This is still being worked in Brussels.\xc2\xa0 The command structure is not yet finalized, but I think what everybody does agree is that there is a key role that NATO can play.\xc2\xa0 Again, just this morning, the President spoke, as you know, to the Emir of Qatar, who has offered to contribute and of course we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to the effort to have that kind of Arab participation, which obviously goes beyond NATO as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is figuring out what the different contributions are going to be of different nations and then what the structure is going to be in place that can facilitate those contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President pleased with how those conversations are going?\xc2\xa0 And based on sort of on the calls that he had today, can you give us a sense of the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made over the last 24 hours and the days and weeks question, sort of where are we there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think there is a -- he was very pleased with the calls.\xc2\xa0 I think there was a very strong agreement among the three leaders about the state of play right now, about the focused nature of the effort, and about what was going to be required as we complete a first phase of this effort and look towards a second one.\xc2\xa0 So I think they were very positive conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDid you have another --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a sense of the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made over the last 24 hours.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we continue to feel -- see that there are not Libyan -- Qaddafi is not flying -- is not capable of flying.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been no indication that he\xe2\x80\x99s had planes in the air or done anything in the air.\xc2\xa0 So you have in essence the beginnings of a no-fly zone in the sense that we\xe2\x80\x99ve removed that capability from him to date, although we still believe that there are more targets, I think -- and the Pentagon will have this -- but associated with the establishment of the no-fly zone.</p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, I think what we saw today, as I referenced yesterday in my briefing, the vast majority of the flights associated with the enforcement of the beginnings of this no-fly zone are already allied flights, which is important.\xc2\xa0 The United States, of course, continues to bring our capabilities to bear as well, but we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing very robust allied participation, which is good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we see -- we do believe that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces pull back from Benghazi, which is very important given that that was the largest population center that was under imminent danger.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, Libyan civilians continue to be threatened in a number of places -- Misurata among them, for instance.\xc2\xa0 So we continue to watch the humanitarian situation very closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, what is the opposition doing?\xc2\xa0 Are they holding in place, as far as you know, or are they advancing against the Qaddafi regime?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is the opposition is pleased that the threat that they faced in Benghazi is certainly -- has been pulled back in terms of the advances that Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces were making, so that there\xe2\x80\x99s more space for people to be freed from fear in the Benghazi area and for the opposition to operate freely in terms of their own consultations.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of what their next steps are, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to say.\xc2\xa0 We were not -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not in that kind of coordination with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, could you tell us -- could you say something about what they -- where the Arab League and Turkey, in particular, are on the current plans for NATO?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think -- and I want to be very clear on this, that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about NATO in a broader context.\xc2\xa0 So this is not simply a NATO thing; this is what capabilities can NATO contribute in the context of an international coalition that extends beyond NATO.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turkey, of course, is an important NATO ally.\xc2\xa0 And I think Prime Minister Erdogan and the President had a good discussion last night where they agreed about the aims of the resolution.\xc2\xa0 And Turkey is a part of the discussions we\xe2\x80\x99re having about how this is going to be structured going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with regard to the Arab League, we saw a reiteration of the political support for the effort from Amr Moussa yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President had a good conversation with the Emir of Qatar this morning.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very that we continue to underscore that the coalition includes, but goes beyond us and our European allies, to include, for instance, all those nations who expressed strong political support in Paris, as well as nations like Qatar that have signaled that they\xe2\x80\x99ll make important contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s still needed to resolve the command and control issue that would lead to the transition?\xc2\xa0 And after you have that transition, how does that change the U.S. participation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that this is just a matter of continuing to make sure that we have the best structure in place. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of just military planning and diplomatic consultation in different capitals with different partners -- some of that in NATO and some of that, again, with other partners.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the U.S. contribution, as the President has said, we are bringing a set of unique capabilities to bear in this first phase, the front end of this operation, which has helped stop the advances of Qaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s forces and helped establish and shape a no-fly zone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we move to a separate phase, our allies and partners will be in the lead in terms of enforcing a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 We have capabilities that we can use to support that effort, but in terms of the enforcement of the no-fly zone, we expect our allies and partners to be in the lead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask if the President plans to make a specific speech or perhaps an address of some kind to further explain the rationale for the involvement?\xc2\xa0 There have been critics who say that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been sufficiently -- I know he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about it a lot, but has he planned something else?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d make a few points.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President spoke in some detail about Libya on Friday.\xc2\xa0 He made a statement again on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 He addressed it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I imagine he\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of opportunity to address it today at the press conference.\xc2\xa0 So he also provides in the letter to Congress a fairly detailed explanation of precisely what the mission is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Security Council resolution has a detailed description of what the nature of the mission is.\xc2\xa0 So in the first instance, I just think there has been a consistent communication about precisely what our efforts are going to be in Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That said, I am sure the President will continue to want to communicate to the American people and the international community what our goals are, particularly as we move through each stage of this.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d, of course, anticipate the President continuing to speak to this in the coming days.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, we should probably get ready to land.\xc2\xa0 I heard the gear drop.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are both pilots now safe?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon probably did a briefing while we were in the air, but they\'re both safe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick question on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yesterday apparently spoke to the President according to local reports to make a personal appeal for help with the investigation into his father\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us anything on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I can check on it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s first I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with Restrepo.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we gather from the change of touring today that tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is going to change or be --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, in the sense that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the visit to the tomb today, that\'s obviously happening today and not tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates beyond that for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll get them to you when we have them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know how the TV interviews will be made available, by any chance?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll check when we get on the ground -- that we don\'t make them available.\xc2\xa0 CNN Espanol is likely to air it fairly soon after it is given.\xc2\xa0 And that may be also true for Univision, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get further update on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
