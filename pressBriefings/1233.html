EST</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where\xe2\x80\x99s the cake?<br/><br/>\n\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a standing-room crowd here.<br/><br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I noticed such a thing, and many cameras, and I see a number of Christmas ties as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fire away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a bit more -- in a bit more detail about what you\'re going to be doing next?\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to be lobbying or consulting.\xc2\xa0 How would you define your next job?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start by saying a few things, Ben. It is -- and you all know this because you do this as well, and that is it is an honor and a privilege to stand here, to work inside this building, to serve your country, to work for a President that I admire as much as President Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been a member of his staff for almost seven years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable privilege.\xc2\xa0 It is in many ways the opportunity of a lifetime, one that I will be forever thankful and grateful for. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\'m going to do next is step back a little bit, recharge some.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been going at this pace for at least four years.\xc2\xa0 I will have an opportunity I hope to give some speeches. I will continue to provide advice and counsel to this building and to this President.\xc2\xa0 And I look forward to continuing to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of advocacy for the President, are you looking forward to the potential freedom that will come with speaking for him and not being behind that podium?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, we -- we\'re in a very different political environment than we\'ve been in a number of years in this country and I think whoever stands here or whoever goes on television to make the case for this administration should be an advocate of the decisions and the policies that are coming from this building.\xc2\xa0 You certainly have to play that role.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going in order to be freed up to say a series of things that I might not otherwise say.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve enjoyed every time I\'ve come out here and even on days when you -- even every day, even when you wake up at 4:00 a.m. and pick up the paper and groan that you have a sense of what the first several questions might be.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for this country and for an administration to come out here and advocate on behalf of and -- on behalf of its policies and answer your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how long you\xe2\x80\x99ve been next to now President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the impact that you think your leaving will have in concert with David Axelrod and already Rahm Emanuel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 One of the things you learn very quickly as you walk into this building each day, you\xe2\x80\x99re struck by the sense that -- of the history of this place, and you realize that whatever your length of service here, it is temporary in the long and wonderful history of our country.\xc2\xa0 And I think it does an administration good -- and I think it will do this administration good -- to have people like David Plouffe and others come into an administration who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here, who have been able to watch a little bit from the outside.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We all admit there\xe2\x80\x99s -- you have to admit there\xe2\x80\x99s a bubble in here, to some degree.\xc2\xa0 So I think having new voices and having fresh voices, some of those voices that are coming back from having taken a couple of years off, are an important part of this process.\xc2\xa0 I think they will serve the President well, even as people like David Axelrod and I go outside of the building and have a chance to talk to the President and people here with a slightly different perspective of not driving in here each morning.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unique.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- but the truth is you walk around here and you see the history and such, and I\'d just reiterate again, you realize that for however long you\xe2\x80\x99re here, it\xe2\x80\x99s temporary.\xc2\xa0 But what endures is our government.\xc2\xa0 What endures is the great experiment of democracy that\xe2\x80\x99s proved to be such a wonderful thing for the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up, Robert.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me go around.\xc2\xa0 I have a feeling we\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for a little bit today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ve got a couple questions, one domestic and one international.\xc2\xa0 The incoming Republican budget chief of the House, Paul Ryan, is saying that he will demand spending concessions from the administration in exchange for an agreement -- a willingness to lift the national debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Would the administration be willing to consider such --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Matt, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have a discussion -- we are going to have a discussion about steps that are going to be taken to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 We made some extraordinary decisions over the past several years, some in this administration, some in the previous administration, to deal with the financial calamity, to deal with the tremendous downturn in our economy and the job loss that it\xe2\x80\x99s wrought.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we are not here -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand we\xe2\x80\x99re not here because of a series of decisions that just got made in the last six months.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a series of decisions that date back quite a long time, that the bills have continually come due for and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to address them.<br/>\n\tWhat the exact specifics of those look like, obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go through. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I hope that everybody approaches not just the exercise of fiscal responsibility and fiscal restraint seriously, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, as you heard Chairman Goolsbee say this weekend, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to approach the upcoming vote, as you mentioned, on the debt limit, in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible and in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t threaten the full faith and credit of our government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President obviously has President Hu\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming visit on his mind.\xc2\xa0 He stopped in at a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister at the White House yesterday. How hard is the President willing to push President Hu on China\xe2\x80\x99s currency issue and on human rights when they meet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think those two issues that you mentioned will be on the agenda and will be tremendously important.\xc2\xa0 Those are issues that came up yesterday in the meeting, as you said, that the President stopped by.\xc2\xa0 China plays an enormously important role in our global economy and China has to take steps to rebalance its currency, and the President will continue to make that point when President Hu is here, as he did with the Foreign Minister.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would say this.\xc2\xa0 I would say that -- understand that human rights, the global economy, and currency are certainly on the list.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t go through all the topics, but of course the situation in North Korea I anticipate will also take up some amount of that time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President has been accused of soft-pedaling human rights when it comes to China.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be maintaining that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- he has -- I think if you speak directly to the President of China about your concerns about their record on human rights, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s soft-pedaling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You referenced Austan Goolsbee\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the debt ceiling and I wanted to read you this quote from a senator. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re here today to debate raising America\xe2\x80\x99s debt is a sign of leadership failure.\xc2\xa0 Leadership means the buck stops here.\xc2\xa0 Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren.\xc2\xa0 America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership.\xc2\xa0 Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America\xe2\x80\x99s debt limit.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I suspect you know who I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Joe Biden? (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I know, Barack Obama in 2006.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is Senator Barack Obama in 2006 voting against raising the debt ceiling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think what is important is -- understand that raising the debt limit was not in question in the outcome --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It passed 52 to 48.\xc2\xa0 It was close.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- in the outcome of that vote.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a close vote -- 52 to 48.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had closer.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the outcome -- based on the outcome of that vote, as I mentioned, the full faith and credit was not in doubt -- the full faith and credit of our government and our economy was not in doubt. And the President used it to make a point about needing to get serious about fiscal discipline. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we, as I said earlier, are dealing with the legacy of decisions that have been made over the past many years -- not paying for a prescription drug benefit, not paying for wars, not paying for tax cuts -- that changed our fiscal situation much more markedly than anything ever had.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it is up to -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress, because we know not to play politics with this, not to play games, to find a way to raise that debt limit, understanding that we have to -- as I mentioned to Matt, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to take some serious steps to get our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0 But we understand, we know what happens, we know the catastrophic actions with things like Social Security and Medicare if you threaten the solvency of the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what he was doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he only voted that way because he knew that it was going to pass?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think, clearly, he was sending a message.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he knew it was going to pass -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why he voted against it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, his vote was not necessarily needed on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I guess, then, just extending that, it would be okay for other senators to do the same thing this year, as long as they know that ultimately --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There may be some that send a message.\xc2\xa0 But I think what is important is that the ultimate bottom line is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t upset the notion of that full faith and credit.\xc2\xa0 We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, as some have rhetorically done leading up to this, suggest that that\xe2\x80\x99s a good way to deal with this, is simply to let -- to not pass that extension.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We understand, as Austan said -- and, look, Austan is a very bright economist.\xc2\xa0 The effects of something like that, as he said last weekend, would exceed anything that we saw in the financial collapse in 2008.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a quick question about the assassination of the governor of Punjab in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could put the assassination on the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s AfPak review, whether you think it indicates anything about how successful efforts are to root out extremism.\xc2\xa0 The governor was regarded as the best spokesman against extremism since Benazir Bhutto -- if you could just comment on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- first of all, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we -- that our government express our condolences. As you mentioned, this is an individual who had worked hard to promote tolerance, and his loss is a great one for Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton met with the Pakistani ambassador yesterday to personally pass along the President\xe2\x80\x99s condolences.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would simply say, Jake, that we remain committed to the efforts that the Pakistani government is and must undertake to root out violent extremism and to bring greater peace and stability to that country and to that region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, are you going to be endorsing a successor in your job?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you going to give the President any advice and counsel on who you think would be --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I generally don\xe2\x80\x99t speak publicly about the advice and the counsel that I give and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change that today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where do you think he is on the chief of staff situation?\xc2\xa0 Is he leading in any direction in terms of -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been made clear by various Democrats that if Pete Rouse wants to stay, he can.\xc2\xa0 Do you know where the President is, where Pete Rouse is? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot new for you than what I think was quoted as saying a couple of days ago. I expect that a lot of personnel decisions will get wrapped up in the next few days because the President and team understand how much work there is to be done this year, that our plate is full, and that we have many important issues that we have to address. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I will say, I expect that the President is likely to make some economic team personnel announcements on Friday.\xc2\xa0 I will not get into who that might be, but I think on Friday we will travel in the area, visit a window manufacturer that is -- that will take advantage of some of the expensing provisions that the President proposed in the fall and were contained in the ultimate tax agreement -- 100 percent expensing for the next year of investments that are made -- that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take advantage of that.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll draw some attention to that, as well as react to whatever the jobs numbers are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he doing the NEC announcement at the window manufacturer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Friday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Friday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Gene Sperling shopping for new windows right now?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A real quick question on the Medicare regulation that administration officials this morning are saying the New York Times report is true that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take out the references to end-of-life planning that would have been covered in the health care reform law.\xc2\xa0 My question is, it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re dropping it in part because, dating back to August of 2009, there have been these false allegations that they were going to be death panels.\xc2\xa0 And so why -- it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re giving those allegations credibility --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- by backpedaling now.\xc2\xa0 Why not fight for this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the administration believed was important was -- and, look, end-of-life counseling is something that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is a partisan issue.\xc2\xa0 I think people understand -- and we have had great national debates about these topics in the past few years -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of your relationship with your doctor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The proposed rule did not have these provisions in there originally.\xc2\xa0 We did not think it made sense, based on that, to necessarily include them in the final rule without having some discussion about that.\xc2\xa0 And so those come out of this rule, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change I think bipartisan support for having an intelligent conversation with a medical professional about your choices for end of life.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t this one of the things that upsets liberals in the President\xe2\x80\x99s own party that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fight for these things sometimes, you give in on it and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, Ed, we just -- we did not think that the process in the rulemaking was what we wanted it to be in terms of having and giving the public an adequate space in a public comment period to debate these kind of things.\xc2\xa0 That does not change, again, our support and others\xe2\x80\x99 support for these types of confidential discussions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, could you talk a little bit about your personal things that went into your making this decision?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you can make a ton of money giving speeches and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on a government salary for a long time.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also the issue of personal freedom; maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re exhausted by this job and maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re just sick and tired of us.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us a little bit of what went into this decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maybe?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Look, guys, I am not good at talking about myself.\xc2\xa0 Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s not a great trait to have if you live in Washington. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But, look, obviously this was not an easy decision.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very natural time period to make the decision to recharge a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I think a bunch of you guys in here covered the campaign that went for a couple years, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a couple of probably the busiest years that Washington and a White House have seen in many decades.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- look, you guys know this because -- again, because you guys cover this place, that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop.\xc2\xa0 Only rarely does it observe holidays like Christmas, and sometimes not even that.\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt there is a -- this is a tough place to work.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, again, it is an amazing privilege.\xc2\xa0 I would not trade\xc2\xa0 -- as I told my staff this morning -- I would not trade the worst day I\xe2\x80\x99ve had here for many of the best days that you might have in another job.\xc2\xa0 I think the last two years have been extraordinary to watch, extraordinary to be a part of. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI work with a President that I love and respect.\xc2\xa0 I work with a group of people who comprise my staff and comprise the White House staff that I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with almost nonstop, many of them, for four years.\xc2\xa0 Some -- Tommy Vietor came here -- came to the Obama campaign for Senate a couple months after I did, well before anybody had given any DNC speeches and we were just running for the Senate in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 So those are -- I don\'t consider the people that I work for just colleagues; I consider them among the best friends that I have. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s time to take a little break.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time to -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a little boy who probably needs a ride to school every now and then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Vietor? (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I was talking about Nick -- because the surfboard doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit in my car, so -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a tan or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to say, that is -- that, my friends, is not a tan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s tan, but that is -- those are the results of something a little bit more embarrassing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did I just mention -- are we on TV?\xc2\xa0 Is this -- (laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure people will follow up on your situation.\xc2\xa0 But if I could shift to health care for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Obviously --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I would much rather talk about health care than myself.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you do.\xc2\xa0 Health care reform is going to be under assault, obviously, in the coming weeks and months.\xc2\xa0 How active is the President going to be in -- is he going to let this happen on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Or is he going to get out there -- are there any plans in the works for a major speech from the President defending health care reform?\xc2\xa0 And are you reluctant to turn it into a political football like it was a year ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, because I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important, Chip, is to understand that -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this acknowledged, I think, by many proponents of repeal -- that this is symbolic.\xc2\xa0 They understand that this is not going to land on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to pass the Senate, that this is a bit of huff and puff.\xc2\xa0 This town does that great --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they can cut off funding and have a significant effect on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And those are important, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, though, to take just a step back and understand beyond the symbolism what this means.\xc2\xa0 What this means is going back to a health care system where insurance companies are in charge and call the shots; where a child that is sick with a preexisting condition doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to get coverage in the greatest, strongest, most powerful country on the planet; where seniors don\'t get help with their prescription drug costs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President make a major speech making these arguments?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on it is fairly well known.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that -- I think as the debate continues and as the implementation continues -- which I think is the most important part of all this -- as the implementation continues, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President discuss this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not -- obviously the President is focused very much on the economy and on the job situation right now. He\xe2\x80\x99s remarkably proud of the accomplishment of health care.\xc2\xa0 We have now the tougher task of implementing and to ensure that what I talked about a second ago -- a family not having to worry about losing their insurance or having their insurance coverage capped by the decisions made by an insurance company; fear of skyrocketing premiums with no accountability; as I said, fear of discrimination on preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the American people want to go back to a health care system where those safety nets are in doubt, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the law is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to follow up on two subjects already covered and one new one.\xc2\xa0 On your end of your tenure as White House press secretary, President Obama has already said some kind things about what an effective advocate you were for his policies and administration.\xc2\xa0 How would you grade your own performance?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Since I still have many more briefings to do before the end of the month, I\'ll defer that question until the end of the class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You think you can pull it out still?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t do well talking about myself and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would there be anything you would wish that you had done differently?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think if you have any job and you say you don\xe2\x80\x99t wish you would have done something a little differently you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably not taken a good -- necessarily good look -- of course.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- there may be -- look, there may be something -- probably something every day.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I had -- I have the opportunity to work for and serve -- work for this President, serve this country, work with so many wonderful friends and be in the middle of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous -- it has been a tremendous honor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you would count yourself a success in what you did here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have been able to -- and, look, I play a very small role in a big -- a very big operation. So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand.\xc2\xa0 I think if you just look at what the President was able, and the Vice President were able to get accomplished at the end of last year -- a START treaty that will make real, discernible reductions in our deployed nuclear weapons; repealing a law that he believed and had believed for many years was unjust in repealing \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d; ensuring our economic recovery by making sure that tax rates for middle-class families didn\xe2\x80\x99t go up -- all of those are important things and might in a slow year count for -- or a slow two years, count for the entirety of what you were able to do.\xc2\xa0 That was just two weeks here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other things real quick.\xc2\xa0 On the Medicare rule, your explanation that the rule was revoked because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet your preferred standards for the rulemaking process leaves open the possibility that you would seek to reintroduce it in a way that does comport with your preferences for the rulemaking process. Is it dead for good?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would on the specifics for that point you over to HHS.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, getting to the question of how you expect to work with the House GOP majority, Congressman Cummings appeared on one of the Sunday morning talk shows saying that he would be vigilant to look out for the GOP majority, particularly of his committee, conducting witch hunts with subpoenas and that sort of thing. Congressman Issa appeared on three Sunday morning shows.\xc2\xa0 He sent out a bunch of letters and made pretty plain his agenda as the chairman of that committee.\xc2\xa0 I wonder, in everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Darrell Issa so far, whether you think he is engaged in witch hunts or whether you think he is going to conduct that committee in a way that you think you can productively work with him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He and the Vice President I think had a productive meeting at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 I think what is important is to understand that everybody in government should -- and certainly everybody here does -- want oversight that ensures that the intent of the law or the intent of the policy is being effectively carried out without waste or fraud. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at something the size and the scope of the Economic Recovery Act, you get a sense of how -- the degree to which -- the degree of importance that we put on that here. At the same time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- people want good oversight, but, as you said, we don\'t -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said\xe2\x80\x9d -- as your question said, people are not interested in relitigating everything in the past.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got problems in the future that we need to focus on.\xc2\xa0 So I think that we are happy to be a part of responsible oversight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then what do you think about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from him so far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that Congress is not even an hour and a half old.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think we -- maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to wait for me to grade him like I did myself.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the question is there\xe2\x80\x99s a standard for responsible oversight that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exceed the type of partisan, ideological, political witch hunts that people like Congressman Issa have spoken out against in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Savannah.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is your last day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sometime toward the -- probably the beginning of February.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a final last day yet.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that your successor would be named before you go?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President is going to call John Boehner today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I neglected to say I believe the -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a tradition of hearing from the new Congress.\xc2\xa0 He will speak to Eric Cantor and Nancy Pelosi I think on a call that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to place to here about 3:30 p.m. this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I can check on whether he intends to speak with the new Speaker.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he has had an opportunity to speak with him many times since the election. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, again, I think what this administration hopes for is for the type of bipartisanship and the type of collegiality that was had during the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 There were -- we dealt with some tough issues.\xc2\xa0 We dealt with some stuff that had been on the books or on our plates for quite some time, but we were able to do that in a way that served the interests of the American people.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good path toward what this President would like to see -- our ability to work in a bipartisan manner to make progress and move this country forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the interest of collegiality, would the President invite him to play golf?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I could see that happening, yes.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- that might require the President to practice a bit before that.\xc2\xa0 I think the new Speaker is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re leaving, so you can say that the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t as good at golf.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I would say that if I had just signed up for eight more years, and that is I think the President would be probably the first to tell you that whenever -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s handicap is, but whenever you tell people what your handicap is, it sort of -- it indicates that you are -- you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough to know what that number is.\xc2\xa0 Having played on occasion with the President, neither of us have discussed our many handicaps in playing golf.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then real quickly, has the President spoken to Bill Daley this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate he\xe2\x80\x99ll speak to him today or meet with him this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is a Camp David retreat with the Republican leaders still being considered?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we continue to have interest in.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where that lies and I can check on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Laura, do you have --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the departures and replacements at the top of the West Wing, yours and others, a lot of the candidates who are being mentioned or who are certain to take those roles are sort of coming from within the White House or within the general Obama sphere.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- what are the advantages of that, and do you see disadvantages to that in terms of not having --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously some people will take on new roles that have been in here.\xc2\xa0 And look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- and I think you guys understand that some sense of continuity is always important.\xc2\xa0 Look, I look at somebody like a David Plouffe who, sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously quite well-known to the President, played a very important role in the President getting to the White House, but I think David will bring a perspective that is fresh because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been inside of here for two years.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of necessarily just seeing totally different people.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a perspective that you gain when you\xe2\x80\x99re not in here every day.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Plouffe have a start date?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe Plouffe will start next Monday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of your future, do you plan on -- are you open to working for people other than advising Barack Obama, advising other Democrats or other candidates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Political candidates?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have probably worked for my -- my current boss is probably my last political candidate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about in terms of corporate clients?\xc2\xa0 Do you imagine taking anything on other than paid speeches to earn money?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten that far.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into that while I had not made any intentions known about what my future held.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, do -- as an advisor to the President from the outside, would that be a paid position or would it be compensated in any way, or just --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten all through that. Sometimes the advice that several of us give the President here he might consider worth what he paid for.\xc2\xa0 So that might not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Worth the investment?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I was going to say that might -- we might not want to do that on necessarily a sliding scale.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll work through some of those issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is he your last political candidate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Seems like a pretty good one to stop on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve come out here, has it been a -- to the podium, has it been a help or a hindrance to be both a main advisor and the spokesman?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a help.\xc2\xa0 And I think to you it\xe2\x80\x99s been a help, because I think you want whoever is in this role, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re somebody -- look, I have a pretty unique relationship with him based on just how long I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here and the types of -- you spend two years on the road with somebody -- or almost two years on the road with somebody, you get to know them pretty well and you get to know how they think.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s helpful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, I have always -- the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve operated has been -- and when we first started here, there were people -- well, do you want to know this?\xc2\xa0 Do you want to see these memos?\xc2\xa0 Do you want -- look, I would rather know and have to be cautious than to go out here and say something that turned out to be false.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think you -- it ultimately -- I think once -- I think if something like that happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to do this job.\xc2\xa0 So and, look, other people may be different.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m answering from my perspective, and that is I would always rather know and understand what -- and, look, there have been times when I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into stuff, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d rather know than to land on the wrong side of what the truth is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Through the years there have been certain press secretaries who have been strictly mouthpieces, and others who have had the dual roles that you have.\xc2\xa0 Would you advise President Obama to make sure that your successor has the same access that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say -- again, I want to separate just slightly because I do think it is -- I do think I have, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here so long with him -- or have been with him so long, that there is a uniqueness to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think any press secretary has to have the ability -- and I don\'t think any press secretary would be hired in this building that didn\'t have the ability to go see the chief of staff, go the senior advisors, or go see the President or the Vice President when they needed to.\xc2\xa0 I have had that ability.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously most of the counterparts that have stood up here, I think most of them would tell you that unless you had that ability it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense for you to do that job.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody in this building would put any potential successor of mine in the position of not granting them the ability to know what those answers are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the times in which you know stuff that the President is going to make news on or you -- look, I read a certain amount and I\xe2\x80\x99m involved in meetings in the Situation Room that you just can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about.\xc2\xa0 You will have those opportunities.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be able to walk into his office and say, sir, I need to get your opinion on this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, might you write a book?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not in the near future, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that on Friday there will be economic personnel team announcements.\xc2\xa0 In addition to the NEC, what else could we expect that day?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 See, this is one of those occasions that I was just speaking of, Peter, where one might know and one might decide whether one wants to make -- let me do this.\xc2\xa0 Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think all of those final decisions have been made, let me address that possibly tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So the Recovery Board, could there be a new person for that or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that that is envisioned for Friday, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it will be economic team, plural?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Plural.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And is the President, as he finalizes these decisions and reshapes his economic team, is he looking for any changes in the direction of his economic policies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, we talked earlier about at each different phase of the recovery there are different aspects that have to be focused on.\xc2\xa0 Obviously fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility -- after some of the extraordinary steps that the White House has had to take on the road to that recovery -- after those, obviously getting our fiscal house in order is an important one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, I think that ensuring our competitiveness and making sure that we are, as an administration, investing in the investments that will create a workforce that is more educated, more competitive, and able to better compete in a global marketplace, those are the types of things that are tremendously important to this President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk if someone like Bill Daley were to join the administration, how they could be an effective advocate with the business community?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me, without using that hypothetical name -- look, I think that this President is -- I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken steps that were important to ensure financial stability and to ensure that business was on the best footing possible in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think the President would be the first to advocate for what he believes are some strong pro-business policies.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look -- to take a second and look at the auto sales numbers from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 For the first time -- they were checking for me -- in I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long, the Big Three increased their market share.\xc2\xa0 And you saw an investment in the auto companies that was made by this administration that restructured Chrysler and GM -- put them into bankruptcy, restructured them, took them out -- has led to I think what anybody would term as an unqualified success at this point. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A stronger economy has lifted auto sales.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the Big Three have added market share for the first time together in a long time.\xc2\xa0 And I think those are the type of pro-business policies that the President is proud of.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President will have an opportunity to continue to and enhance his outreach to CEOs and to business leaders throughout the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would it be helpful, though, to have someone of his stature be able to go out and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s always helpful to have more and more people who can do that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why was the decision made to announce your departure before a replacement was found?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of unusual. I mean --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that it was that unusual.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That makes the search more public and more kind of fishbowl-like than if you did it all at once.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As opposed to all of our un-fishbowl-like --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there are degrees of fishbowlism.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t see that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, my other question is a follow-up to Laura.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have some kind of a major role, outside role as a paid consultant to the campaign, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you rule out taking corporate clients for the duration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I did.\xc2\xa0 I just -- you got to understand I\xe2\x80\x99ve been -- this is an announcement that\'s only a few hours old, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t totally figured out all of what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do with the rest of my life. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right. No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about the rest of your life.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about for the duration that you\xe2\x80\x99re a paid consultant to the reelection campaign. Are you saying that you feel it would be okay to have corporate clients at the same time?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If that\'s something I decided to do, and I was comfortable with who those clients were, I don\'t think that necessarily -- again, I would not get into the hypothetical of that at this point because it\xe2\x80\x99s just not something that is at this point relevant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question on health care.\xc2\xa0 To the extent that the debate is going to be relitigated, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you feel that the White House has kind of a chance to make a more effective argument and maybe persuade more people than ended up being persuaded of the merits of this last year.\xc2\xa0 And you talk about the insurance reforms that are popular like children with preexisting conditions or the doughnut hole or caps and rescissions.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering is, is the White House ready to defend robustly the things that are most controversial about the plan -- the expense of universal coverage and the individual mandate?\xc2\xa0 You rarely talk about those two things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think that\'s necessarily the case since the individual mandate is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed in here recently because there are a myriad of court cases that have been brought around that.\xc2\xa0 Understand what -- we talked about fiscal responsibility a few minutes ago.\xc2\xa0 One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s unique about what we passed was we paid for what we passed.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s understand what that means for repeal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s -- it is interesting and unique to see when one pays attention to and when one ignores the Congressional Budget Office.\xc2\xa0 The Congressional Budget Office, which -- how much is this, what\xe2\x80\x99s the price tag on this, how\xe2\x80\x99s it being paid for were questions that we answered a lot of during the debate, and were asked a lot of us during the debate by those who opposed what we were trying to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Repealing health care reform adds $140 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to cut not just the $100 billion they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but now I assume they\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay for that, too.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count the trillion dollars over the 10 years after that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re happy to talk about the expense of this.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s also be clear in talking about the expense of what happens if you repeal it -- not just for families with children that are sick, not just for families that worry that their coverage might have been capped, or, God forbid, an insurance company is making your medical decisions, but also what it means for our deficit and our debt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just again about what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing in the future --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Have the Cowboys found a coach yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 Can we say that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a paid consultant to the campaign?\xc2\xa0 Is that definitely what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 At some point, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how, if at all, when in the future can we expect you to be on television or acting as a surrogate for --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, as we speak.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in that new capacity?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that yet.\xc2\xa0 Look, I assume that I will have an opportunity to continue being an advocate for the decisions that are being made or have been made in this White House.\xc2\xa0 And I am certainly happy to do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, once the decisions -- all the decisions on personnel are known, what --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There will be a test.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will it say about the difference between now and the beginning of the administration -- what the next two years will be like versus the first two years? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think we have always talked about the fact that the next two years were going to be different than the first two years.\xc2\xa0 We were able to pass health care reform and financial reform, things like the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d all of which now have to be implemented.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has always looked at the first two years as a period of legislation, and at least the next year is a period of implementation and a period of continued economic -- taking steps to continue that economic recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I think you -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit -- there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a different group of people occupying the same desks that we have now that will play in a probably slightly different environment based on what I think the focus of this building is likely to be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how does that translate into the skill sets he is looking for?\xc2\xa0 Is he just looking for individual people that fit in a particular round hole or square peg --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, this is probably a better discussion to have when we have sort of a larger tableau of what all of those announcements will be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- obviously within each different position there\xe2\x80\x99s a skill set that, given the agenda and the environment, that may be slightly different than what you\xe2\x80\x99ve had, again, in the past two years.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s -- we can do a little bit more of that as we get into this a little bit more.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There will be multiple announcements?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 None that I\'m aware.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chief of staff won\xe2\x80\x99t be before Friday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing new on chief of staff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sticking with the big picture, Robert, given the number of and importance of the jobs at stake, is this a major overhaul, a minor tweaking?\xc2\xa0 Is it a big change of direction?\xc2\xa0 Is it just some retooling of attitude?\xc2\xa0 Is it just shifting from legislating -- is it bigger than a breadbox or smaller than Yugoslavia? (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think there are -- I think in many ways this is a pretty major retooling.\xc2\xa0 But, again, this is -- part of this is based on the fact that there are a lot of us who just feel like we need a little bit of a break.\xc2\xa0 So some of that happens because -- just as a natural cycle of this.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I should have layered that into my answer on Jackie\xe2\x80\x99s question -- I think that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, there will also -- again, there are new environments and there\xe2\x80\x99s a new Congress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of things that one has to and should take into account when you\xe2\x80\x99re making a lot of these decisions.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President and the team here are doing that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than just new faces doing the same thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think so.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the truth is, I mean, I think -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily think of the fact that -- there may be functions in one area or domain or in the box of one personnel position that may get moved or shifted.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think anytime you have the natural change of a White House, it\xe2\x80\x99s not simply just, okay, what you did -- somebody else sits where you did and does everything that you did.\xc2\xa0 I think there will be some retooling of that as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a major retooling for what purpose, or to correct what deficiencies?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s -- major retooling for what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the reason I would consider it a major retooling is obviously a lot of people that have been here for a while and certainly since the inception of the administration that are leaving.\xc2\xa0 Again, as I\'ve said to you guys countless times, some people -- a lot of people leave because it\xe2\x80\x99s time to take a break, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to do something different, or it\xe2\x80\x99s time to -- look, some people here -- Dr. Summers is a good example, somebody who was going to serve for and told the President he would serve for two years.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people that have been like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those people can leave without a major retooling.\xc2\xa0 You just called it a major retooling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be careful then in what I said.\xc2\xa0 I said it was a major retooling because there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of new faces.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to follow on there, to what degree is it because he\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfied with the performance of people?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would suggest that almost all of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is -- not all of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, but a decent amount of what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the natural attrition of an administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about natural attrition and the exhaustion of people who have been doing this for essentially four years when you count the campaign, that goes for the President, as well.\xc2\xa0 How do you address his energy level?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Have we not told you about the replacement of -- (laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, a lead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s good. No, look -- I mean, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s one -- I mean, look, you sign up for and understand that you -- as a President you can\xe2\x80\x99t take a year off to recharge.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put people around him that have the fresh perspective, that have come into a different job or have come into the administration, after having not been here for a couple of years, and give this place the vitality that it will always have largely because it\xe2\x80\x99s the White House. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that -- and I think the President believes that\xe2\x80\x99s important, that there are a -- having additional voices, having different and fresh perspectives, having those come from, again, folks that haven\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily been inside this bubble for two years or four years or seven years, that that\xe2\x80\x99s really important to the process of running an administration, of running a White House, and of governing a country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Having been at this for two years, can you talk to us a bit about the value of the daily briefing?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to the general public?\xc2\xa0 Is it helpful to reporters?\xc2\xa0 Is it helpful to the White House?\xc2\xa0 Would you make any changes?\xc2\xa0 Would you take it off camera?\xc2\xa0 Do you like it being on camera?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve experimented with a couple different things like -- I do think there\xe2\x80\x99s a great utility in doing some off-camera gaggles.\xc2\xa0 We probably, truth be told, haven\xe2\x80\x99t done enough of those.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an ability to talk about things slightly differently without all these fancy lights. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, though, as I said -- I alluded to earlier, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to, as a government, to come out here and talk about and answer the -- talk about the policies and decisions that are being made and to answer the questions surrounding those.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like I said, there are days in which -- my guess is it will happen again this week -- where you pick up that newspaper or you turn on your computer at 4:30 a.m. in the morning while your coffee is still brewing and you groan and, oh, God, what -- you know, great, this is going -- and then you get on your BlackBerry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a usefulness to that.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that this has been an enduring quality.\xc2\xa0 I do think there is -- look, I think there has to be -- I think there should continue to be experimentation, again, with gaggles.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve tried more stuff on social networking that I think will continue long past my existence inside this building because that, too, is important. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou now have the ability to -- look, I got on something like Twitter largely from watching you guys tweet while the President was standing right here.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fascinating concept.\xc2\xa0 All this stuff moves much faster.\xc2\xa0 I think that will endure.\xc2\xa0 And I think the briefing will endure.\xc2\xa0 And I think what gets added to and what complements the briefing in terms of breaking down any walls that exist between the people and their government will only accelerate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the end-of-life counseling, could you say some more on the end-of-life counseling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me just go to Glenn and I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was going to ask exactly the same question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 To follow up on a couple of the other questions regarding the retooling, there was a lot of criticism, some that came from within the administration, sort of self-criticism about messaging in the last year, on communications.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re leaving.\xc2\xa0 David Axelrod is leaving.\xc2\xa0 You two are the principal architects of the communications and messaging strategy.\xc2\xa0 Should we read anything into that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99d be the first ones to tell you that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been perfect. It\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult environment, given where we are economically.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not to make any excuses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You people in here hear me joke I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to a policy problem meeting yet.\xc2\xa0 Every meeting I go to is the policy is fine, it\xe2\x80\x99s just we\xe2\x80\x99re not communicating well.\xc2\xa0 I get that that\'s sort of some of the way that you go through problems here.\xc2\xa0 But I think that there -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see continuity, obviously, in the message operation here.\xc2\xa0 That is important.\xc2\xa0 And again, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see people like David Plouffe, who will come in and be a fresh perspective. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think it would be fair to read into the fact that the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving is we haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt like we\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished anything.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you\xe2\x80\x99d likely be staying even if the midterms hadn\xe2\x80\x99t turned out to be so difficult --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t make a decision to step away and recharge because of the midterms.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a very natural time in the administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to get, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, some fresh voices, including somebody up here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks. You talked about how it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to be a new voice; that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be a fresh voice. And even if Bill Daley and Gene Sperling aren\xe2\x80\x99t the ones named to these new positions, they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously been given very serious consideration, are the frontrunners, or expected to be named. These are Clinton people -- originally.\xc2\xa0 Is that a coincidence?\xc2\xa0 Or is their service and what they represented and their experience back in the Clinton years something that you --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this because I don\'t want --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re trying --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as Jackie pointed out, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty good at not making the news today.\xc2\xa0 I will -- I don\'t want to get into -- again, I don\'t want my answer to be based on the names that you brought up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there are -- I guess part of the problem with this is there\xe2\x80\x99s not like one type of person, right?\xc2\xa0 You want people that -- there are people that are important to have in here that haven\xe2\x80\x99t served in government, and then there are other positions where previous service in government, be it for Clinton, be it for others, is important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have people here, obviously -- I go down to John Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s office; there\xe2\x80\x99s a picture of he and George H.W. Bush. So there are people that have been here through a bunch of different administrations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I think some of it -- I hate to talk about it writ large because sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\'t think the example necessarily carries as easily.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The economy was good during the Clinton years, though. I mean, is there -- does this administration believe that bringing -- that having some of those advisors who were responsible for bits of the economic --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Lew at OMB, whether it -- look, Dr. Summers who had been obviously here before, obviously Secretary Geithner served also in the Clinton administration and others who --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gene Sperling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And Gene, Jason Furman -- there\xe2\x80\x99s other folks that have important experience, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s good to have. They understand and have -- as I said, they have important experiences.\xc2\xa0 They have -- they understand what the job entails.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was some discussion about you staying on in the administration but not as press secretary, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why you decided not to go that route.\xc2\xa0 Was it a matter of just being too tired?\xc2\xa0 Was it a matter of not finding exactly the right portfolio or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I had some -- I think the best service that I can provide this President is for the next couple of years outside of this building.\xc2\xa0 And that coincides nicely with my wanting to get a little bit of a break.\xc2\xa0 And it all worked out that way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you see coming back to the White House if he wins a second term, or are you declaring your White House service done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t close the door.\xc2\xa0 I told the President I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to serve as ambassador to Italy in the second administration. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Begrudgingly I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, but -- okay, all right, you got me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But seriously, could you see coming back here in a second term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 One of my next tasks is going to be to make sure that he has the ability to make some of those decisions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back, hold on.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- can we come back to that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did the administration make of the unusually public way that the Israelis asked for the release of Jonathan Pollard yesterday?\xc2\xa0 And is this decision in any way likely to be taken in the context of wider peace moves in the region?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the -- obviously the State Department answered this a little bit yesterday in saying that they received the request; they\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at it.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to underscore that Mr. Pollard was convicted of some of the most serious crimes that anybody can be charged with.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your use of social media platforms like you used to call the Twitter and YouTube --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That was a joke, but, yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 The use of these kind of platforms, to what degree can you gauge its effectiveness in terms of sort of bypassing us, who are filters --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s I think a great misnomer, because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important -- social networking and the use of those type of tools I think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at it as, boy, I can now talk to people and you guys -- I\'m going to go around you.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve never said that.\xc2\xa0 Because, quite frankly, I subscribe to what you write; you guys subscribe to what I write.\xc2\xa0 And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s unique is we\xe2\x80\x99ve done recently -- and I\'ve greatly enjoyed them, though I realize that -- and I know you all agree -- that very few of my answers conform to 140 characters. But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that you can have a dialogue with people who are going about their daily lives, who have questions for the administration about what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing, and you guys have written off of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think people should look at the increased transparency in their government, a greater explanation of the decisions that we\xe2\x80\x99re making, as an effort to move around and go around you guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was your last vacation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Serious vacation?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent question.<br/>\n\tWhen was the last time I took a vacation and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take my BlackBerry?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been -- it has certainly exceeded -- it\xe2\x80\x99s probably been almost seven years.\xc2\xa0 I will -- that will be nice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you still going to be a two BlackBerry man when you leave here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hope not. I hope not. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou had an end-of-life question, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, end-of-life counseling, and if you could say a little more on that.\xc2\xa0 Was the President concerned that by issuing this 1233 in executive order that he might be portrayed as something of a -- like President Kevorkian or something, given the tremendous opposition to that particular aspect of the health care bill from the U.S. population? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, that obviously -- your characterization did not play a role in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s determination of that.\xc2\xa0 There is a -- I think if you look at polling, public polling, while there is concern from some about that provision, there is not -- at least, I have not seen something that would have people believe that a great majority of people believe in the concept of -- and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s widely been debunked -- this notion of a so-called \xe2\x80\x9cdeath panel.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But awarding doctors, giving them bonuses for having this kind of counseling, of course, would lead to more of it going on, pressuring a lot of people to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a mischaracterization.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty broad mischaracterization of what the rule would do.\xc2\xa0 This is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not an accurate characterization of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, guys.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, will you miss us?</p>\n<p>END<br/> 2:06 P.M.
