Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for clarifications, marked with asterisks.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:56 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Before we begin, let me observe that there are heavy hearts around the White House complex today as we mourn the loss of our former colleague and friend, Brandon Lepow. \xc2\xa0Brandon passed away last night, surrounded by friends and family, after a long and spirited fight against cancer. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBrandon worked on the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign in 2008, and continued here at the White House, first in the advance shop before moving over to our communications operation. \xc2\xa0So many of you also got to know him well.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re saddened by Brandon\xe2\x80\x99s death, but I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one who continues to be inspired by his life and the way that he lived it. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about Brandon\xe2\x80\x99s family, and particularly his parents as they mourn the loss of their son. \xc2\xa0But as a relatively new father myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been thinking about the kind of man that I want my son to grow up to be. \xc2\xa0And Brandon\xe2\x80\x99s courage in confronting tough challenges, his selflessness and humility in interacting both with those he loved and those he barely knew, and his passion for what he believed in makes him a genuine role model.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo to his wife, Theresa, who bravely and loyally walked every step of a difficult path with Brandon over the last few years, please know that there are a lot of people in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital and around the country who are sending a lot of love to you today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Brandon, buddy, we\xe2\x80\x99re really going to miss you, but we\xe2\x80\x99re sure going to do our best to live up to the high standard that you\xe2\x80\x99ve set.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, let\xe2\x80\x99s get down to business. \xc2\xa0And I promised last week, in the briefing, a brief presentation about the TPP. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in our conversations --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My lucky day.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My lucky day.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Your lucky day. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Fortunately, I have some visuals that might make this more entertaining than my usual beginning. \xc2\xa0So be patient with me.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are -- we know that when the rules of trade are fair, that Americans can out-compete anyone in the world. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the idea that\xe2\x80\x99s at the heart of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0And a new report that was recently released by the USTR details how the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement would slash 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, for example, let me start with Ohio. \xc2\xa0Ohio is a good example. \xc2\xa0Tires that are made in America, in Ohio, face foreign tariffs -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, they face tariffs or foreign taxes as high as 40 percent. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that, in the past, concerns have been raised about the impact that foreign countries like China have had on our factories and our workers when they dump tires into markets here in the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to strong trade enforcement, the United States has worked aggressively, through the WTO, to hold China accountable for violating trade rules. \xc2\xa0There are a number of occasions in which that\xe2\x80\x99s taken place. \xc2\xa0The Trans-Pacific Partnership actually goes one step further, by making sure that manufacturers aren\xe2\x80\x99t at a disadvantage when they sell their tires abroad to any of our 11 TPP countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Ohio is a good example. \xc2\xa0Foreign taxes on tires made in America and shipped from Ohio are as high as 40 percent. \xc2\xa0And under the TPP, those would be eliminated.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me give you the examples of some other states that may resonate. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s take Texas, for example. \xc2\xa0Leather boots that are shipped from Texas to TPP countries face foreign taxes as high as 30 percent, and obviously those would be taxes that would eliminated through the TPP. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust to choose another example, how about Kentucky. \xc2\xa0Kentucky is a state known for its bourbon. \xc2\xa0Some TPP countries place foreign taxes on bourbon as high as 45 percent. \xc2\xa0Those tariffs would be eliminated through the TPP. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s consider Michigan. \xc2\xa0Michigan obviously is well known for exporting cars around the world. \xc2\xa0These are American cars made by American workers. \xc2\xa0In some TPP countries, these automobiles face a foreign tax of up to 70 percent, a tax that would be eliminated through the TPP. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust to choose another state, how about Iowa. \xc2\xa0Iowa is a state that produces a significant quantity of pork that is shipped around the world and enjoyed by millions of people around the globe. \xc2\xa0Some foreign countries put an exorbitantly high tax on American pork -- up to 388 percent before it can be imported into another country. \xc2\xa0Obviously those tariffs would be *[reduced and in some cases] eliminated under the TPP.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso consider Alabama, a state that is known for producing iron and steel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And good football.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And good football. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the tax on football would be affected by the TPP, but the tax on iron and steel -- it\xe2\x80\x99s as high as 20 percent in some TPP countries -- would be eliminated.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust two more examples. \xc2\xa0Everybody knows about cheese in Wisconsin. \xc2\xa0Other countries in the TPP currently have a foreign tax on Wisconsin cheese of up to 40 percent -- a tax that would be *[reduced and in some cases] eliminated under the TPP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd last, and certainly not least, a state that\xe2\x80\x99s close to my heart, the great state of Missouri -- the \xe2\x80\x9cShow Me State\xe2\x80\x9d -- produces barbecue sauce that is world renowned. \xc2\xa0This is barbecue sauce that currently faces in some countries a foreign tax as high as 30 percent. \xc2\xa0And in Missouri we believe that everybody should have the benefits of enjoying delicious barbecue sauce. \xc2\xa0And so we want to make sure that we, by moving forward with the TPP, we can eliminate that foreign tax on barbecue sauce, as well. \xc2\xa0What could be more American than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that preview, and the possibility that we may refer to these slides again over the course of the briefing, we can go to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s next -- sock puppets? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Whatever it takes, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about Syria. \xc2\xa0How fearful is the White House that the conflict there is turning into some sort of a proxy war between the U.S. and Russia, given that both sides are providing different rebel groups with weapons, and a lot of these groups are on different sides of the conflict?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene, I think the President was fairly definitive in the news conference that he did 10 or 12 days ago in which he made clear that the conflict in Syria would not turn into a proxy war between the United States and Russia. \xc2\xa0That is a firm commitment that the President has made, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we will abide by.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason for that -- there are a couple of reasons for that. \xc2\xa0The first is that we would welcome Russia\xe2\x80\x99s constructive contribution to the broader international coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s been formed to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0Russia has declined to make that constructive contribution thus far. \xc2\xa0But that continues to be something that we\xe2\x80\x99re open to. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, the efforts of our international coalition that was built and led by the United States is one that is focused on ISIL. \xc2\xa0This is a multi-pronged strategy focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0Russia claims to share that goal. \xc2\xa0Thus far, we believe that they\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued a strategy that actually undermines the effective pursuit of that goal. \xc2\xa0But we would welcome a change in their strategy to more effectively accomplish that goal that they have claimed to set out for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe final thing is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority when it comes to confronting a very difficult situation in Syria is the safety and security of the American people. \xc2\xa0And that is why there are any number of military strikes that the President has ordered against extremists operating inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0In some cases, these are ISIL extremists. \xc2\xa0In some cases, these are extremists not affiliated with ISIL but yet leading extremist organizations, trying to capitalize on the chaos in Syria to plan and execute terror attacks against the United States and our interests around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is the focus of our efforts there, and there certainly is ample rhetoric that we see from Republican critics essentially goading the President to try to engage in a proxy war with Russia. \xc2\xa0They say that ostensibly because they think maybe that it makes them look tough, but I think they would have a very difficult time articulating why that would be in the clear national security interest of the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Being committed to something is one thing. \xc2\xa0How do you -- and I understand that you say that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to keeping it from becoming a proxy war, but how do you actually prevent it from turning into that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think by ensuring that our efforts are focused on ISIL. \xc2\xa0And there is a multifaceted strategy that we have put forward to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and it is countering ISIL that is the focal point of our efforts inside of Syria right now. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that that will also lead to the kind of political transition that would reduce the level of chaos inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Countering Russia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in Syria doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rate nearly as high on the scale.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday at the State Department, Spokesman John Kirby said that the U.S. was still monitoring reports of the conviction of the Washington Post reporter, Jason Rezaian, and that the U.S. hadn\xe2\x80\x99t received any official confirmation that he had been convicted. \xc2\xa0Do you have any sort of an update on that today? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is not much clarity about the current trial of Jason Rezaian, the United States citizen currently being held in Iran. \xc2\xa0There have been sporadic reports, and apparently a confirmation or two from a spokesman affiliated with the justice system there, indicating that Mr. Rezaian has been convicted. \xc2\xa0But we have not heard that through official channels, and there obviously has been no formal announcement of such a conviction.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly surprising that the situation is unclear because the entire proceedings against him have been opaque. \xc2\xa0And that has been a principal concern that we\xe2\x80\x99ve articulated with his unjust detention. \xc2\xa0Throughout this process, there has been an unwillingness on the part of the Iranians to be candid about what their intentions are. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, what is clear is that their intention is to continue to detain him unjustly, and that is something that we are quite concerned about in the same way that we\xe2\x80\x99re quite concerned about the unjust detention of Amir Hekmati and Saeed Abedini inside of Iran. \xc2\xa0We also have concerns about the whereabouts of the U.S. citizen, Robert Levinson, who was last known to be inside of Iran. \xc2\xa0But we have not gotten cooperation from the Iranians in trying to -- that we would like to get to determine Mr. Levinson\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a number of concerns, and the lack of clarity around this particular situation is not surprising. \xc2\xa0In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kind of sham process that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been running over there for several years now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally, what is your sense on whether the President will watch some or all of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s debate, or will he wait for the highlights in the morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the President catches part of the debate tonight. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he will watch it wire to wire. \xc2\xa0There is some pretty good playoff baseball on tonight. \xc2\xa0So I would anticipate that he may be doing a little channel surfing. \xc2\xa0But the President is certainly interested in the debate, and what he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t catch live and in person I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he will see in the coverage of the debate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as mentioned in the context of the two Republican debates that have been held so far, this kind of robust discussion in public, in front of the American people, where the candidates lay out their vision and priorities for the country is good for our democracy and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity for the American people and voters to carefully consider the platform on which each candidate is running. \xc2\xa0And the President welcomes a robust, healthy, vigorous debate about the many opportunities and challenges that are facing the country right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted to get your response to Iranian ballistic missile testing over the weekend, which appears to be in violation of the U.N. ban against their using ballistic missiles. \xc2\xa0The Defense Minister said that Iran would not ask permission to strengthen its defense and missile capabilities. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. response? \xc2\xa0And how does that bode for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s capability to hold up its end of the agreement and the Iran nuclear agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, the missile tests that we did see over the weekend are -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got strong indications that those missile tests did violate a U.N. Security Council resolution that pertain to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile activities. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not new. \xc2\xa0We have seen Iran on -- almost serially violate the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their ballistic missile program. \xc2\xa0And the U.N. Security Council resolution actually gives the international community some tools to interdict some equipment and material that could be used to advance their ballistic missile program, and gives us the ability to work in concert with our partners around the world to engage a strategy to try to disrupt continued progress of their ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this is altogether separate from the nuclear agreement that Iran reached with the rest of the world. \xc2\xa0In contrast to the repeated violations of the U.N. Security Council resolution that pertains to their ballistic missile activities, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that Iran over the last couple of years has demonstrated a track record of abiding by the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the context of the nuclear talks. \xc2\xa0And there was a lot of skepticism. \xc2\xa0Remember, even two or three years ago in the early stages of the nuclear talks, many critics of the administration said that engaging in these kinds of talks would be counterproductive because there was no way that Iran would abide by the commitments that they made. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, Iran had previously used the cover of talks to make progress on their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut over the last two or three years, we have seen Iran live up to some very tough standards when it comes to limiting their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And that said, we have been saying all along that the nuclear agreement that Iran reached with the rest of the world will not be predicated on trust, but it will be predicated on the most robust, intrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we will be able to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the nuclear agreement. \xc2\xa0And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, there is a very specified set of responses that can be implemented to respond to those violations. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach that we have taken thus far. \xc2\xa0It does hold the potential of us succeeding in expanding the breakout period for Iran, preventing them from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And in fact, if Iran does verifiably uphold the terms of this agreement, it would do more to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon than even a military strike would. \xc2\xa0And that is why the President has pursued this course, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that we will seek to implement, consistent with the agreement that was reached a couple of months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Iraq has started bombing Islamic State targets with help from the intelligence center that\xe2\x80\x99s run by Russia, Iran and Syria partners. \xc2\xa0Does the White House welcome the attacks because they\xe2\x80\x99re against the Islamic State, or is there some skepticism about the way Iraq is coordinating these attacks with Iraq, Iran and Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me start by observing the obvious, which is that Iraq is a sovereign nation in a complex region of the world. \xc2\xa0And with the possible exception of Syria, no nation has faced a greater threat from ISIL that Iraq; that the security situation in Iraq in the summer of 2014 was virtually turned upside down by the rapid ISIL advance across western and even significant parts of northern Iraq. \xc2\xa0And it has required Iraq to undertake a political transition and have a government that is much more effective in unifying the nation of Iraq across sectarian lines. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s had a corresponding positive impact on the ability of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s security forces to take the fight to ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we know that ISIL is a determined enemy, and that it will ultimately be a long effort to degrade and ultimately destroy them. \xc2\xa0In fact, that is why we built a multi-nation coalition of some 65 different nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And that coalition has worked effectively with the Iraqis to make progress against ISIL inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0And we believe that those coordinated efforts, through our counter-ISIL coalition, will be more effective than the unilateral efforts of nations like Russia and Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The Taliban has said that they\xe2\x80\x99re pulling out of -- or they have pulled out of Kunduz in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0I wanted to get your reaction to that, and also see if that might have an impact on the broader discussion of when to withdrawal troops from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Toluse, we have seen those reports. \xc2\xa0And obviously, that is a welcome sign. \xc2\xa0I think it is an indication that the Afghan national security forces do have a significant capability that\xe2\x80\x99s been built up over the last few years, thanks in no small part to the dedication of the NATO force that\xe2\x80\x99s operating in Afghanistan to train, equip and advise the Afghan national security forces. \xc2\xa0So the fact that they were overrun in Kunduz in the first place was a setback, but their ability to regroup and retake the city is an indication of the resilience and capability of the Afghan security forces. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I mentioned before, the President does have a policy decision to make as it relates to our future military presence inside of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And certainly, conditions on the ground will influence that process, but they will not dictate the outcome; that there are a range of considerations that the President will factor in, in making that decision. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you at this point on what that decision will be or when it will be announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask about the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0There are reports that the U.S. is planning to send a warship to some of the contested waters, potentially within 12 nautical miles of some of the islands that have been built there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, specifically because China has said that they would not condone their territorial waters being breached, what your message would be to the Chinese on this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President delivered a pretty clear and resounding message in the Rose Garden when he was standing next to President Xi at the end of last month, in which he declared -- not for the first time -- that the United States will continue to sail, fly and operate anywhere in the world that international law allows.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is that the Department of Defense regularly conducts freedom-of-navigation operations around the world. \xc2\xa0My colleagues at the NSC pulled some statistics for me that I thought were interesting. \xc2\xa0In 2014, the Department of Defense challenged the excessive maritime claims of 18 different nations. \xc2\xa0These are nations as diverse as Iran, around the Strait of Hormuz, and other nations with whom we have much warmer relations -- nations like Nicaragua, India and Brazil.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of reasons that the Department of Defense would carry out operations like this, so it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not a situation where the Chinese would be singled out. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sort of policy announcements to share with you, other than what the President said in the Rose Garden when he was standing next to President Xi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I wanted to ask about the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0It was I guess approved by the Iranian parliament. \xc2\xa0First, do you have any reaction to it being approved over there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that was actually the one thing I was -- that I failed to mention in response to Julia\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no expert in Iranian politics, but I suspect that it is no coincidence that shortly after the Majlis signed off on the Iran deal that there was a decision made by some inside of Iran to conduct a ballistic missile test that garnered the strong opposition and objection of the international community. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I wanted to make that observation first.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to the approval, however, other than to point to it as an indication that we continue to be on a path toward the successful implementation of this international agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just a follow up on that. \xc2\xa0There was a report in Fox News a couple days ago about the foreign subsidiary loophole that\xe2\x80\x99s part of this deal -- that when sanctions would be relaxed, that U.S. companies that have foreign subsidiaries would also have their sanctions relaxed. \xc2\xa0And there was a question as to whether or not that violates a previous law that was signed in 2012 that says that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that the U.S. cannot relax those sanctions unless certain conditions are met. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the legality of this deal continues to sort of be in question, and whether that specific clause is something that the White House has looked at.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the specific report that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing, Toluse. \xc2\xa0I will say there is no question at all about the legality of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0And just to be clear, Iran will not get sanctions relief under this deal until they have taken significant and verifiable steps to significantly curtail their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And this is everything from -- just as a reminder, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this many times -- disconnecting thousands of centrifuges, to reducing their stockpile by 98 percent, or essentially gutting the core of the heavy-water reactor at Arak. \xc2\xa0So these are significant steps that Iran still must take before any sanctions relief will be offered. \xc2\xa0And there is no denying the legal justification of moving forward with this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you all planning for any legal challenges? \xc2\xa0I know previous things the President has endorsed have been held up in court, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if this is something that you\xe2\x80\x99re preparing for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any legal challenges that have been filed against the effort to implement this deal. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be -- if any challenges are filed, we certainly would feel confident about our ability to prevail in a court of law.<br/>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you said that there are strong indications that this missile test violated the U.N. Security Council resolutions. \xc2\xa0Why can\xe2\x80\x99t you be more affirmative and say that it did or did not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I asked this question myself this morning, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is an overly lawyered construction. \xc2\xa0I think the sense is that there\xe2\x80\x99s more information about the specifics of the missile launch that need to be collected before a definitive statement can be made about whether or not it is in violation of this existing U.N. Security Council resolution. \xc2\xa0But based on what has been reported publicly, there are strong indications that it is a violation of those Security Council resolutions that are on the books.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then you referred to a scale of U.S. interests in Syria, starting with preventing attacks on U.S. targets, and then including countering ISIL, countering Russia. \xc2\xa0Could you put more U.S. interests in this constellation and explain to me what\xe2\x80\x99s the -- obviously you said what the core one is. \xc2\xa0What are the other ones? \xc2\xa0Where does, for example, regional stability fit into this? \xc2\xa0Where does abating the humanitarian crisis fit into this? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the order here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s probably hard for me to give you a real specific description because it\xe2\x80\x99s something I just made up as we were talking about at the beginning here. \xc2\xa0But I can certainly articulate to you what our priorities are, and the top priority is clearly the safety and security of the American people. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked at length about the strikes that have been taken inside of Syria to take extremists off the battlefield. \xc2\xa0Some of those are ISIL-affiliated operatives; in some cases they are extremists not affiliated with ISIL, but dangerous nonetheless. \xc2\xa0So that is clearly the top priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tDegrading and ultimately destroying ISIL is a significant priority both because of the national security threat that they pose to the United States, but also because of the degree to which they have caused instability throughout an already volatile region of the world. \xc2\xa0There also is a focus on -- or a priority placed upon completing a long-overdue political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0We have pointed to the political problems inside of Syria and the failed political leadership of President Assad as the root cause of so many of these problems. \xc2\xa0And even the Russians have acknowledged that a political transition will be necessary to get to the root cause of so many of these problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the scale of the humanitarian crisis that has been caused by the violence inside of Syria is significant and even historic. \xc2\xa0To see millions of people fleeing Syria, and millions of other people displaced inside of Syria fleeing violence is a significant challenge. \xc2\xa0This is a political conflict that has turned violent, that has upended the lives of millions of innocent Syrians. \xc2\xa0And the United States continues to be the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to this crisis. \xc2\xa0And as recently as just a couple of weeks ago we announced that the subtotal of our assistance now was up to about $4.5 billion. \xc2\xa0That is a significant commitment of U.S. resources to try to meet the basic humanitarian needs of Syrian citizens who are just in a terrible, desperate situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I would characterize those as our top priorities. \xc2\xa0And, Olivier, the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly concerned about trying to mobilize a strategy to counter Russia inside of Syria is that Russia is operating from a position of weakness. \xc2\xa0Syria is home to the only Russian military outpost outside of the former Soviet Union. \xc2\xa0And four or five years ago, that was an outpost that was generously protected by a tyrant in the form of Bashar al-Assad. \xc2\xa0But because of Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership, because of the chaos that has been sown into that country, the security situation around that military base and about the government that led the country where that military based was located, a lot of concerns were raised about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s investment in that country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so Russia, for years, has been trying to address this problem in a variety of ways -- offering political support to Assad, offering financial support to Assad, offering some other material forms of support to the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And now, Russia, seeing that each of those contributions was insufficient, has now had to mobilize a significant commitment of military assets to try to shore up Assad and protect their military investment inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why countering Russia\xe2\x80\x99s activities in that country doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rate nearly as high on the scale as those other priorities that I outlined.<br/>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0As you know, highway funding expires October 29th. \xc2\xa0One of the things that Paul Ryan was supposed to be thinking about was ways to pay for a highway bill -- a long-term highway bill. \xc2\xa0Now, with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s race open, are you concerned that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be another short-term extension of highway funding?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President acknowledged in his news conference, and I think maybe even response to your question, that there certainly was the potential that the upheaval around the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s race could have an impact on the ability of Congress to fulfill all of their basic obligations, including ensuring that the transportation trust fund doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run out. \xc2\xa0And that was even before Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race. \xc2\xa0So the turmoil there has only multiplied since the President acknowledged that that was the case. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, at this point, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a strong case. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s one, I think, that is quite well received on Capitol Hill, which is there is strong bipartisan support for investments in infrastructure projects that we know are good for the local economies of communities all across the country. \xc2\xa0And traditionally, investments in transportation infrastructure have garnered strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, and we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they will again. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese repeated short-term extensions are certainly not an effective way for state governments across the country to plan what in some cases are particularly complicated transportation infrastructure projects. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to plan and execute an infrastructure project that would take place over two or three years, getting funded in two- or three-month increments is going to be problematic. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has put forward his own plan for a long-term extension of the transportation funding stream. \xc2\xa0And what the President envisions is not just an extension of that funding stream at current levels, but actually a significant increase in the investment that\xe2\x80\x99s made in transportation infrastructure. \xc2\xa0The President also put forward a very specific way for paying for it, because he believes that we can do that in a fiscally responsible way. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see Congress act. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made this observation before -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not waiting on Congress to take some sort of ambitious step forward in pursuit of a visionary proposal for the country. \xc2\xa0We just want Congress to do the bare minimum. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re just asking for members of Congress to fulfill their basic responsibility -- to pass a budget, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States, and make sure that we can have a 21st-century infrastructure in the United States. \xc2\xa0These are not -- again, as much as I would like to tout the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal -- and I have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it trends toward the visionary. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are basic fundamental responsibilities of the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0And far too often, over the last four years, under Republican leadership, we have seen Congress stub their toe time and time again in trying to fulfill these basic functions. \xc2\xa0And there are a lot of reasons for that, but we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that maybe -- that Republicans in Congress will figure out that these basic responsibilities that are so clearly in the best interest of the American people will start to take precedent over the strongly held ideological views of some vocal members of their conference.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you believe then that Speaker Boehner, in his last couple weeks left, needs to put the highway bill and the debt ceiling increase on the floor, work with Democrats, and get that passed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Speaker Boehner himself has made a reference to his willingness to clean out the barn before he leaves. \xc2\xa0And as I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned previously, that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness on the part of those of us here at the White House to grab a mop or a hose, or whatever is required --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Shovel?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0-- a shovel -- we stand ready to help. \xc2\xa0And so we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that many of these kinds of things will be on the table for discussion prior to Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s departure.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0In the interview that the President gave to 60 Minutes, he was asked about Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email server. \xc2\xa0And he said -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9cI can tell you this is not a situation in which America\xe2\x80\x99s national security was in danger.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0How does he know that? \xc2\xa0Because there\xe2\x80\x99s two inspector generals that disagree, and the FBI is investigating.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President was making an observation about what we know so far, which is that Secretary Clinton herself has turned over a bunch of email to the State Department. \xc2\xa0And the review that email has garnered some differing assessments about what\xe2\x80\x99s included in there, but she made clear that nothing that was stamped \xe2\x80\x9cClassified\xe2\x80\x9d was sent to her from that email account. \xc2\xa0And we know that to be true based on what has been collected so far.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think what the President was observing is that Secretary Clinton has acknowledged that this was a mistake. \xc2\xa0But she is cooperating with the inspectors general who are taking a look at this, and even with a partisan investigation on Capitol Hill -- the eighth one -- to take a look at this. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the right thing for her to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard you many times, for a variety of different topics, say, I cannot comment on an ongoing investigation. \xc2\xa0There is an ongoing counterintelligence investigation on this. \xc2\xa0Why did the President decide to comment, given that the FBI is looking at this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, he made that observation based on what is publicly known now, and what we publicly know now is that no information that was stamped \xe2\x80\x9cClassified\xe2\x80\x9d was sent to or sent from that particular email server.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should his comments be read as an attempt to steer the direction of that FBI investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Of course not. \xc2\xa0The President certainly respects the independence and integrity of independent investigations, including those that are conducted by the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President watch the debate tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as I mentioned to Darlene, I would anticipate that the President will probably see some of the debate on television tonight, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also some playoff baseball on television tonight. \xc2\xa0So I imagine the President might be doing some channel surfing. \xc2\xa0But he certainly will be aware of the highlights and aware of the coverage, and interested in the kind of robust debate that he believes is good for the country and good for our democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry if you went over this --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- in the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure quite how to ask this, but in his discussions with Vice President Biden, has this issue of him not participating in the debate ever come up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have made it a point to not read out the private conversations between the President and the Vice President on a variety of topics, including the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s possible presidential aspiration. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it\xe2\x80\x99s come up, but even if I did, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to talk about it from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I respect that. \xc2\xa0And respectfully, is there a sense here that at some point in the very near future the Vice President will make a decision, or needs to make a decision? \xc2\xa0Because this has become a headline, for better or worse, and --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the Vice President himself has, in a couple of different public settings, acknowledged that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make a decision relatively soon. \xc2\xa0And it has been our position here since over the summer that Vice President Biden will be given all of the time and space that he needs to reach this decision. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously doing what he needs to do in order to consider that possibility, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll make a decision and announce it on a timeframe of his choosing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So these notions that the clock is ticking are perhaps -- your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that is a matter of simple physics when it comes to time and space here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So I would stipulate that that\xe2\x80\x99s true. \xc2\xa0But in terms of what sort of pressures he\xe2\x80\x99s facing in terms of his timeframe for getting in the race, those are pressures that he\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate independently, and obviously will factor into his decision, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s television watching -- and forgive me if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked -- Donald Trump is going to host Saturday Night Live. \xc2\xa0Will he watch that? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I actually had not heard that, but it sounds interesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have it from very high sources that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you do. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet you do. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President will watch that or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s never done the show himself. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s participated, but he\xe2\x80\x99s never hosted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that President Obama has hosted the show, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been on -- had a walk-on appearance three or four times, I believe. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Was Vladimir Putin wrong when he said to TASS yesterday, we could have used the money that we set aside for the Syrian fighter program and done a much better job of fighting international terrorism than the U.S. did?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those specific comments, but I would say that right now the money that Russia is using to try to shore up their investment inside of Syria is, frankly, good money that they\xe2\x80\x99re throwing after bad. \xc2\xa0The longstanding efforts that Russia has been engaged in over the last four or five years to try to prop up the Assad regime have not succeeded. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, this doubling-down we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the Russians on the Assad regime is a losing bet and is only likely to draw Russia further into a sectarian conflict, even a quagmire, and it certainly does raise significant questions about their purported strategy to go after extremists.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, the strategy that they\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in right now only makes it harder to build up the capacity of a moderate opposition that would be part of a political transition, and only puts Russia at greater risk of facing the anger and ire of otherwise moderate Syrian opposition figures who are hoping for a political transition inside that country. \xc2\xa0And continued strikes at moderate opposition targets inside of Syria only emboldens ISIL. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some reports out of Syria, including around Aleppo, where Russia has taken strikes against moderate opposition fighters that have actually paved the way for ISIL to capitalize on the weakness of the moderate opposition in that region of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so by striking non-extremist targets and not focusing on ISIL, Russia is allowing ISIL to fester and expand, and make itself more of a target by violent extremists in Syria and potentially back at home.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of, I want to sort of understand your mindset when you say the U.S. will not engage in a proxy war in Syria. \xc2\xa0The President made that very clearly understood, but I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand or square what\xe2\x80\x99s your definition of a proxy war if we\xe2\x80\x99re funding opposition fighters and they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting against Russian-supported forces. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of the definition of a proxy war?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess, Kevin, the goal of U.S. involvement inside of Syria is focused on our counter-ISIL strategy -- and that is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And some of the support that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing to elements of the Syrian moderate opposition -- support that\xe2\x80\x99s been ramped up in just the last few days -- is geared toward trying to drive ISIL out of different regions of Syria, principally in northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0And we did talk at the end of last week about the renewed support that the United States will be offering to Syrian Arabs, and the Department of Defense did confirm over the weekend that an Air Force C-17 aircraft dropped small-arms ammunition to Syrian Arab groups fighting ISIL in northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0And that successful airdrop provided ammunition to those Syrian Arab groups whose leaders were vetted by the United States and have been fighting to move ISIL out of northeastern Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s what our strategy is, and that is a strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on ISIL, is a strategy that has the strong support of the international community -- some 65 nations who are part of our coalition. \xc2\xa0And that stands in stark contrast to the unilateral efforts of the Russians to indiscriminately strike opposition groups with the goal of propping up the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And it is clear that our intentions are quite different than theirs, despite what the Russian government says publicly. \xc2\xa0Russia regularly claims to be focused on countering ISIL, but that certainly is not what we see when it comes to evaluating their efforts on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you hear about the report that U.S. aircraft and Russian aircraft were close enough, within miles, to make visual identification?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I have heard those reports. \xc2\xa0For the details of that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0I mean, the other thing that I do know also occurred over the weekend is that there was a follow-up conversation between U.S. military officials and Russian military officials to pursue our de-confliction efforts inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere was a preliminary conversation a couple of weeks ago and there was another conversation over the weekend to follow up on those efforts. \xc2\xa0And we continue to want to be focused on the practical, operational-level discussions that will make the environment for our military pilots operating in the skies over Syria at least a little safer and make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t run -- or make sure that the Russian efforts don\xe2\x80\x99t run headlong into our ongoing operations. \xc2\xa0And thus far, there\xe2\x80\x99s been no need for the United States or our coalition partners to in any way curtail our efforts as a result of what Russia is doing in Syria right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last one on Biden. \xc2\xa0Given that there seems to be growing space between some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and the presumptive frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, but there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be any space between what the President believes and what Vice President Biden believes, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about continuing the process that was started and continues over the past seven-plus years, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make sense then that he would be the best mouthpiece to keep it going? \xc2\xa0The best representative to keep the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies moving forward, not Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, as I acknowledged last week, that in any presidential election there will be an obligation placed on each of the candidates to clearly articulate their views and priorities and policies. \xc2\xa0And that means they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to distinguish themselves among each other but also between themselves and the incumbent. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s part of any presidential race. \xc2\xa0And the fact is -- I said this last week as well -- no matter how good the first two terms have been, nobody is going to run a successful campaign predicated on essentially a third term. \xc2\xa0Each of these candidates is going to have to go out and make their own independent case. \xc2\xa0And if Vice President Biden decides to get in the race, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do the same thing. \xc2\xa0But ultimately that will be a decision for him to make.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that he right now has articulated the same kind of positions that the President sought to advance is because he is a loyal Vice President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to do when you\xe2\x80\x99re Vice President. \xc2\xa0If and when he decides to become a presidential candidate, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to more clearly articulate his own personal views on some things. \xc2\xa0I think the vast majority of those views will be in line with what the President has pursued. \xc2\xa0But I think, as you would expect from anybody that has as much experience that he does, that there might be some policy areas where he differs not just with President Obama, but also with Secretary Clinton and others with whom he served inside this administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make the debate a lot more fun, though, if he were to show up tonight? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys decide how the ratings would be affected by Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the race. \xc2\xa0So I suspect this is something that my friends at CNN have considered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll never match our numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the same subject, really, I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s more than coincidence that your fabulous graphics today came on the day of this first debate when in that area is where you\xe2\x80\x99re probably going to see the greatest distance between these front-running candidates and the President. \xc2\xa0And what effect do you think that opposition to the TPP is going to have on support for it and its ultimate passage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it is a coincidence -- because as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, I had originally intended to show these on Friday, but other events intervened. \xc2\xa0So I did coincidentally have the opportunity to share them with you today. \xc2\xa0I do think it does serve as a pretty powerful illustration of the economic benefits of implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that was negotiated by this administration with 11 other countries in the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0We actually have -- I showed slides for six or eight different states; there are actually slides for all 50 and we can share those with you if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut ultimately we would expect for there to be a robust discussion and debate in the context of a presidential campaign about the wisdom of pursuing agreements like this one. \xc2\xa0The President obviously has his own very strong views about how this agreement will benefit middle-class families. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just point out that the debate about trade over the summer did not have an impact on our ability to build a bipartisan coalition in Congress to support trade promotion authority legislation. \xc2\xa0And while we certainly would welcome support from anybody who has to offer it, we\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly concerned about the impact it will have on the congressional debate just based solely on our experience over the summer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Several times now you mentioned how much the administration welcomes robust debate, that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for democracy. \xc2\xa0So given that there\xe2\x80\x99s been so much debate now over the number of Democratic debates, would the President then welcome more Democratic debates? \xc2\xa0Or does he think that there should be more of them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the President articulate a view on this. \xc2\xa0This is obviously something that the Democratic National Committee has to work out and organize not just among the candidates, but among the media organizations that are eager to sponsor those kind of engagements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How about you then, Josh? \xc2\xa0Do you think that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess my sense is that over the course of two and a half hours tonight there will be ample discussion of public policy. \xc2\xa0Look, it will be up to the candidates to -- I guess the other thing that I would say is that, certainly with all due respect to the news organizations that devote significant time and resources to organizing these kinds of engagements, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only way to have a debate about public policy. \xc2\xa0That there are opportunities for candidates to make public speeches, to host town hall meetings; that that\xe2\x80\x99s part of taking the public debate to the electorate. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for our democracy. \xc2\xa0And many people lament the length of presidential campaigns in this country, and there are certainly a number of downsides to the length of these kinds of campaigns. \xc2\xa0But the one upside is that it certainly does ensure that we have -- and when I saw \xe2\x80\x9cwe,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean as an American citizen and as an American voter, we have ample opportunity to consider the policies and priorities and agenda of everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s running for President, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And going back to that 60 Minutes interview, I know you just said that the President made those comments on whether or not Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s email issue was a national security issue based on what is publicly known. \xc2\xa0But given that the investigation is still going on, was he trying to preclude the results of that investigation? \xc2\xa0Or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely not. \xc2\xa0The President has a healthy respect for the kinds of independent investigations that are conducted by inspectors general and, where necessary, by the FBI.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the question then. \xc2\xa0So if he has a healthy respect for an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing, to the point that you guys almost never want to say anything about that subject, then why would he say so confidently that it is not -- or was not a national security issue? \xc2\xa0Why would he say that as a statement of fact?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think because that was the question -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the transcript right in front of me. \xc2\xa0I think that was directly the question that he was asked, and so he was trying to answer the question based on what we all know right now publicly about this particular case. \xc2\xa0But that certainly was not an attempt in any way to undermine the importance or independence of the ongoing FBI investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does he, in fact, not know until the results of the investigation whether or not this could have had an impact on national security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that what the President -- based on what the President knows now, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what all of us know now, the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t speaking based on any information that has not yet been made public. \xc2\xa0But based on what has been made public and based on the public pronouncements of Secretary Clinton herself, that\xe2\x80\x99s how the President arrived at the conclusion that this has not and does not pose a threat to national security. \xc2\xa0But obviously the FBI will take their own independent look at this. \xc2\xa0And for questions about the status of that investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.<br/>\n\tMara.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you were asked about this before, the rumors about Iran wanting 19 prisoners, perhaps to swap Jason Rezaian. \xc2\xa0And do you know anything about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that the Iranians have discussed previously. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you at this point on our ongoing efforts to secure the release of either Mr. Rezaian or Mr. Abedini, Mr. Hekmati, or to learn more about the whereabouts of Mr. Levinson, other than to tell you that the cases of those individuals continues to be a top priority for this government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you heard Secretary Kerry himself, after the talks were concluded, say that he raised the status of those American citizens who are unjustly detained in Iran right now in every single engagement he had with his Iranian counterpart. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication to you of the priority that this administration places on the safe return of those American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one question about your slideshow. \xc2\xa0It struck me that this is the way that administrations have sold trade deals for like 20 years, talking about these products in the states they\xe2\x80\x99re in. \xc2\xa0I guess I was surprised, because the trade debate has really moved on to a different stage, especially in the Democratic Party, where Democratic voters say, sure, the guys who own the leather boot company or the bourbon company or the guys --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The barbecue sauce company.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yeah, the barbecue sauce company -- they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make out fine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to produce jobs. \xc2\xa0And trade deals have actually hurt us rather than helped us. \xc2\xa0I mean, that is a big, widespread view, whether you agree with it or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t your sale\xe2\x80\x99s pitch deal with that anxiety directly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that question a couple of ways. \xc2\xa0The very first time we started talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, I spent a lot of time emphasizing how this agreement includes the toughest labor and environmental standards that have ever been included in a trade deal. \xc2\xa0And the argument that is made by many is that the labor standards in other countries give them an unfair advantage over American workers, which is how they get an unfair benefit from trade deals. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely what the President has rectified by trying to level the playing field for American workers and American businesses. \xc2\xa0And the benefits are significant.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we talk about -- and I guess I also want to turn you to the Ohio example because it\xe2\x80\x99s an illustrative one. \xc2\xa0We spend a lot of time talking about how important it is for the United States to counter China\xe2\x80\x99s repeated efforts to dump tires into the American market; that this has the effect of putting American businesses and American workers at a competitive disadvantage. \xc2\xa0When the administration has taken decisive action to question those practices at the WTO -- and every time we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a verdict from the WTO, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a ruling in our favor, which means we have succeeded in advocating for American products -- that is a victory that has been roundly cheered by not just the owners of the tire companies, but also by the union representatives of the employees of that tire company.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the fact is, if we can protect unfair trade practices by China in the United States and have that be good for American workers, then being able to advocate for American goods overseas should also be good for American workers. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the consistency that you find in our argument, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a consistency that unfortunately is not present in the argument of many of our critics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s always been a tough sell for Democrats to get the votes for trade deals. \xc2\xa0Why do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s become so much harder?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that it\xe2\x80\x99s harder --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But every single Democratic candidate came out against TPP -- a Democratic President\xe2\x80\x99s big policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, but I guess my point is I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that\xe2\x80\x99s something -- you\xe2\x80\x99re more of a student of previous debates about trade agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s just as hard as it\xe2\x80\x99s always been?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that I\xe2\x80\x99m making. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve not sought to downplay that. \xc2\xa0I think we certainly have -- there are a number of things -- elements in our case to make about why Democrats should support this trade agreement, even if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t historically supported trade agreements. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s because it includes the toughest labor standards that have ever been included in a trade deal. \xc2\xa0It includes the highest environmental standards that have ever been included in a trade deal. \xc2\xa0And there are some significant documented economic benefits associated with this trade deal, primarily because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a trade agreement that has an impact on 40 percent of the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about opening up opportunity for American businesses overseas, this is a lot of opportunity that\xe2\x80\x99s out there. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about some of the countries that have some of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess the point is that we feel strongly about making sure that this trade agreement is consistent with the kinds of values that the President has championed throughout his career in public service, long before he even thought about running for President, but also making sure that we maximize the benefits that are associated with these kinds of agreements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You haven\xe2\x80\x99t put a jobs number on this trade deal, have you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that we have, but you can check with USTR to see if they have any kind of projection to offer.<br/>\n\tArlette.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Congressman Paul Ryan is considering running for Speaker, and he\xe2\x80\x99s shown a few examples where he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to compromise the Ryan-Murray budget of 2013 as an example. \xc2\xa0Would the White House like to see a Speaker Paul Ryan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think as I mentioned at the end of last week, it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that an endorsement of anybody -- by me, from here -- would be helpful to any Republican\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo rather than try to navigate that twisted knot of political complexity, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to let Republicans decide for themselves who they believe should lead the Republican conference. \xc2\xa0What I will observe, though, is that whomever that person is, they will face the same kind of challenge that Speaker Boehner has faced for the last several years, which is that there is a small but loud contingent in the Republican conference that, time and again, has put their own rigid extremist ideology ahead of effective government that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of middle-class families all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to hold those extremists liable for the dysfunction that we see in Congress, the fact is the majority of the Republican conference could do something about it. \xc2\xa0They could stand up to those extremists in their own conference, or they could do the thing that is actually clearly in the best interest of the country, which is rather than insisting that every important thing that happens in Congress get done along party lines, actually try to cooperate with Democrats on something. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that they have to fold or concede their conservative principles. \xc2\xa0Actually, what they just need to do is negotiate with the Democratic minority so that they can get something done for the American people. \xc2\xa0And they can do that consistent with their conservative principles. \xc2\xa0It may require them to compromise a little bit. \xc2\xa0It may mean that they don\xe2\x80\x99t get 100 percent of everything that they want. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of democracy, particularly in an era where there\xe2\x80\x99s one party in charge of Congress and another party that\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Vice President Joe Biden, he\xe2\x80\x99s spent over two months now mulling very publicly this decision about 2016. \xc2\xa0And there are some who are starting --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My guess is he\xe2\x80\x99s been thinking about it even a little bit longer than that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there are some who are starting to say that he owes the Democratic Party an answer now, sooner rather than later. \xc2\xa0Do you think that the Vice President owes that to the Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I think, quite frankly, that Vice President Biden, given his service to the party and, more importantly, his service to the country, is certainly entitled to the amount of time that he believes is necessary to make what is an intensely personal decision for him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And also on the debate -- in 2008, President Obama debated against Hillary Clinton many times. \xc2\xa0What advice do you think he would give to her challengers tonight? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He did engage in dozens of debates -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s an exaggeration -- with Secretary Clinton over the course of 2007 and 2008. \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about any advice that he would offer. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that he -- I think the advice that he would offer is advice that he would offer any candidate, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re debating against Secretary Clinton or not, and that is that they should spend time preparing for those debates and be focused on communicating as clearly as possible for the American public what their priorities are, and that that will -- that the person who can most cleanly articulate their values and priorities is typically the candidate that comes away looking the best in these debates.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, every candidate will have the opportunity to do that tonight, including Secretary Clinton herself.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I have a couple subjects I want to ask you about. \xc2\xa0Back when Joe Biden -- listening to all the questions about Joe Biden, but indirectly about him. \xc2\xa0Has the White House set up some type of contingency plan if he does decide to run for President in 2016?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0So if he were to decide to run, this White House would just change and shift at that time? \xc2\xa0Or it would just function as normal with -- on the campaign trail?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me -- certainly in the context of these briefings, we spend a lot of time talking about the important tasks that Vice President Biden has taken on in that role. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason that the President in the interview with 60 Minutes described Vice President Biden as among the most consequential Vice Presidents in the history of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s because Vice President has taken on significant tasks -- everything from working on gun safety initiatives to implementing the Recovery Act, to working closely with foreign leaders in a variety of hotspots, including Iraq and Ukraine, to advance the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tVice President Biden brings an astonishing set of skills and experiences to this job. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s been such an important part of this team. \xc2\xa0And if he were to decide to dedicate some of those skills and experiences to running for President again, there would be -- that would have an impact on some of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here, but we would -- I guess the other thing is it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a scenario where Vice President Biden resigns his seat, or resigns the office. \xc2\xa0He certainly would continue to be in a position to make calls and participate in meetings. \xc2\xa0It just means that he would also have to dedicate some of this time to campaigning for the office.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the point is, yes, I would acknowledge that it would require some changes around here, but we would still benefit from Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s service as Vice President even if he chose to run for President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s say -- and this is not a hypothetical -- TPP. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s say Vice President Biden, as he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about it, he decides next week, okay, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to run. \xc2\xa0Do you have -- do you still think that you have that person to talk to congressional leaders to help push TPP forward? \xc2\xa0Or will the President be the one meeting with congressional leaders and talking --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President already has been involved in those kinds of conversations. \xc2\xa0But I certainly -- and on that scenario, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s involvement as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And the next subject, pretty simple -- criminal justice. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a markup on some bills within the next couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0What does the President primarily want to see come out of that? \xc2\xa0Because we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that the disparity in sentencing -- retroactive sentencing is one of the biggest components of both. \xc2\xa0But if something fails, what is the biggest piece that you want?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April, I think the most important thing right now, at the beginning of this process, is for Democrats and Republicans to try to move forward in bipartisan fashion. \xc2\xa0I think the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to move criminal justice reform across the finish line in Congress is if Democrats and Republicans work together to get it done. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require, as I mentioned earlier, a willingness to compromise. \xc2\xa0And it means that Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get everything that they want out of this reform effort, and Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to get everything they want out of the reform effort either. \xc2\xa0But there does appear to be significant common ground in confronting some of these issues. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd while we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that a good piece of legislation will come out of this process in the Senate, at least where it started, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody that thinks that will be a perfect piece of legislation. \xc2\xa0So that willingness to compromise, that willingness to accept less than 100 percent of what ideally you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see, will be an important priority for those who are engaged in these conversations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSubstantively though, I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s been extensive discussion about sentencing reforms. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion about reforms for juvenile justice programs. \xc2\xa0I would identify those as sort of two priorities in the context of this legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0And I want to go back to something you said about TPP. \xc2\xa0You said the President is reaching out. \xc2\xa0Could you tell us how he is reaching out to congressional leaders? \xc2\xa0Is he having meetings? \xc2\xa0What? \xc2\xa0Is he on the phone? \xc2\xa0Can you tell us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to share at this point. \xc2\xa0But I mean, I think the important thing to recognize is that the vote on this agreement is quite a ways off; that the text will have to be completed and translated into a variety of different languages, be made public for 60 days before the President himself even signs it. \xc2\xa0There will be additional time for that text to be considered publicly before Congress would consider it and then it would go through the congressional process. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo a final vote on legislation is quite a ways off. \xc2\xa0But I guess what I was referring to is over the summer, when we were trying to advance trade promotion authority, the President was deeply engaged in the effort to move that across the finish line and it required him to speak to the Democratic caucus at one point and even go to the congressional baseball game. \xc2\xa0So the President was obviously very personally involved in trying to advance that legislation that was eventually successful.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no leg or groundwork right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there certainly is an effort to communicate with Capitol Hill to make sure that they understand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s been completed here to help them understand what\xe2\x80\x99s included in the agreement, but ultimately we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the text of that agreement out so that everybody can consider it for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just wanted to point out that you have an opportunity today to help the Vice President make an announcement, should he desire to do so, simply by opening up the photo-op with the President, the Attorney General, and the Vice President, which is scheduled in about 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that the Vice President has any announcements that are planned for today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we ask him? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure his office would be happy to take your call.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to open it up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back to the issue of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile test. \xc2\xa0If indeed they\xe2\x80\x99ve broken a U.N. Security Council resolution, would the U.S. countenance additional sanctions on Iran, even if that puts in jeopardy the implementation of the nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, let me just say that this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to look at. \xc2\xa0And the details of this particular launch are important to determining whether or not they are in violation of the existing United Nations Security Council resolutions that govern Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States certainly takes seriously those violations, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when the President convened a summit meeting of our Gulf Coast partners at Camp David, that there was ample discussion about countering Iran\xe2\x80\x99s malign activities in the region. \xc2\xa0And we certainly do believe that there is more work that could be done to interdict material and equipment that could be used to advance their missile program. \xc2\xa0That is work that requires international cooperation. \xc2\xa0And the President has indicated not just a willingness but even a desire to work more closely with our allies and with our partners in the Gulf Coast -- or in the Gulf to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a separate issue, on Syria, just following up on the question about de-confliction before -- reportedly the UK, the Royal Air Force in the UK is being -- pilots have been given orders to shoot down Russian aircraft if they are engaged by Russian aircraft in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0Has the President okayed any similar orders for U.S. pilots?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for any operational updates like that. \xc2\xa0The Commander-in-Chief certainly has the expectation that our military pilots, whether operating in Syria or anywhere else in the world, will take the steps they believe are necessary to protect themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And a final question -- if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me on Israel and the Palestinian territories. \xc2\xa0Is the White House concerned that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the beginnings of a third intifada? \xc2\xa0And if so, even if not, is there -- do you believe that the absence of a possible two-state solution following what was said by the Israeli Prime Minister during the election campaign has contributed to the situation on the ground that makes it more likely that that kind of intifada could take place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Andrew, let me start by saying that the United States condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks -- the recent terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, which resulted in the murder of three Israelis and left numerous others wounded. \xc2\xa0We mourn any loss of life, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Israeli or it\xe2\x80\x99s Palestinian. \xc2\xa0The United States continues to stress the importance of condemning violence and combatting the incitement, and we\xe2\x80\x99re in regular contact with both the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe continue to be deeply concerned about escalating tensions, and urge all sides to take affirmative steps to restore calm and prevent actions that would further escalate tensions. \xc2\xa0Andrew, you know the policy of the United States has been that a two-state solution that is negotiated directly between the two parties is the most effective way for us to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0And in the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99ve urged both sides to try to exercise restraint and to prevent the further escalation of tensions in a region that\xe2\x80\x99s been roiled by them for generations.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two very brief questions on Russia. \xc2\xa0Has the administration -- either through statement or in the President\xe2\x80\x99s talks with President Putin -- have either weighed in on the case of Lieutenant Nadiya Savchenko who was the Ukrainian Air Force pilot kidnapped from Ukraine, brought to Russia, put on trial in Moscow and, as of yesterday, undergoing psychiatric evaluation after her hunger strike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0John, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for the latest of our efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the other question is this: \xc2\xa0December will mark the third anniversary of the President\xe2\x80\x99s signing of the Magnitsky Act, which are sanctions against individual Russians involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky in 2009. \xc2\xa0He was a lawyer and accountant who got into a little row with the Kremlin.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, Vladimir Kara-Murza -- who was a Russian dissident who went through a poisoning in May that I think you commented on -- he said that the administration has targeted a lot of smaller-level people with sanctions, but no major figures around President Putin. \xc2\xa0Are there any plans for that kind of sanctioning to take place soon?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, John, that\'s a difficult question to answer because when it comes to sanctions, it would not be in our strategic interest to discuss what future plans we may have with regard to sanctions. \xc2\xa0If we were to discuss those plans in some detail in advance, it would only make it easier for those who may be the target of sanctions to take steps to evade them before they\'re imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department who is responsible for implementing those sanctions. \xc2\xa0They may be able to give you a sense of what they\'re considering. \xc2\xa0But I would not anticipate them being able to provide a lot of information with a lot of specificity in advance because it would only undermine our overall effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have anything on MH-17?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We can get you a statement on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
