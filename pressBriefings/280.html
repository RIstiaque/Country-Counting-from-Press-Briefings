EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It looks like we\'re taking this show on the road.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to Camp David.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, the President has completed the first working session of the summit with our GCC partners here at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 Their working lunch is ongoing right now.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll have a couple of working sessions later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to hear from the President a couple of times this afternoon before we wrap things up.</p>\n<p>So, in the context of this briefing, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes participated in the working session, the first one that took place this morning, so he\xe2\x80\x99s here to answer questions that you may have on the summit and other foreign policy questions you have.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of business getting done on Capitol Hill today, too, and I\'m happy to take those questions.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s sort of the way that we\'ll divide it up.</p>\n<p>So let me go to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess just to start, Ben, can you tell us what they discussed in the working session, presumably on Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing a number of issues throughout the day, including Iran, countering violent extremism, the counter ISIL campaign, and the regional conflicts in Yemen, Syria, Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This morning focused on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And the President and his team was able to provide an update on the status of the nuclear negotiations, and we were able to have the participation of Secretary Kerry, Secretary Lew, and Secretary Moniz to review the status of both the framework that was reached in Lausanne and the ongoing negotiations towards a comprehensive deal.</p>\n<p>Of course, in addition to discussing the nuclear negotiations, there are also discussions about concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing actions across the region which touch upon the security of our GCC partners.\xc2\xa0 So there will be ongoing discussions about what are the strategies to deal with these destabilizing actions and what are the types of capabilities that are necessary for our GCC partners to provide for their security in the current regional context.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have the final decisions on some of the things you guys talked about earlier in the week -- weapon sales, joint exercises, missile coordination -- have the final decisions on those been made yet?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s fair to say that given the preparatory work, we have a fairly clear view of where we\'ll be headed in terms of those issues.\xc2\xa0 There will be a joint statement issued out of the summit that will detail the agreements that were reached here at Camp David.\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s happening today is the leaders are able to step back, have a broad, strategic discussion that touches on all these issues, make refinements as necessary to those outcomes.</p>\n<p>And as it relates to capabilities, we\'re really looking at what we can do to expedite the provision of support and capacity-building to the GCC in areas like ballistic missile defense, maritime security, special operations, counterterrorism capacity, border security.\xc2\xa0 These are the types of capabilities that I think are directly relevant to the threats across the region to include not just destabilizing activities from Iran but also terrorist groups like ISIL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, what is being said during these meetings to discourage these Gulf state leaders from engaging in an arms race with Iran?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\'m imagining that came up during some of these conversations.\xc2\xa0 What is the President saying to address those concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, first of all, the briefing on the comprehensive deal that we\'re pursuing with the P5+1 and Iran I think is fundamental to those questions and concerns.\xc2\xa0 And our position is very clear.\xc2\xa0 Iran has had a nuclear program that has been operating for at least two decades now.\xc2\xa0 They have been continuing those actions unconstrained and often without intrusive inspection.\xc2\xa0 And our point is, under this agreement that we\'re pursuing with the Iranians, that program will be rolled back and face significant limitations that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t currently face, and there will be the most intrusive inspections regime of any arms control agreement that we\'ve ever had.\xc2\xa0 And in that context, we will be able to verify that Iran is not using its nuclear program for anything but a peaceful purpose and that they\xe2\x80\x99re abiding by the limitations that are in the deal</p>\n<p>In that context, there would be no need to see the type of regional arms race that would make an already volatile part of the world that much more unstable and unsecure.\xc2\xa0 And in fact --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there agreement on that -- on that point?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that the leaders -- I\'ll let them speak to it and the joint statement will speak to this -- but I think, first of all, we\'ve never had any indication from any of these countries that they are intending to pursue the type of domestic nuclear program that would raise concerns.\xc2\xa0 We actually have peaceful nuclear cooperation with a number of these countries -- the 123 Agreement, for instance, with the United Arab Emirates.</p>\n<p>So their concerns I think are focused on what Iran is doing across the region, and their concerns have to do with whether or not, even in the context of a nuclear deal, we are still cooperating with them to counter those destabilizing actions.\xc2\xa0 And I think we are able to provide a very clear assurance that the nuclear deal is about a specific issue, that if Iran did have a nuclear weapon, a nuclear weapon capability, its destabilizing actions would be that much more dangerous because they\xe2\x80\x99d have a nuclear umbrella.\xc2\xa0 So, therefore, we\'re aiming to resolve that issue diplomatically, but at the same time, our concerns will be just as acute the day after an agreement about those other activities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, was the President able to get any assurances from the Gulf leaders that they will back him or support the United States over an Iran agreement?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t want to get ahead of the final outcomes here, and, again, those types of questions will be addressed in both the joint statement and then we\'ll let individual countries speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think there is an appreciation for how much the nuclear deal that we\'re pursuing has unprecedented transparency and inspections associated with it, and has some very real, strict limitations.\xc2\xa0 I think the concerns, as I said, have more to do with Iranian activities around the region and the prospect of sanctions relief, which would have to be part of any deal in the context of what Iran is doing around the region.</p>\n<p>And that\'s the purpose for the meeting -- not the only purpose, but on this discussion -- to discuss what are the types of assurances, capabilities and strategies that can deal with destabilizing actions in the region, just as we\'re also dealing with threats from terrorism and regional conflicts as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s desired outcome, though?\xc2\xa0 Would he like for them to come out and say, we\'re not going to oppose this?\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you need to gather more international and domestic support?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we have huge international support for this agreement.\xc2\xa0 These are some of our closest partners in the region, though.\xc2\xa0 We want them to understand what\xe2\x80\x99s in the deal.\xc2\xa0 And because we are committed to their security, and because we cooperate on the security and stability of the region, it\'s important for them to have an understanding of what the nuclear deal is.\xc2\xa0 And, of course, we would welcome their determination that a nuclear deal can contribute to the security of the region.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we need to be working together to deal with a range of other threats and challenges as well.\xc2\xa0 So the nuclear deal is a part of this, but it\'s only one part of a much broader conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can you characterize, in this conversation about the Iran deal, if the President has drawn a distinction here as to whether he sees this as transformative, or simply a transaction?\xc2\xa0 In other words, is there a gesture towards, as the President said publicly, that this could in some way open the door towards more cooperation with Iran, which allies in Arab world are very concerned about?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter. It\'s a transaction on the nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 This is not a broader rapprochement between the United States and Iran on a range of issues; it is a very specific agreement that will deal with the Iranian nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the relief that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting from sanctions, if we are able to achieve a deal, would be the nuclear sanctions, which were put in place because of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s violation of international norms with respect to its nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99ll still be just as concerned about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities, support for terrorism and proxies across the region.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to have sanctions imposed for Iranian actions and behavior in those areas as well.</p>\n<p>So this is a nuclear deal that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on the merits of the deal itself, not as a part of a change broadly in the U.S.-Iran relationship.\xc2\xa0 If Iran, in the aftermath of a deal -- if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to conclude one -- moves and evolves in a more constructive direction, that would be good for the region.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the purpose of the deal itself.\xc2\xa0 The purpose of the deal is to address their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the expectation that there would be a change in behavior, though?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would always say about this is we would do the deal if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to get the type of deal that was in the Lausanne framework whether or not Iran changes over the next 10 or 15 years, because if Iran is just as difficult and challenging 10 or 15 years from now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a nuclear weapons capability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>However, what is also clear is they are more likely to evolve in a more constructive direction in a world in which there is a deal than in a world in which there is no deal -- because, frankly, an Iran that is in resistance and opposition to the West and America and our partners in the region has been the norm in the current context.\xc2\xa0 That may continue to be the case if there\xe2\x80\x99s a deal, but you may see an Iran that wants to be more integrated with the international community, wants to see a nuclear deal as a first step towards that integration.</p>\n<p>But again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the reason for us concluding the deal.\xc2\xa0 The reason for us concluding the deal is to address the nuclear threat.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to monitor in the years to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to go back to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question if I can.\xc2\xa0 Are you looking for assurances from these leaders that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to try to match Iran\xe2\x80\x99s enrichment capabilities as it is based on the agreement as it stands now?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We would say that these countries, and every country, that -- Iran is not the model to follow in pursuing a nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Acting outside of established international structures, covertly developing enrichment capabilities, violating a variety of different international norms, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the pathway to accessing peaceful nuclear energy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so, yes, we would say to these countries, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see any type of arms race in the region.\xc2\xa0 If there is an interest in nuclear power -- which some of these countries have had -- there are established means of accessing that power.\xc2\xa0 And again, we have, for instance, a 123 Agreement with the UAE that does exactly that -- that provides them with access to energy without having a domestic infrastructure committed to enrichment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, yes, I think our view is what we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see in the region, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing a nuclear deal, is we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a nuclear arms race in what is already the most volatile part of the world.\xc2\xa0 A deal with Iran contributes to that.\xc2\xa0 A deal with Iran should make these GCC partners more confident that Iran is further away from a nuclear weapon and that there are inspections that can verify that.\xc2\xa0 And in that context, they should work through the long-established means of accessing nuclear energy if that\xe2\x80\x99s something that they choose to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Can you just comment on sort of the -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if \xe2\x80\x9cmood\xe2\x80\x9d is the right word, but the feeling inside the room this morning?\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to, as part of that, address the absence in particular of the Saudi King and Bahrain\xe2\x80\x99s King, which has gotten a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 And I know you folks have said that these are the people who are used to working sort of in the trenches who know the details of this.\xc2\xa0 But how is it different?\xc2\xa0 And does it at least remove some of the prestige of what this gathering was supposed to be?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a very unique gathering to have leaders from the six GCC countries here at Camp David at what is a truly pivotal moment in the region.\xc2\xa0 And the goal here, really, was not to just have some photo op. the goal was to set up a game plan for our security cooperation going forward at a very volatile time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see out of this very clear assurances from the United States about the nature of our security commitments to the GCC; very concrete pathways laid out in terms of developing GCC capabilities and a U.S.-GCC partnership on security issues going forward; and also, important check-in on strategies -- on issues like Yemen and Syria and counter-ISIL that are very relevant to our shared security.</p>\n<p>In that context, as we have said, Chris, we have here very senior delegations from each country and also the people responsible for all of the different security portfolios in these countries.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Saudi Arabia, having the Crown Prince and the Deputy Crown Prince who are the individuals who have taken the lead on these strategies for Saudi Arabia in terms of security, defense, intelligence, is absolutely the appropriate representation.</p>\n<p>And on Bahrain, this morning in the session, the Crown Prince spoke at some length.\xc2\xa0 He clearly has a critical role and voice within not just Bahrain but the GCC generally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there was a good dinner last night, a good discussion to kind of set the context for the summit at the dinner last night. And the discussions, I think, are very focused on the issues -- not ceremony, but what are the practical steps that we want to take together.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any specific requests made for any particular weapons or missiles from these countries to improve their capacities and their abilities?\xc2\xa0 And in terms of your hope for a more integrated GCC defense system, what role do you envision for the United States to play and help these countries overcome their rivalries?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, there have been requests -- not just here but over the course of the last several weeks as we\xe2\x80\x99ve been preparing for the summit, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having a dialogue.\xc2\xa0 And I think some of these partners of ours have indicated, look, we recognize that there are emerging threats that we have to confront.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When you look at maritime, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition among some of the GCC partners that if they\'re concerned about potentially dangerous maritime activity that could pose a threat to them, they\'re going to have to develop new capabilities.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a desire in the counterterrorism context to have capabilities on things like special forces that the United States excels at.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, on ballistic missile defense, there\xe2\x80\x99s a desire to better integrate the different systems of the countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>All of which is to say this is new terrain in many respects in that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had significant defense relationships and a significant presence in the Gulf region, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been generally focused on large hardware.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re looking at now here in cyber, maritime, CT, special operations, border security -- these are the things that matter in a region of asymmetric threats.\xc2\xa0 They\'re not going to necessarily be large conventional conflicts.</p>\n<p>And so we are discussing and responding to their interests in those capabilities.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a role to play both in expediting the provision of those types of capabilities and building their capacity, but also in carrying out joint exercises.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there will be a clear signal out of this meeting that we\xe2\x80\x99ll want to continue to enhance and expand our joint exercises -- have capacity-building provided by the U.S. military that has relationships with each of the GCC partners, helping the GCC partners be more interoperable among themselves and with our military.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very extensive program coming out of this of cooperation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, look, the GCC countries have occasionally had differences among themselves; they\xe2\x80\x99ve occasionally had differences with us.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret to everybody in this room.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of international affairs.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t expect countries to agree on everything.\xc2\xa0 However, we do believe that, as a collective, the GCC will benefit from having the ability to cooperate and to be interoperable in dealing with threats and working with us, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a baseline of shared interests that does allow us to work together even if there are going to be occasional differences.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- find ways to bring the programs -- integrate the GCC defense system?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get into some of the more technical details later.\xc2\xa0 It differs on different areas.\xc2\xa0 There are things like ballistic missile defense that have to be worked up over some time.\xc2\xa0 There are maritime capabilities that you develop through exercises.\xc2\xa0 So I can\'t put a time frame on everything because each one of those has a different time frame attached to it.</p>\n<p>What we are going to do, though, is expedite our ability to provide that type of assistance and make sure we have a team that is working on it with them.\xc2\xa0 And we can go into some of those details after the summit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see opportunity or does he see opportunity today to address the lack of political freedoms in these countries, and human rights, like he mentioned in his interview?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So we\'re obviously focused here on security and both capabilities and strategies.\xc2\xa0 As a general matter, we regularly raise issues associated with human rights and inclusive governance with each of these countries.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t say whether or not, for sure, what will come up in the sessions that will happen this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I can say, again, as a general matter, we believe that not just for the purposes of our values, which lead us obviously to speak out for human rights, but also for purposes of addressing a variety of challenges in the region, that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to provide models that allow for inclusive political participation and also inclusive economic participation so that there are opportunities available for the people of the region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, there is another incident in the Strait of Hormuz with the Iranian boats and a Singapore flagged tanker.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if that came up at all.\xc2\xa0 That seems to be precisely what these meetings are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And what is your message to them and do you have a comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the specific incident, all I can say is that no U.S. vessels or persons were involved.\xc2\xa0 And so beyond that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to gather more information about exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But you\'re right, Carol, this is exactly the type of challenge that many of the GCC partners are focused on.\xc2\xa0 This incident didn\'t come up, but maritime threats and challenges in areas like the Straits of Hormuz are one of the types of concerns that lead us to the determination that an area of focus for the GCC in capacity-building could be maritime -- should be maritime.</p>\n<p>The U.S. is very present in terms of our naval capabilities in the region, but we also want to make sure that in addition to our capabilities, our partners are also able to deal with maritime threats.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask one other?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any updates on the report of the use chemical weapons in Syria?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys independently confirmed that yourselves?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have not.\xc2\xa0 We have not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the maritime issue, do you believe that whatever comes out of this meeting will sort of stop Iran from being able to continue with these present actions?\xc2\xa0 Will there be a change?\xc2\xa0 It seems like they\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for the last few months.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that the agreement will lead to a change in that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, the United States is committed to addressing concerning behavior in the maritime space.\xc2\xa0 So we, ourselves, will be focused on that challenge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, yes, I think over time, as our partners in the region develop greater capacity, there will be less of an opening for dangerous or escalatory maritime events -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s emitting from Iran or from anybody else.\xc2\xa0 And you could see terrorist groups seeking to operate in what is a very busy space for the global economy in terms of tanker traffic, so we do want an outcome of this summit to be GCC partners having the capacity to provide for their own maritime defenses, and then also contributing to a more stable maritime space, along with us and other countries, in a part of the world that is not just facing internal conflicts, but also is crucial to the global economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Syria?\xc2\xa0 To what extent is this sort of emerging Gulf alliance -- how much is that going to play in conversations today?\xc2\xa0 Has there been or will there be any discussion about a no-fly zone?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Syria I think will certainly be on the agenda later today.\xc2\xa0 We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that both the GCC countries and the United States are on the same page in terms of our support for the opposition.\xc2\xa0 In the past, at times, you\'ve seen divergent strategies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, look, one of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on for the last year or two has been making sure that we\'re coordinated with the GCC in the provision of assistance to the opposition, both in terms of lethal assistance through the train-and-equip program, but also nonlethal and political support.\xc2\xa0 So I think there will be a discussion of what is the current state of the conflict in Syria, the status of the opposition, the coordination of our work with the opposition.</p>\n<p>And with respect to a no-fly zone, that has not been a substantial topic of discussion in the run-up to the summit itself, so I can\'t -- it may come up.\xc2\xa0 Some of these countries have obviously favored aggressive action against the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 All of them are supporting our efforts, and some militarily, inside of Syria against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But I think as a baseline, we want to make sure that in the provision of assistance to the opposition that we\'re working together.</p>\n<p>And this is an area where, for instance, Mohammed bin Nayef has been a leading figure for the Saudis, even dating back to before his taking on the role of Deputy and now currently Crown Prince.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And from the way you frame the agenda, it sounds like a no-fly zone is not going to be a topic with the U.S. as a priority in addressing --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On this question -- which comes up with Turkey, frankly, more frequently than our Gulf partners even -- look, we\xe2\x80\x99ve said we are open to evaluating different options inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 But we have not seen a no-fly zone as being a viable option that can contribute to essentially changing decisively the situation on the ground given the nature of the fighting that\'s taking place in urban areas and across the country.</p>\n<p>But we have had ongoing discussions, and if our partners have ideas, we always hear them out and we\'re always looking at what are additional steps that we could take to support a more table outcome in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Yemen -- that will be part of the discussions I would assume.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling from people that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to leading up to the summit that some of these countries -- the Saudis, in particular -- feel as though the United States encourages them to take the lead in a regional coalition, and then does some sort of backseat-driving when things don\'t go -- doesn\'t match the goals or perhaps even the methods that you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see happen -- as is happening in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 Now, you\'ve pushed them for a pause in the fighting in the air campaign there.\xc2\xa0 How much friction is there in that aspect of the relationship?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And secondly, on the Iran sanctions, hundreds of billions of dollars presumably when the sanctions are lifted will be available to Iran to create some of the mischief and destabilizing actions that many of these nations are worried about.\xc2\xa0 How do you counter that argument?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, to take your second question first, the fact of the matter is that Iran has been under these sanctions over the course of the last several years, during which time they\xe2\x80\x99ve been carrying out these actions.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions have not prevented Iran from engaging in destabilizing activities across the region that are, frankly, very low cost because often they\'re asymmetric types of capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s also clear is that Iran has been able to find the funding for both its nuclear program and for some of its activities in the region, even under this pressure of sanctions.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is, yes, they will be able to access substantial amounts of revenue over the lifetime of a deal with sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 We believe that it is far more likely that that money is going to be invested in the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0 Given the size of the hole they\'re in, given the budgetary commitments that their government needs to fill, and given, frankly, President Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s linkage of sanctions relief with the improvement of the Iranian economy, we believe, again, what we would expect to see is a prioritization of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s economic situation with respect to sanctions relief.</p>\n<p>That doesn\'t mean that there won\xe2\x80\x99t be some revenue that is used for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s security purposes.\xc2\xa0 But the point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made is that the sanctions have not been a deterrent on those activities.\xc2\xa0 The sanctions have been able to pressure the Iranians to come to the table on the nuclear issue because of how their economy has suffered.\xc2\xa0 So what we need are strategies that are better able to deal with destabilizing actions in the region. Sanctions alone are not a panacea.\xc2\xa0 If they were, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the destabilizing actions that are taking place in the region.</p>\n<p>Your first question on Yemen, we have supported the Saudi-led effort.\xc2\xa0 I think, frankly, the comments from the leaders here has been complimentary in terms of the support the United States has provided, which has been essential in terms of contributing to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been aiming to do with their air campaign.</p>\n<p>I think the two things that we also recognize are, number one, there\xe2\x80\x99s a grave humanitarian situation inside of Yemen, and this pause is essential to facilitate humanitarian access and assistance reaching populations that are in very dire circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And the Saudis have stepped up in terms of providing significant amounts of humanitarian assistance in that context.\xc2\xa0 So I think we have a shared view that there needed to be a pause and a ceasefire that allows for that type of humanitarian delivery.</p>\n<p>And secondly, I think Saudi Arabia and the other GCC countries have been clear since this began that they didn\'t think there was a military solution inside of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 What they want is a political process that can get underway and restore the legitimacy and stability of the Yemeni government.\xc2\xa0 And that process is going to be ongoing both with meetings in Riyadh and efforts through the U.N. going forward.</p>\n<p>And so the U.S. I think is in a common view that there has been a challenge to the legitimate, elected government of Yemen from the Houthi rebels, that there needs to be a political solution that restores the legitimacy and stability of that government, but that there also needs to be this window for humanitarian access.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Another aspect, as you said, Ben, of this summit is the matter of countering ISIL, countering ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Did you receive any firm commitments from the representatives of the countries that are here at the GCC as it relates to that particular issue?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So that will be a focus this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that these countries have contributed to the coalition, and a number of them have taken airstrikes, which is very unique.\xc2\xa0 In all the discussion about whether or not there are differences between the U.S. and some of our GCC partners, we are engaged in an unprecedented, coordinated air campaign against a terrorist organization inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the discussions will focus on the status of that campaign.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on what additional capabilities our partners need in the counterterrorism space, and that could include things like special operations.\xc2\xa0 That could include things like developing better intelligence capabilities.\xc2\xa0 It will also include counter-messaging.\xc2\xa0 And a number of these countries are very committed to countering ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s ideology, its presence in the online and social media space.\xc2\xa0 So I think we will be discussing both the state of the campaign, but also how can we be developing capabilities to deal with the ISIL threat in the long term.</p>\n<p>And then, lastly, on the regional context, if we\'re talking about Syria and Iraq and Libya, clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s an overlap with what we\'re trying to accomplish in ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We want to arrive at common views of the situations in those countries, and that will ultimately contribute to our effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has there ever been -- particularly here -- has there been an ask on the U.S.\xe2\x80\x99s part in terms of getting these GCC countries to put their own troops on the ground, their own boots on the ground to fight ISIS and take the fight to them directly?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We have not.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Iraq, that would clearly not be welcomed by the Iraqi government.\xc2\xa0 With respect to Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a phase of this campaign that has focused on degrading the ISIL safe haven from the air.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, there have been asks on the train-and-equip side, with respect to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of a ground force, our asks have very much focused on the train-and-equip side.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There have been asks in other areas where we\'re getting better cooperation, on things like stemming the flow of foreign fighters into the countries, working with us to counter financing for ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And since September, when we initiated our joint military operation and also addressed this at the U.N., we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen steady improvements in those areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 Ben, first a philosophical question to you, and then I\'ll ask you about some specific comments.\xc2\xa0 Philosophically speaking, many of the GCC countries have been looking for a NATO-style defense pact, something in writing, something binding.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m curious if there is a hesitation on behalf of the United States to enter into that kind of agreement. What\xe2\x80\x99s behind that philosophic?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that, first of all, we are not initiating treaties, mutual defense treaties with our GCC partners.\xc2\xa0 The interests in that type of arrangement I will tell you has not been uniform across the GCC, but there has been some interest in it.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a very complicated piece of business.\xc2\xa0 That is the type of thing -- when you look at our NATO alliance, for instance, it is a painstaking and very extensive process to integrate into NATO.\xc2\xa0 It involves having a shared commitment to a set of capabilities, a shared commitment in terms of an alliance across a range of issues that go beyond even just hard security.</p>\n<p>The same is true in Asia.\xc2\xa0 I think we also would say this is a very unpredictable region in which threats emanate from many different places.\xc2\xa0 What we are prepared to do is say if there is an external threat to your security we stand ready to defend you against that threat or to help you deter that threat.\xc2\xa0 The President will be speaking to this -- the joint statement will be speaking concretely to the nature of our security issues, which we\'ve backed up in the past.\xc2\xa0 We backed it up in the Gulf war; we backed it up by having over 30,000 troops stationed in that part of the world, having the 5th Fleet there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, philosophically, I think a mutual defense treaty is an entirely different type of arrangement with a country and it\'s one that would take far more time to develop than the lead-up to the summit, and frankly, would depend upon a meeting of the minds on a host of issues.\xc2\xa0 I think what we feel is most appropriate here is saying very clearly before the entire world that we\'re committed to the defense of these countries, which is the type of assurance that goes beyond arrangements that we have with many other partners in many other regions, and that that\'s the appropriate way of addressing the assurance issue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the second question I have -- and I\'m going to steal a line from Josh, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll pardon me -- I\'m not asking you to negotiate from the podium, but I do want to ask you about a comment made by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s U.N. ambassador, Vitaly Churkin.\xc2\xa0 He told Bloomberg News that there would be no such provision as in an automatic snapback in place as a part of any Iran nuclear arms deal.\xc2\xa0 Your reaction to those comments?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not true.\xc2\xa0 The framework that was agreed to at Lausanne is very clear in indicating that if there is a breach of the agreement we will have the capacity to snap sanctions back into place.</p>\n<p>With respect to our own sanctions, that\'s very simple because the President will be providing sanctions relief through the use of waivers that are in the legislation, and if the Iranians are in violation of the agreement, we can easily turn off the provision of that relief and all the sanctions are in place because the legislation will still be intact.</p>\n<p>With respect to the U.N. Security Council sanctions, what we\'re currently negotiating is, what is the mechanism to replace the existing U.N. Security Council resolutions with a new U.N. Security Council product that does obviously provide relief from nuclear-related sanctions, but that also preserves some sanctions that we believe are critically important, including in the non-nuclear space -- on issues like sensitive technologies and certain types of arms -- but also allows for there to be a mechanism to re-impose sanctions if the Iranians are in violation.</p>\n<p>So, again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the specific comment from Ambassador Churkin.\xc2\xa0 There may have been more context to it.\xc2\xa0 But on the narrow question of whether or not the deal will include snapback, that has always been the basic premise of our approach to sanctions relief and that was clearly the nature of the understanding that was reached in Lausanne.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Distraction, or just kind of a pain?\xc2\xa0 Or do you just kind of blow it off, a statement like that?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, more interpretation has been offered about the Iran deal than just about anything that I\'ve worked on here.\xc2\xa0 Look, we have a framework; now we\'re into the guts of negotiating the text.\xc2\xa0 That will be ongoing.\xc2\xa0 If we get a deal, everybody can look at it at the end of June.\xc2\xa0 If we don\'t get a deal, it won\'t be an issue.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how we view it.\xc2\xa0 And again, people will -- I think different countries will emphasize different elements and deemphasize other elements.\xc2\xa0 That\'s natural.\xc2\xa0 But what matters is whether or not we get the deal that we need by the end of June.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- about the President and Secretary Kerry, you said today, at the Iran discussion.\xc2\xa0 What do individual members of the GCC delegation say in return?\xc2\xa0 Did any one of them say, we agree that a diplomatic approach is the best way to approach it, and if you can get a tight deal that is best for security in the region? Can you give us anything specific that any of them said in the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t like to speak for other leaders.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t want to kind of get into what each individual said in the discussions.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is, yes, there have been indications that they understand that a verifiable diplomatic agreement as we\'re negotiating with Iran could address the concerns on the nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>To be fair, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also made very clear that their concerns go much broader than the nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 So if I were to characterize the tenor of their comments, they\xe2\x80\x99re focused largely on not so much just the details of the nuclear agreement, but what does it mean for other Iranian actions; this question of what does it mean in terms of sanctions relief.\xc2\xa0 And so the discussion leads naturally to those other areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d characterize it as there is a degree of I think reassurances as it relates to what\xe2\x80\x99s in the nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 I think the greater degree of concern is about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other activities in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did they have specific asks on that other than the sort of security kind of umbrella?\xc2\xa0 Things like counterterrorism, like cyber, like maritime?\xc2\xa0 Did they have things that they wanted the White House, the President to do countering Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing actions in the regions that the U.S. isn\xe2\x80\x99t already doing?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, they did, actually.\xc2\xa0 And I was struck by -- and this has been a lead-in to this process -- but I was struck by the fact that they are thinking in quite practical terms about what types of -- in addition to kind of broad assurances and cooperation, to what types of capabilities they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on -- which relates to Iran, but also, frankly, relates to ISIL.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d say is there\xe2\x80\x99s a recognition that the threats are increasingly asymmetric in the region, whether they see that emanating from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities or from terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>And so, traditionally, for instance, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a lot of focus on what airplanes we\xe2\x80\x99re providing through military sales -- F-16s.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to defeat asymmetric threats just with F-16s.\xc2\xa0 They can play a role, but you\xe2\x80\x99re going to need all these other types of capabilities that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.</p>\n<p>And I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that that understanding has sunk in and the GCC countries have arrived at that on their own.\xc2\xa0 And that, I think, provides the opening for the type of cooperation we want to see coming out of the summit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- might be some questions about Kuwait.\xc2\xa0 And yet is this a summit to restore trust?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing very clearly from the outside that they totally -- and I say totally -- lost trust in this administration.\xc2\xa0 Is this a summit to restore that trust? And then, what are the details?\xc2\xa0 Also, how can the President convince the skeptical countries about the Iran intentions and activities in the area?\xc2\xa0 What kind of arguments that he\xe2\x80\x99s putting forward?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, on the trust issue, all we can do is be very clear about our intentions.\xc2\xa0 And people may agree or disagree with certain policies, but we want to make clear that this is where we stand, this what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and this is why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it.\xc2\xa0 And I think being able to be candid and up front with partners like this does contribute to trust -- certainly from the perspective of seeing where the President is at on these issues and where he\xe2\x80\x99s headed, and how we believe our approaches are consistent with our shared security concerns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So our approach on the Iran deal we fundamentally believe would contribute to regional security.\xc2\xa0 Some people may not agree with that premise, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lay out our rationale and why the alternative of a nuclear deal that does have this type of limitation on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program and is verifiable for 25 years is preferable to the alternatives.</p>\n<p>The second thing I\xe2\x80\x99d say, though, is it\'s also about concrete areas of cooperation.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not just words and debates about developments in the region.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to find people who agree on every development in the region in any case.\xc2\xa0 It\'s about how do we work together?\xc2\xa0 What are our militaries doing together?\xc2\xa0 Where are our military sales going to focus on?\xc2\xa0 What types of joint exercises are we going to do?\xc2\xa0 What is the strategy going forward in Yemen?\xc2\xa0 So we would like it to lead to a very practical cooperation with the GCC countries going forward.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then what of their capabilities?\xc2\xa0 This is the first time we heard this from Washington.\xc2\xa0 The GCC is now -- will be GCC to take over some military action --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99d say is, look, we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to the region.\xc2\xa0 We have a huge security presence in the region.\xc2\xa0 I think you see a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the GCC take on more itself in terms of what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at in Yemen, in terms of the participation of GCC partners in the counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 So you already see the GCC moving into operating as a coalition in certain cases.</p>\n<p>We also fundamentally believe that if the GCC is more interoperable in terms of their military capabilities, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more effective.\xc2\xa0 One area, for instance, is ballistic missile defense, where we see different countries having individuals systems, while if you integrate that system it\'s a more effective system.\xc2\xa0 And the same would be true in many of these other areas.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we recognize that these are independent countries who are going to have, in some respects, independent -- in many respects -- independent foreign policies.\xc2\xa0 But coordination and interoperability among themselves and with us would contribute to the regional security picture.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the Saudis and other GCC countries, in connection with these meetings, are they expressing an interest in going forward with more peaceful domestic nuclear activity?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that has -- for instance, you\xe2\x80\x99d sign off or --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, that issue has not come up at all.\xc2\xa0 So none of these countries have indicated to us some interest in changing their domestic nuclear energy picture, or have raised it at the summit.\xc2\xa0 So I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been speculation about this, but, frankly, we have not received any signal from these countries that that\xe2\x80\x99s a direction they want to move in.</p>\n<p>With respect to Saudi Arabia and the story that you may be referencing this morning, the individual quoted in that story is not a current government official.\xc2\xa0 So in our interactions with the government, we have not had an indication that they\xe2\x80\x99re moving in that direction.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, the focus is much more on the Iran deal and the specifics of that deal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on the human rights question.\xc2\xa0 You said that the issue was raised, but has it ever gone beyond that?\xc2\xa0 Has it ever gone to the point of suggesting to them that certain things, certain weapons programs, et cetera, might be tied to improving and increasing democratic forms or rights for women, et cetera?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have not -- to be I think as specific as I can, we have not leveraged our security cooperation to try to force a change in terms of the political systems inside of these countries.\xc2\xa0 When there have been situations that concerned us, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been willing to look at limiting or pausing the provision of certain assistance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, for instance, in Bahrain, when we had concerns about human rights violations in the context of the protests that took place in 2011-2012, we put a hold on the provision of some of our security assistance that we believe would have potentially been utilized in those activities.\xc2\xa0 So we have sent a clear message to include withholding certain types of assistance when we see actions that we object to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think, again, applying that type of pressure, frankly, generally in these relationships, it\'s not clear to us that that would lead these countries to embrace different political systems.\xc2\xa0 They clearly have a different view of how to organize their society.</p>\n<p>What we have said, repeatedly, is there are issues that we care deeply about that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to discuss.\xc2\xa0 Whether that\xe2\x80\x99s freedom to assemble, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s the rights of women and minorities inside of countries, we speak up for those things everywhere and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering, is the U.S. government prepared to -- or going to offer all the GCC states major and non-NATO ally status?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re open to discussions on that topic -- some of them have that status already, and so I think we\xe2\x80\x99re open to a discussion in that area.\xc2\xa0 I think, frankly, they have been more interested in the nature of the type of public assurance that we can provide with respect to their security and the nature of the capabilities that we can help them to develop.\xc2\xa0 So that has not been the area of particular or focus for them in the run-up to the summit, but it\'s something we\xe2\x80\x99d be open to discussing with them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you brought it up?\xc2\xa0 I mean, have you offered it to them today?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s come up in the discussions as one potential area of increased cooperation.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think more of the focus has led to what is the nature of the public assurance that we can offer -- that we will hear today in our joint statement -- and then, what is the nature of the capabilities we can provide.\xc2\xa0 And this may be a topic that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to explore with them going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that the Lausanne framework is clear when it comes to violations by Iran of the agreement.\xc2\xa0 But the White House factsheet that you released mentions -- and I forget the exact word -- I think it\'s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial violation.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Will the deal be clear on what substantial actually means?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one.\xc2\xa0 And then, two, you mentioned that the Gulf countries matching whatever Iran is allowed to retain has not come up.\xc2\xa0 What would be wrong with that?\xc2\xa0 If the deal maintains that everything Iran has is exclusively peaceful, if everything is verifiably peaceful, why can\xe2\x80\x99t they match everything in the deal?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, on the first question, part of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to identify in terms of what constitutes a breach is the mechanism for determining that there\xe2\x80\x99s a breach.\xc2\xa0 Under the Joint Plan of Action, which has obviously been a bit of a test in how to pursue these issues in other areas, there is a joint commission that can make those types of determinations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The IAEA\xe2\x80\x99s views are obviously fundamentally important to that determination because, frankly, in any type of complex inspections regime, there are very minor and inadvertent violations -- like somebody could be a half an hour later to letting someone in a gate -- that you determine is not a material breach but has another explanation.\xc2\xa0 Or there is a clear violation which is the Iranians are not permitting access to a site that they need to permit access to, or they are using centrifuges in a way that was not part of the deal.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a mechanism established in the final deal to make a determination about what constitutes a violation.</p>\n<p>I think from a practical standpoint, on your second question, it doesn\'t make any sense to say that, because, hypothetically, Iran has X number of centrifuges we\'re going to have that number of centrifuges too, just to have them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not an efficient or effective way to develop a nuclear energy capacity.\xc2\xa0 So from just a practical standpoint, we don\'t think it makes sense.\xc2\xa0 But from a security standpoint, I think if the perception was that everybody was preparing to develop a domestic infrastructure as a hedge to be able at some point to pursue a nuclear weapon, that would not contribute to stability in the region.\xc2\xa0 So I think from a security standpoint, we think that it would likely add and contribute to tensions.</p>\n<p>The fact is, again, there are established ways of developing nuclear energy through -- look, if any country wants to develop the access to nuclear energy through existing international agreements in line with international law, that\'s their right.\xc2\xa0 But the point is what Iran did is the opposite.\xc2\xa0 They went outside of those mechanisms.\xc2\xa0 They developed these capabilities covertly.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the model to follow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some sense of how the Gulf leaders took the message that President Obama gave regarding the assurances on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program?\xc2\xa0 How did they receive it?\xc2\xa0 Did they seem like they were getting those assurances?\xc2\xa0 Or do they have more questions regarding their concerns?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, there was a detailed briefing that Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz gave their foreign ministers in Paris, and so they had a pretty good understanding coming in about the details of the nuclear deal.</p>\n<p>However, not everybody was in that meeting in Paris -- Margaret may have been.\xc2\xa0 But we wanted to make sure that all of the leaders could hear from the President, Secretary Kerry, Jack Lew, kind of the reaffirmation of the key details.\xc2\xa0 And I think they\'re well received.\xc2\xa0 I think people have an appreciation that these are very specific and comprehensive inspections and transparency measures; the limitations are real.\xc2\xa0 So I think that there is a better appreciation for what\xe2\x80\x99s in the deal itself.</p>\n<p>Again, where they expressed concern is on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other behavior and whether or not the sanctions relief could contribute to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s actions, as we discussed earlier.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what happens if and when the Yemen cease-fire ends? I mean, it seems at the moment to be shaky at best and any concrete plan for talks doesn\'t involve the Houthis.</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We would like -- what we would like to see is this window, though, provide an opportunity to initiate those political discussions and take advantage of this period of calm. So our preference is to see the humanitarian pause and cease-fire remain in place to see political discussion gain traction.</p>\n<p>If they don\'t, I think we certainly understand the need for Saudi Arabia to defend its border and to work with the coalition on behalf of stability inside of Yemen.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99d want to make sure that every action that\'s being taken keeps in mind the ultimate necessity of a political resolution rather than a military one.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the Saudis and the other coalition members understand and appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 They don\'t have a desire for a protracted military conflict either.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think the immediate aim is to test whether a political track can gain traction during this pause.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re thinking of something more than five days, then, right?\xc2\xa0 It will have to be rolled over in order for you to know whether that\'s going to --</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 You would.\xc2\xa0 You would.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think the determination will be made at the end of this window, but I think even now there are efforts being made by the Saudis and others to test whether a political track can take hold in this period.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you going to take some domestic questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not going to take any domestic questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been standing up here for an hour waiting to take those.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is about Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 Did you discuss, or are you going to discuss the possibility of expanding, for example, the train-and-equip program, like providing them with some kind of weaponry request, such as anti-aircraft guns or expanding the training program?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that the support to the opposition, including the train-and-equip program, will be discussed later today.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing the nature of our strategy and our coordination mechanism.</p>\n<p>I would anticipate -- I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say for certain, but a frequent topic of discussion is what type of training, what types of weapons will be provided.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that these leaders will get too down into the weeds of specific weapons systems, though.\xc2\xa0 So I think it will be more a strategic direction about where we want to go with the train-and-equip program; what the situation is in Syria, where, frankly, the Assad regime has suffered some losses recently; and also, frankly, what is our approach to the political negotiations with respect to a transition in Syria.</p>\n<p>So I think it will be at that more strategic level rather than the leaders themselves adjudicating between different weapons system.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I ask one breaking news question?\xc2\xa0 Apparently, since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this room, there was --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You know I have a problem when you do that, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Arctic drilling.\xc2\xa0 Arctic drilling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Please.\xc2\xa0 There was a White House lockdown that was imposed and lifted since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this room.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you were aware of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is a quick response, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it had to do reportedly with a man who was piloting a drone near the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I was aware of this issue right before we walked in.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Secret Service, and they can give you a more fulsome account of what exactly has happened and now apparently been resolved over the course of the last hour.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\'s been resolved.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just that the lockdown was lifted.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to speak to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I was just wondering -- the two times we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the President, can you differentiate what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So the President will have an opportunity at the conclusion of the third working session to make a brief statement, standing alongside the other leaders who are participating in the discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>From there, the other leaders will depart, and then the President will give a more full, formal statement in front of the cabin where they convened the meetings today.\xc2\xa0 At the conclusion of that formal statement, the President will take a couple of questions from all of you.\xc2\xa0 As if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken enough questions already today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the Gulf leaders -- will any of them take questions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what their plans are today, but you should ask the individual delegations.\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that they are at least willing -- or planning to make public statements.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to each of the delegations for the plans that they have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not with the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And that would not be part of our standard practice for them to do so.\xc2\xa0 It would be a little cumbersome to have seven world leaders standing there taking questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We heard that there might be one leader with the President making that statement at 4 o\xe2\x80\x99clock or so.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that one of the leaders may also speak alongside the President.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s still being worked out, but that is a possibility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s pool only right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is pool only.\xc2\xa0 Those will be very brief statements.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get your expectations too high. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking just a couple of minutes while they\xe2\x80\x99re all standing there.\xc2\xa0 The President will deliver a more formal, longer statement in advance of taking a couple of questions.\xc2\xa0 And that will be after the other leaders have already departed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s all going to be up there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And that would all be up there.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement pool only?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 For the final statement where he\xe2\x80\x99ll take questions, that will be open to the entire press corps that\xe2\x80\x99s attending here.\xc2\xa0 I think it will be pooled for cameras, but everyone else will be invited to attend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President pleased with what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the Senate now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the indications were positive and we were pleased to see that they apparently reached an agreement. But since we\xe2\x80\x99ve been standing up here, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard if they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually taken that vote that was planned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s still going to sign it?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s still -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought he was referring to --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think he was talking about the trade legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Iran bill, there\xe2\x80\x99s an expectation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get out of the House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what if that\xe2\x80\x99s planned for today --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- in a place where the Senate version is passed by the House that reflects the bipartisan compromise that was reached in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and that would be something the President would sign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the details coming out of there -- talking about a paper communique style?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We will have a written document at the conclusion of the meetings that will detail more of the commitments that were made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separate and apart from whatever statement he makes with one more of the leaders?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lots of information to be aware of today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what time should we see that, the written?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would assume that would be at the conclusion of the third working session.\xc2\xa0 So probably around 4:00 p.m., but we\xe2\x80\x99ll expedite that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get that out as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect a specific (inaudible) of the Israeli government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay for another hour?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stay for another hour.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThank you, guys.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:25 P.M.
