Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t12:13 P.M. EST</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. \xc2\xa0Thank you for being here. \xc2\xa0I appreciate you going easy on my colleague, Josh, yesterday. \xc2\xa0I had to be a chaperone at a 3rd-grade field trip. \xc2\xa0It was pretty great -- Claude Moore Colonial Farm, if you haven\'t been, in Virginia -- very special place.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tI have no announcements except for that at the top. \xc2\xa0So I\'ll go to the Associated Press.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a spokesman for the Afghan President who said today that the only deadline that matters with regard to the security agreement is the one that Karzai wants, which is he wants to get it signed next year when his successor is in office. \xc2\xa0The U.S. position is that it needs to be signed by the end of the year. \xc2\xa0So --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me say a couple things. \xc2\xa0One, we have long made clear that we need to get a bilateral security agreement done this year. \xc2\xa0We\'ve made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative that we do it as soon as possible, and further delay is not practical, nor tenable. \xc2\xa0The United States needs adequate time to plan a potential military mission with our NATO allies, and the Afghans have an election coming up and have said that they want certainty about whether the U.S. will be there to support them post-2014, both financially and with respect to training their security forces.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo this process has been undertaken now for some time, and the bottom line is that we need to conclude the agreement with signature between our two governments as quickly as possible, and certainly by the end of this year. \xc2\xa0Failure to conclude the BSA by that point would make it impossible for the United States and our allies to plan for a presence post-2014. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd what we would say to the loya jirga is that we have negotiated in good faith, we\'ve provided the assurances that President Karzai has sought, and we believe the text before the loya jirga represents a strong agreement for both parties. \xc2\xa0We have submitted our final offer on the text and we hope the jirga will not be left to think that we are open to rewriting it. \xc2\xa0It is time to get this done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the rift or the disagreement over when it should be signed, does that not sort of increase the prospects of a complete U.S. withdrawal of U.S. troops after 2014?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear that the BSA -- the bilateral security agreement -- does not specify troop presence or duration of any presence beyond 2014 of U.S. or NATO troops. \xc2\xa0The President will be making that decision. \xc2\xa0But we have said that a BSA must be in place because we can\'t possibly have a further U.S. military presence there without an agreement in place. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that this has been a prolonged and fully consultative process with the Afghan government, and we look forward to an agreement that can be signed by both sides. \xc2\xa0We need it done by the end of the year because we can\'t push it into next year and be expected to plan for a post-2014 military presence.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on another issue, do you have any information on this 85-year-old American who is said to be detained in North Korea?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I do not believe I have that. \xc2\xa0I\'ll have to take that question and get back to you.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSteve.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, the negotiators are in Geneva talking to Iran. \xc2\xa0What is holding up the interim bill that most seem to -- that you agree on?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The P5-plus-1 is unified on the offer that has been made to the Iranians and there is a process that continues as we speak in Geneva as these issues are worked on. \xc2\xa0We hope that an agreement can be reached. \xc2\xa0The Iranians decided they were not able to come to an agreement in the previous round, but we remain hopeful that we can reach an agreement with all of our P5-plus-1 allies and the Iranians in Geneva.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThe fact is we\'re not reading out hour by hour or day by day the meetings in Geneva, but we believe that the first round provided progress that indicated that it is at least possible to reach an agreement on this first phase, and an agreement that allows for a verifiable decision by Iran to halt any progress on its nuclear program and to roll back key aspects of it as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed. \xc2\xa0And on the parameters of that agreement, we have all in the P5-plus-1 been in consensus and continue to be.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On health care, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing reports that the administration has decided to delay the 2015 enrollment period. \xc2\xa0Is that true, and what would be the reason for that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0HHS has indicated its intent to shift the 2015 -- if you mean the -- well, there are a couple of things here. \xc2\xa0One is the schedule for the health insurance marketplace by one month. \xc2\xa0This is when the insurers would have to decide on their premiums for 2015 -- if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about December -- this December, right? \xc2\xa0So HHS has indicated its intent to shift the 2015 schedule for the health insurance marketplace by one month so that the health plan application deadline would be in May, and open enrollment would begin on November 15, 2015, and be extended to January 15 -- 2014, rather, and be extended to January 15, 2015. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThe idea of pushing back the 2015 schedule by one month has to do with one thing -- several things. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s good for insurers who take into account enrollment through March when setting their 2015 rates. \xc2\xa0The previous deadline was for the end of April 2014 for applications. \xc2\xa0In other words, if you have an open enrollment period that ends on March 31, 2014, and we expect -- in part because of the problems that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the website -- that there will be substantial numbers of people still enrolling right up into that deadline, this gives them more time to assess the pool of people who are getting insurance through the marketplaces and make decisions about what rates will look like in the coming year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And was this discussed with the insurance companies when they were here last week?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more specific readout on that meeting.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tBrianna.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0CNN obtained documents that contradict Henry Chao\xe2\x80\x99s testimony last week that a key window-shopping tool for healthcare.gov was shelved because it \xe2\x80\x9cfailed miserably.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Experts say that the tool is necessary for an online e-retail experience that Americans have come to expect. \xc2\xa0Does the White House stand by Chao\xe2\x80\x99s testimony?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0As Henry Chao said in sworn testimony, there were numerous defects in the anonymous shopper tool and that was the reason the function was not put into production. \xc2\xa0And as CMS has said, they believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d that is written on the document in question is likely an error because the same document also lists a number of ongoing defects and problems with the tool. \xc2\xa0Additional defects were communicated and discussed in other settings. \xc2\xa0This document reflects one point in time, and that was part of a series of ongoing updates and monitoring. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed a lot the issue with the anonymous shopper tool. \xc2\xa0The fact is data about what the universe of premiums would look like were already available to potential consumers on the marketplaces prior to October 1st, which I think pretty clearly undercuts the assertion that we were trying to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not in a way like the President promised like Kayak or Amazon. \xc2\xa0And also, industry sources say that actually that \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d is correct, that this did test successfully, and that any defects were minor -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through them -- that they were minor enough to be fixed in time for launch day for a tool and that experts say is essential to this experience, more so than Plan Preview or Plan Compare.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is, again, making a breaking-news assertion that the website did not function effectively in October, which I think we\'ve taken on and fully acknowledged and conceded. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not, I\'m talking about part of the website being shelved almost two weeks before launch even though it was working.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I would point you to what CMS --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Working pretty well --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That\'s your anonymous sources saying something; Henry Chao has made clear that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case. \xc2\xa0And there were numerous defects with the site, which I think we\'ve cited. \xc2\xa0And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of funny to assert that we were trying to hide an effective part of healthcare.gov when it turned out so much of healthcare.gov performed so far below optimum standards in October, which is a problem I think we\'ve talked a lot about here, for better or worse.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you stand by his testimony?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We do, yes, absolutely.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you believe that it failed miserably?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, it had multiple defects, and Henry Chao testified --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s different than failing miserably.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We stand by his testimony.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean not being really worked on the website.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Brianna, we stand by his testimony. \xc2\xa0What you\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered here is, again, that the website had problems and in anticipation of some of the problems --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is actually a part that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that many problems. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I get that, but in -- that\'s your claim, not backed up --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Backed up by documents.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Backed up by a document with one word on it that is in error and is contradicted by --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In an email, an internal email from Henry Chao.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And is contradicted by -- right, him asserting the facts -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s contradicted by everything else in that document and everything else that we know about the anonymous shopping tool.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So the tool is really the key to President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s sort of vision that he laid out for the website. \xc2\xa0He said on launch day, just visit healthcare.gov, and there you can compare insurance plans side-by-side, the same way you\xe2\x80\x99d shop for a plane ticket on Kayak or a TV on Amazon. \xc2\xa0That, of course, does not require establishing an account. \xc2\xa0Is the President concerned that to this day really the function that really backs up what he wants the website to do is still not functioning, it\xe2\x80\x99s still shelved; contractors are not working on it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, there is a way to now shop. \xc2\xa0And the tool, itself, is different from what was originally shelved --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s rudimentary and it has two age bands and it\xe2\x80\x99s very inexact.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0But, Brianna, you know there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to shop. \xc2\xa0And again, you\'re getting at the fundamental challenge that we\'ve been dealing with here, which has been not pleasant for any of us and not been pleasing to anybody here, beginning with the President, which is that the healthcare.gov website performed --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why are contractors to this day not working on the tool that will tell people who want to sign up if the medications they use are in the formulary of a certain insurance plan, or if the doctor that they see is in network?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The fact is they can get that information, Brianna. \xc2\xa0What they are --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Without enrolling --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0They can register, they can apply --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They can\'t without going through the registration and enrollment process.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Correct. \xc2\xa0Well, no, they can apply and get the information that they need. \xc2\xa0The fact is, you\'re absolutely right that there are problems with the website, and we have been working 24/7 to improve the website. \xc2\xa0And I think that any fair assessment of the functionality of the website today is that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No one is working on this --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Brianna, may I answer your question?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No one is. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s shelved.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I get that working on the priorities that ensure that more Americans who are interested in reviewing their options and purchasing insurance on healthcare.gov can use that site without --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- are functioning well --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0May I? \xc2\xa0Without --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- are using this tool. \xc2\xa0And the federal exchange is not even trying to get it up and running --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, anybody who uses healthcare.gov to register, apply, and then enroll in insurance gets every bit of information that they need to do that. \xc2\xa0And every day, more and more people are able to apply and enroll online through the federal website. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd our goal is to make that site function more effectively every day so that we can achieve our broader goal here, which is to make sure that the benefits of the Affordable Care Act are available for the millions of Americans who so clearly are interested in having those benefits. \xc2\xa0That\'s the work we\'re about every day. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the optimum website; it\xe2\x80\x99s not about anything except for getting affordable, quality health insurance to the millions of Americans who have so clearly demonstrated that they want it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tJohn.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Now that the barrier of not being able to replace political appointees has been removed -- that is, the filibuster having been changed in the Senate -- should we expect the President to remove any of his political appointees that were part of putting this health care website together?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0John, we\'ve addressed that issue in so many different ways. \xc2\xa0The President wants his team focused on implementing the Affordable Care Act, fixing healthcare.gov, making sure that there are all the other pathways that exist available to as many Americans as possible so that they can get the information they need, make the -- shop for health care and then enroll if they so desire. \xc2\xa0That\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd the action taken by Leader Reid in the Senate is unrelated to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0It is related to the historic obstructionism that Senate Republicans have engaged in, by any metric -- any metric you put forward, including the rather remarkable one that of the 23 D.C. District Court nominees that have been filibustered -- of the 23 in history, 20 of them have been Obama nominees.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo this is a problem that has broad implications for the capacity of any President to fulfill his or her constitutional duty to nominate highly qualified candidates for the judiciary and for the executive branch. \xc2\xa0The fact that Senator Reid took this action -- the President supported him in doing that -- only ensures that the President can continue to make choices about highly qualified nominees and that they can now fulfill their responsibilities on the independent judiciary or in the executive branch.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, then, that the most confident people to do the jobs are on his team, whether they be in this building or at other agencies?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0John, I mean, I have no personnel announcements to make. \xc2\xa0There are obviously a lot of positions that any President fills. \xc2\xa0And the fact of the matter is the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, is focused on fixing the problems that exist with the website, making sure that the other avenues by which Americans can get the information they need and enroll if they desire are working properly and expand it, and making sure that, ultimately, the Affordable Care Act delivers on its promise.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd all of the criticisms, all of the documents that get leaked and different news organizations claim they have an exclusive on, they go to the fundamental point about healthcare.gov not working properly and our efforts to fix it -- A, B. \xc2\xa0What they always neglect -- including the so-called playbook that I think was discovered yesterday among Republicans -- is that the Republicans who criticize it day after day after day have exactly no alternatives, no replacements for the Affordable Care Act and no idea how they would tell the American people if they were to succeed in repealing it what would happen to them if they get health insurance on their parents\xe2\x80\x99 policies, what would happen to them if they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting to get health insurance even though they have a preexisting condition and Republicans got what they wanted. \xc2\xa0They would be out of luck because they have, to this day, never supplied an alternative. \xc2\xa0Their goal is the status quo. \xc2\xa0And anybody who thinks the status quo is satisfactory to the American people are just highly mistaken. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on doing, John.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s a yes, that the most competent people are in place right now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0John, look, the President makes personnel announcements when he is ready to make them. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s focused and he believes his team -- he believes in his team and he is making sure that team is focused on delivering for the American people on health care, on the economy, on jobs, on important matters of foreign policy, as is taking place now in Geneva. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMajor.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This White House has dealt with the twists and turns in Afghan politics many, many times. \xc2\xa0They are not unusual. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re sometimes built into the difficulties of negotiating whatever the United States tries to accomplish with its Afghan partners. \xc2\xa0That being said, is this particular dispute now something that the White House believes is manageable, or that it actually does jeopardize the bilateral security agreement and this whole thing could blow up if this isn\xe2\x80\x99t done and signed by the end of the year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Major, what I would say is that the negotiations over the bilateral security agreement took place over a long period of time. \xc2\xa0Many, many issues were discussed and negotiated and resolved with President Karzai and other Afghan leaders. \xc2\xa0And the text that we have now agreed upon and which is being presented to the loya jirga, we believe it represents a good faith negotiated agreement and it is our final offer.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tIt is our belief that Afghanistan needs to act before the end of the year because it is just untenable, impossible, really, to ask the United States and our allies to plan for a potential post-2014 military presence absent a BSA.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any way you can finesse this, meaning loya jirga approves but it\xe2\x80\x99s not signed, and that signage is something that\xe2\x80\x99s assumed -- or do both those things have to happen?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The point is this has to be agreed to and done essentially by the end of the year. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me if it\xe2\x80\x99s approved and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be signed in the first week of January, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the issue here. \xc2\xa0What cannot happen is --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Springtime?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Right, you have elections in the spring and it is simply untenable to accept the possibility that this would not be agreed upon by then or signed by then because it would prohibit us and our allies from planning anything except for the drawdown -- the 2014 drawdown.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday the Majority Leader announced on the Senate floor that the Senate would be taking up additional sanctions against Iran in December and that he would be supportive of that effort. \xc2\xa0This indicates to me and others following the story that the administration is now, because things have bogged down in Geneva, eager to send Iran a signal that this may be the best deal you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get and the Senate is going to come back here in early December and ramp these sanctions up. \xc2\xa0It seems to be a somewhat coordinated strategy now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made -- obviously the effort that has gotten us to this point includes the building by this administration of the most comprehensive and punitive sets of sanctions that have ever existed. \xc2\xa0So this administration has clearly been very supportive of effective and comprehensive sanctions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tIt is because of that effort and the consensus the President built internationally that we have successfully changed Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s calculus, at least apparently so.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, I understand, but the emphasis has been on hold off, but others agree -- a signal that the Majority Leader is in concert with this White House.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say that I think we need to see what happens in the negotiations with the P5-plus-1, first of all. \xc2\xa0And we are appreciative of the fact that the Senate has decided against taking any actions on sanctions while those negotiations are underway. \xc2\xa0It is our belief that Leader Reid -- or our hope that Leader Reid will continue to give the President and our P5-plus-1 negotiating partners the space they need to pursue these negotiations in the future if necessary. \xc2\xa0As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\'re not alarmed by the signal that would inevitably be sent by the Senate saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to ramp up sanctions in December in the context of what\xe2\x80\x99s being negotiated right now in Geneva?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I believe that the Senate has not acted while these negotiations are taking place and we will see what happens coming out of Geneva, first of all, and we appreciate that for all the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed -- that we believe Congress ought to basically save for the most effective moment implementation or passage of new sanctions if they\xe2\x80\x99re necessary to try to change or affect Iranian behavior.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tRight now, the sanctions that have been put in place over all these years have had the impact they were designed to have, which is to persuade Tehran to rethink their approach to their international obligations and to at least suggest that they\xe2\x80\x99re interested for the first time in reaching an agreement with the international community that would allow for the verifiable decision by Tehran to give up any ambitions for a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tIt is the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy that Iran must not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon, and it is his view, strongly held, that, as Commander-in-Chief, he has to pursue the possibility that we can resolve that diplomatically. \xc2\xa0Because obviously the use of force, while never taken off the table, is a very serious proposition, A; B, because the best way to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon is if Iran itself decides to give up that pursuit, and decides in a way that ensures to the satisfaction of the international community that it can be verified through all the means that we have discussed when it comes to inspections and the like.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo that\'s what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake here. \xc2\xa0That\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing. If there comes a time when new sanctions would be effective, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, we would welcome that. \xc2\xa0We would think that would be helpful, as it has in the past. \xc2\xa0Congress has been a very important partner over these past several years in building up this sanctions regime to the point where it has been as effective as it has been.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Vice President stopped by the Fast For Families on the National Mall today to offer his support for those who are fasting on behalf of immigration reform. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m curious, does the President have any intention to do that? \xc2\xa0And does he have any thoughts about this particular from of political activism in the context of immigration reform?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I would say that the Vice President is reflecting the views of this White House and the President by visiting, as have other members of the administration. \xc2\xa0It is our strongly held belief that now is the time to act on comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0There is a broad bipartisan consensus in support of comprehensive immigration reform along the lines that the President outlined in his principles several years ago now; along the lines that has already been passed by a substantial majority of the U.S. Senate -- a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate; along the lines that would pass today if John Boehner allowed legislation similar to the Senate bill onto the floor of the House. \xc2\xa0We know it would pass with Democrats and Republicans. All he has to do is bring a vote.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tNow, the Speaker has said that immigration reform is not dead. \xc2\xa0That is a good thing. \xc2\xa0It is a good thing for the country. It is a good thing for the economy. \xc2\xa0And political analysts say that would be a good thing for the Republican Party. \xc2\xa0But they have to act. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate for those who belief strongly, as we do, that this is an absolute priority to express their views and to make it known to members of Congress who are blocking this necessary reform that would be so helpful to our economy and helpful to our security and helpful to our future competitiveness that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to get it done for the country, for their constituents, for the economy.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any plans for the President to do that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no scheduling announcements at this time.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tPhil.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0With the Senate rule changes yesterday, obviously this enables the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees that have already been put forward -- there are more than 200 of them -- to at some point get some votes. \xc2\xa0What is the White House strategy to take advantage of that? \xc2\xa0What could we see happen over the next few weeks and months? \xc2\xa0Are there -- is there going to be a push for even more nominations to be put forward in the Senate? \xc2\xa0I mean, what are you guys planning to do here?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President has simply been fulfilling his responsibility by selecting qualified candidates for a variety of positions in the executive and on the bench, and that will continue to be his approach. \xc2\xa0What Senator Reid did, and the Senate did yesterday was in reaction to historic obstructionism by Senate Republicans. \xc2\xa0It was the reaction to the fact that obstructionism and filibustering and using cloture had become routine for every nominee, no matter how qualified, no matter how little substantive opposition to that nominee. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd the President obviously welcomes that decision, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to change what he does. \xc2\xa0His whole focus is on making sure that there are qualified nominees on the bench getting the work done that needs to be done in our judiciary, and making sure that there are qualified individuals filling senior positions in the executive branch; making sure that, for example, at FHFA -- that should Mr. Watt be confirmed, that that important agency can begin to deliver for the American people when it comes to protecting consumers and responsible homeowners, when it comes to continuing the work of GSE reform.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of bottled-up and pent-up necessary work on behalf of the American people, on behalf of the American economy, that can be done if the Senate is not obstructing nominees to senior positions in the executive branch. \xc2\xa0And that\'s what we want to see. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has always hoped to see. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, he\xe2\x80\x99s been confronted with historic levels of partisan and ideological obstructionism.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAll right? \xc2\xa0Jim.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on the immigration reform, to get some clarity on the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks earlier in the week. \xc2\xa0Did he throw comprehensive immigration reform under the bus by saying that if the House wants to send up five bills to him, it would be okay? \xc2\xa0Will he sign them one at a time?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What the President said reflected -- this week is almost word-for-word what he said to Telemundo on September 17th, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, if Speaker Boehner thinks that procedurally he has to jump through a series of hoops, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to let the House work its will, as long as the bill that ends up on my desk speaks to the central issues that have to be resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThat is what he was saying again earlier this week when he talked about, procedurally, the path in the House might be for them to pass a series of bills that can later be worked into a broader bill that would reflect the comprehensive nature of the work that\'s been done in the Senate and that the President has outlined in his principles.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\'s just --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0There is no -- well, no, nothing has changed in our belief that this has to be comprehensive. \xc2\xa0In the end, this has to be comprehensive. \xc2\xa0And that\'s not -- what he said was entirely consistent with what he and I and others have said about our recognition of how the House may want to approach this. \xc2\xa0Even what he said this week was that all five of those elements have to get done and have to be part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I understand that. \xc2\xa0But what is key here is you\'re saying now -- making it clear that those five bills would have to be, even if they\'re passed singly in the House, would have to be bundled before they got to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk for him to sign.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, how it works mechanically is up to the Congress, to the Senate and the House. \xc2\xa0What the President will not sign is piecemeal legislation that only addresses visas for \xc2\xa0-- that help improve our legal immigration system and allow people to come and stay and work for high-tech companies, for example. \xc2\xa0He won\xe2\x80\x99t only sign a bill that improves our border security as the comprehensive bill does. \xc2\xa0This work has to be done comprehensively because that\'s the way you get all of these issues solved, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the way you get the bang for our economy that comprehensive immigration reform promises.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So here we are days before Thanksgiving, near the end of the year -- what does the White House believe is still doable before the end of this year? \xc2\xa0Is immigration reform, comprehensive, dead this year?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s up to the Speaker of the House. \xc2\xa0As I just said, it would pass tomorrow. \xc2\xa0It would pass this afternoon if the Speaker were to decide to put such a bill on the floor of the House. \xc2\xa0So it can certainly be done this year. \xc2\xa0And a lot of effort and work has gone into getting us to this point. \xc2\xa0So this is not a case of trying to rush something, right? \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would argue that immigration reform is being rushed here. It\xe2\x80\x99s been an item that members of both parties have sought to accomplish for a long time now because of all the benefits we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tI mean, the President really looks at this as part of an overall focus on broader economic issues -- on growing our economy faster and having it create better and better-paying jobs for the middle class under an overall goal of middle-class security. \xc2\xa0So, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past, if Republicans who are concerned about the politics of immigration reform look at its conservative benefits when it comes to making sure employers are accountable, making sure that undocumented workers are given a pathway to citizenship that makes them pay back taxes and get to the back of the line, if they\xe2\x80\x99re interested in enhanced border security, building on the work that has been done already in this administration, they have that opportunity to argue this on those merits -- including the broad economic benefits that American business leaders have spoken about so passionately, and we agree with them on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo there is an opportunity here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to show Americans who are, understandably, frustrated with the seeming inability of Washington to get things done that represent common-sense consensus. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to show the American people that it can happen, that something like this can be done that will help the economy and help build a stronger foundation for further growth in the future. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo we remain optimistic that this is going to happen, and we look to the Speaker of the House to deliver on what he has said, at least occasionally, when it comes to the need to get immigration reform done.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tRoger, then Ed.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Back to the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s action yesterday. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a package of priorities for those nominees that are already up there and awaiting confirmation -- for example, judiciary versus some of the other executive branch appointments?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, I think we work with the Senate all the time on moving our nominees forward, so I would -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything has changed in that. \xc2\xa0And I would point you to the Senate Majority Leader\xe2\x80\x99s office in terms of how he\xe2\x80\x99ll schedule action on nominees.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the White House give them a to-do list?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0I think the President is very careful in nominating what he believes are highly qualified individuals for these positions. \xc2\xa0And one of the pieces of the story that\xe2\x80\x99s being told here is that so many of these nominees who have been held up, including Patricia Millett, who now has been confirmed, have unquestionable credentials for their positions, who are unopposed by anybody on substantive policy grounds or substantive judicial grounds.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo the President will continue to look for the kinds of nominees that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward in the past. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0But no priority list, though?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I think that the President obviously looks forward to having some key positions filled because they\xe2\x80\x99re so important. \xc2\xa0Jeh Johnson needs to get confirmed so that we have --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Jeh Johnson at DHS; Mel Watt at FHFA, and others, for example. \xc2\xa0There are many vacancies in the judiciary and those seats need to be filled.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one other thing -- does this action -- does it help the White House accelerate its nomination process and does it make it easier to find those qualified candidates?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The second question is one you could only speculate about. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the kind of historic levels of obstructionism that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Senate when it comes to the confirmation process has probably been discouraging for a lot of people, highly qualified individuals who want to serve.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of wiped away --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a welcome development that highly qualified individuals won\xe2\x80\x99t be held hostage to that kind of partisan and ideological obstructionism again. \xc2\xa0But the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on, again, finding qualified nominees who want to serve their country in different posts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tEd.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, back on health care. \xc2\xa0If it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to extend the deadline for 2015 enrollment this far in advance, why not extend enrollment for 2014, given the website issues that even some Senate Democrats have said they want to see, that it should go beyond March?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The time period that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here when it comes to enrollment in the next year is much shorter than the six-month enrollment period that was allotted for the initial year. \xc2\xa0As you know, it extends from October 1st to March 31st. And we are working 24/7 to make improvements to the website, to expand the channels that are available -- alternate channels for consumers to find information and purchase health insurance so that everybody who is interested in buying insurance on the marketplaces is able to in time for those enrollment deadlines. \xc2\xa0And we believe we can meet that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But despite that six-month timeframe, there are Democrats like Mark Pryor and others who have said, just as you are saying on nominees, the President said yesterday, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got majority support, they should get a vote. \xc2\xa0You just said on immigration, there\xe2\x80\x99s common-sense consensus -- as you said on something -- there\xe2\x80\x99s common-sense consensus on extending the enrollment deadline for 2014. \xc2\xa0There are Democrats --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the Republicans who want to do that, they really just want to fix ACA?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mark Pryor and the Democrats, do you think they want to destroy the --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think the Democrats want to destroy the law?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not obviously what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mark Pryor and about a dozen Democrats.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about one Democrat where --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No, there\xe2\x80\x99s about a dozen of them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Some Democrats. \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99re saying is, as Democrats who support the ACA would agree, we need to make sure that the law is being implemented and that the enrollment is being improved so that we can deliver on the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s promise. \xc2\xa0We believe that there is time, because of the extensive open enrollment period that is allowed here, to make that happen by March 31st.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two other quick ones. \xc2\xa0On the 2015 date, Republican Chuck Grassley said today -- he charged that you\xe2\x80\x99re extending -- the open enrollment was supposed to start for 2015 in October of 2014, as I recall. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s now going to start in mid-November 2014. He says you\xe2\x80\x99re doing that so that it starts after the midterm elections -- politics.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The fact is we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this because it makes sense for insurers to have as clear a sense of the pool of consumers they gain in the market this year before setting rates for next year. \xc2\xa0And because of the problems in the implementation of the website on healthcare.gov that we\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced that has slowed enrollment in the early stages here, we expect that what was already going to be a back-loaded process is going to be more back-loaded. \xc2\xa0And that would then leave insurers with a lot of data to try to sort through in a very short time. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAnd so because the website has had troubles, we expect more people to enroll later in the first enrollment window, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, which ends March 31st. \xc2\xa0And the insurers will need additional time. \xc2\xa0April doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really give them enough time to do that so we\xe2\x80\x99re extending it a month.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0The Wall Street Journal has a story today about insurers now further cutting doctors\xe2\x80\x99 fees. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s been happening before the ACA, but it\xe2\x80\x99s accelerating. \xc2\xa0And the story talks about fears that this means some health plans will draw fewer doctors. \xc2\xa0And I wonder what impact do you think that will have on the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise to the American people that if you like your doctor, you\xe2\x80\x99ll keep your doctor, period -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think you noted in your question, and I appreciate it, that doctors and insurers make the decisions about who\xe2\x80\x99s in networks. \xc2\xa0That was true before the ACA and it\xe2\x80\x99s true after the ACA, because the ACA builds on the existing private insurance system. \xc2\xa0It has been the case for decades that insurance companies make decisions about the doctors and provider networks and, under the health care law, that continues. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tInsurers have made that decision -- the whole concept of creating networks was an effort by insurers to control costs. \xc2\xa0So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to -- I know Republicans will or other critics will -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard -- it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard in this case to lay a trend that\xe2\x80\x99s been happening for decades on a bill, a law that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Right, acknowledging that trend, but the President made a promise to the American people -- I know Jon Karl asked you this the other day and you mentioned all these caveats, but the President made a firm promise. \xc2\xa0He said -- just like the last promise --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Ed, nothing in the Affordable Care Act prevents you from keeping the doctor that you like. \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re in -- but what we don\xe2\x80\x99t do, what the Affordable Care Act, contrary to a lot of the messaging out there --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, if it changes your plan and the doctor is no longer in that plan --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. \xc2\xa0Contrary to a lot of the rhetoric around this, this is not a government takeover of the health insurance industry. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s quite the opposite. \xc2\xa0It is an expansion of the private insurance industry. \xc2\xa0And in that industry, insurers create networks; they offer levels of plans. \xc2\xa0And if you are, again -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s important to say who we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the 80 percent who already get their insurance like most of us through our employers or through Medicare or Medicaid or the VA. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about the 15 percent of the uninsured who, by the way, don\xe2\x80\x99t get to choose their doctors because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have doctors.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Actually, it can affect employer plans if they\xe2\x80\x99re changing under the ACA now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, no, no -- they\xe2\x80\x99re changing -- those plans have changed -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been long enough and been in enough networks to know that this has been a phenomenon when you have employer-based health care that has been going on for years and years and years. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tWhat is true for everybody -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re back to the 5 percent shopping for insurance in the individual market, on the health care marketplaces that they\xe2\x80\x99ll now have protections they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have in the past. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll have choices they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have in the past, including a range of options when it comes to levels of coverage. \xc2\xa0And it stands to reason that the higher-level plans will have more expansive choices.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo the decision -- going back to the beginning -- about which doctor is in which plan is not a decision dictated by the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0It is, as it has always been, one that is reached between doctors and the insurance companies.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, going back to questions about issues that have been on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, what are the prospects for meaningful gun legislation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We continue to work to do everything we can through administrative action in keeping with the non-legislative portions of the common-sense proposal the President laid out with the Vice President in the beginning of the year to do things that reduce gun violence in America. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tWe were very disappointed -- the President was very disappointed in the action taken by the Senate, against the overwhelming support in states across the country, including very red states, of expanding background checks so that the system was coherent and effective. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThat remains our position. \xc2\xa0And the President is continuing to do everything he can, and the Vice President is continuing to do everything he can to try to move the ball forward on this issue. \xc2\xa0Because as we discussed so often earlier in the year, nothing that the President is proposing infringes in any way on the Second Amendment rights that he supports. \xc2\xa0And that remains the case. \xc2\xa0And we hope that Congress will reconsider, the Senate will reconsider, and act on this very common-sense proposal.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tIn the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on doing what we can, in keeping with the administrative actions announced -- I think there were 23 of them -- as part of the broader plan that the Vice President and President laid out in the beginning of the year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can the people in Newtown, Colorado, Wisconsin, these other places, expect the President to take another active go at this?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think you have not seen the President shy away from his support for this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We haven\'t heard him talk about it lately.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The fact is the President strongly supports common-sense measures to reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0He strongly supports, as overwhelming majorities of the American people do, expansion of the background checks system so that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t giant loopholes in it. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of action that we ought to be able to take, and the President will continue to push for Congress to take.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tIn the meantime, because of the setback he and so many millions of Americans experienced in that effort earlier this year, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work in ways that we can to curb gun violence through other means.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When will the next administrative action be?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no policy or scheduling announcements to make.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tKristin.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, the President ran on a platform certainly in 2008 of trying to bridge the partisan divide. \xc2\xa0A lot of people are looking at the nuclear action from yesterday and saying that that\xe2\x80\x99s only going to increase partisan fighting and bickering. \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t what happened yesterday only undercut what President Obama said he was going to aim to do back in 2008?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think any fair evaluation of what we have seen this year can lead to only one conclusion, which is that we have seen historic obstruction from Republicans. \xc2\xa0And the idea that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen already the height of partisan obstructionism is I think belied by the facts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m not taking issue with the numbers --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No, what the American people expect Washington to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- try to block the President\xe2\x80\x99s --</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, this is -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair that you ask this because the irony of the moral outrage over this that you sometimes hear from Republicans and the sadness they feel is followed up by a promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll do it even worse if and when they have the opportunity. \xc2\xa0So the sanctity of tradition is clearly not one they take all that seriously unless it\xe2\x80\x99s effective for a brief sound bite. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThe tradition was never envisioned that judges that went on to get confirmed 99 to nothing be held up for 100, or 200, or 500 days. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way the system was supposed to work. \xc2\xa0And I think every member of the Senate knows that of both parties. \xc2\xa0So what the American people are telling us day after day, in your surveys and other surveys, is that they want Washington to work. They want an end to the sort of blind partisan bickering and obstructionism, and that is manifested --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This hasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily made Washington work.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0It makes it work when we can get qualified individuals serving in courts that have empty seats. \xc2\xa0It works when we can get somebody like Mel Watt confirmed to an agency that has an important role to play when it comes to empowering and helping responsible homeowners, and reforming the GSEs. \xc2\xa0It helps to get somebody confirmed to the incredibly posts at Homeland Security, both the number-one and number-two posts in that agency. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tA lot of work needs to get done and the American people are just tired of -- look at their reasoning for filibustering highly qualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit Court. \xc2\xa0The same court for which they voted yes on nominees when it had a lower workload than it has today, they\xe2\x80\x99re now claiming that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough workload. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- the hypocrisy is obvious for anyone paying attention.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Trent Lott, who pursued a similar course, said that he ultimately regretted that action. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly too soon to regret anything, but to what extent is the President concerned that this could come back to bite him, to bite Democrats?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The President believes that the American people want Washington to work and to stop these excursions into partisan gamesmanship that prevent Congress and Washington from getting pretty straightforward things done. \xc2\xa0And to the extent that this decision by Senator Reid improves that situation, the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you about Iran and the P5-plus-1 talks. \xc2\xa0You said the P5-plus-1 is unified, and I\xe2\x80\x99m curious because after the last round of negotiations France came out and said the deal is not good enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s not strong enough.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, no, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating reports of things versus what actually happened. \xc2\xa0The fact is that the offer --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Something changed so that France was not onboard with the deal that was coming together at the end of the last round of negotiations.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect. \xc2\xa0The deal that Iran rejected was supported 100 percent by every member of the P5-plus-1. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a fact. \xc2\xa0And it is the deal that we\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating today in Geneva.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They came out and voiced criticism to it, though.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, Kristin, the deal that Iran decided it could not support at that time was one that every member of the P5-plus-1 was unified on and supported, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the deal that we\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating in Geneva today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0One more about State Senator Creigh Deeds. \xc2\xa0He was released from the hospital. \xc2\xa0Does President Obama have any plans to reach out to him? \xc2\xa0Has he yet? \xc2\xa0Does he have anything to say in the wake of, obviously, the tragedy?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on communication like that. \xc2\xa0I would simply say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers, and everybody\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers in this family -- I mean, in this White House are with the Deeds\xe2\x80\x99 family in the wake of that terrible tragedy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tAlexis.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, can I just follow up on your answer to John\xe2\x80\x99s question? \xc2\xa0Are you saying that Secretary Sebelius -- the President expects her to be on the job at least through the end of the March 31 enrollment period? \xc2\xa0Is that what you were suggesting?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no personnel announcements to make. \xc2\xa0You could ask that about every individual that the President appoints in the administration. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you is the President has confidence in Secretary Sebelius and he wants his team -- of which she is an important part -- that\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on implementation of the ACA to focus on implementation of the ACA. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she\xe2\x80\x99s doing. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what all of us who were involved in that effort are doing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he have any reason to believe that she won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the job through the end of the enrollment period in March?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no insight into the personnel decisions that he may or may not make in the future or the individuals who have been serving in this administration may or may not make. \xc2\xa0The fundamental question you\xe2\x80\x99re asking in a variety of ways is does he have confidence in her, and the answer today is the same as it\xe2\x80\x99s been every day: \xc2\xa0yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other question related to this -- usually a President, at the end of the year, going into the New Year, works with the Chief of Staff to think through the team that he has both at the White House and in the Cabinet and do a kind of inventory of that -- who wants to leave, who is leaving. \xc2\xa0Can you describe the process that the President has with the Chief of Staff underway now?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Has any press secretary of any administration ever described that process? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I do not get into personnel decisions.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Actually, they have.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, maybe after the fact, Alexis. \xc2\xa0I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0The fact is, the President, the Chief of Staff, other senior members of his team review and look at personnel decisions all the time. \xc2\xa0And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s, as is the case in any administration, times when people decide they need to leave for a variety of reasons. \xc2\xa0And when that happens, the President and his team evaluate their options when it comes to successors. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s no different at the end of the year than it is midway through the year or at the beginning of the year. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are now. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing unique about the process today compared to earlier this year or last year or any other year that he\xe2\x80\x99s been President.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tCheryl.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0Over the last three days, Senator Baucus has been rolling out a variety of tax reform proposals. \xc2\xa0Has the White House been involved in those proposals, and do you support them?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We are very supportive of Senator Baucus\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with us and his efforts when it comes to reforming our tax code and the corporate tax system. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that we put forward ourselves here earlier and continue to hope that Congress would act on. \xc2\xa0There is an opportunity here to reform our corporate tax code in a way that lowers rates, closes loopholes, makes us more competitive, and provides the opportunity to invest in areas like infrastructure that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support and that would do enormous good for our future economic growth. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThat kind of investment would create jobs right away in important sectors of our economy and would have compounding benefits over the years, because when you rebuild airports and bridges and highways and ports, you are investing in our economic future. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tThe Vice President has been traveling, as you know, to ports around the country, as well as the Panama Canal, to focus attention on the need to make the necessary investments in our ports so that we can be competitive in the 21st century. \xc2\xa0This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re focused very much on. \xc2\xa0And there has been, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, a justifiable amount of focus and attention here in Washington on the problems with the website and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and that is something that we are obviously very engaged in fixing. \xc2\xa0But broadly speaking, this administration is focused on the things we can do to grow our economy, the things we can do to make the middle class more secure, and that includes a deal that is out there, if Congress were to take it, to reform our corporate tax system and make it more fair, close loopholes and invest in infrastructure, invest potentially in universal pre-K or pre-K for all, because of the positive long-term benefits that that would give our country and our economy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tSo these are the issues that the President is primarily focused on. \xc2\xa0And so we obviously commend Chairman Baucus on moving these issues forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one more. \xc2\xa0Voice of America.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wow, two days in row. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Did Josh call on you? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Okay, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on somebody else. \xc2\xa0No, go ahead. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will we be hearing statements from the President and the King of Morocco at this event this afternoon?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there are any statements planned. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a photojournalists spray, I believe, that involves photographers and video.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So can I just follow up on that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will the President be raising human rights issues directly with the King, including issues involving Western Sahara and the broadening of the U.N. mandate to include human rights monitors?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0What I can tell you about that is that the President looks forward to discussing a range of issues of mutual interest with King Mohammed VI, including support for Morocco\xe2\x80\x99s democratic and economic reforms. \xc2\xa0This visit is also an opportunity to increase our cooperation on addressing regional challenges, including countering violent extremism, supporting democratic transitions and promoting economic development in the Middle East and Africa. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tOn the issue of the Western Sahara, our position has remained consistent for many years. \xc2\xa0The U.S. has made clear that Morocco\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy plan is serious, realistic and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the aspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more of a preview on their meeting than that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Week ahead?</div>\n<div>\n\t\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\tMR.
