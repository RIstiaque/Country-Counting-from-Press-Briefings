Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:34 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just want to say that it is my pleasure, and clearly yours, to have with me today the Secretary of Transportation, Ray LaHood, who is here to speak with you about the impacts of sequester, if it comes to pass, on the American travel industry.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a lot, the indiscriminate, deep cuts will affect everyone, really, in America, and industries.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary LaHood is here to discuss one aspect of that with you and to take some questions.\xc2\xa0 And afterwards, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be here to take questions on other issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I just want to remind you that we\xe2\x80\x99re on a slightly constrained time schedule.\xc2\xa0 We have the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with national governors -- Democratic governors, and then also the pool spray with the Prime Minister of Japan.</p>\n<p>With that, I turn it over to Secretary LaHood.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Sequester will be a very -- will have a very serious impact on the transportation services that are critical to the traveling public and to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.\xc2\xa0 At DOT, we will need to cut nearly a billion dollars, which will affect dozens of our programs.\xc2\xa0 Over $600 million of these cuts will need to come from the Federal Aviation Administration, the agency that controls and manages our nation\xe2\x80\x99s skies.</p>\n<p>As a result of these cuts, the vast majority of FAA\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 47,000 employees will be furloughed for approximately one day per pay period until the end of the fiscal year, and in some cases it could be as many as two days.</p>\n<p>Today we are sharing more details with our unions and with industry so they can start planning for serious impacts of sequester.\xc2\xa0 Here is what these automatic cuts are going to mean for the traveling public.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, as always, safety is our top priority, and we will never allow the amount of air travel we can handle safely to take off and land, which means travelers should expect delays.\xc2\xa0 Flights to major cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco and others could experience delays of up to 90 minutes during peak hours because we have fewer controllers on staff.\xc2\xa0 Delays in these major airports will ripple across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Cuts to budgets mean preventative maintenance and quick repair of runway equipment might not be possible, which could lead to more delays.\xc2\xa0 And once airlines see the potential impact of these furloughs, we expect that they will change their schedules and cancel flights.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we are beginning today discussions with our unions to likely close more than 100 air traffic control towers at airports with fewer than 150,000 flight operations per year.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about places like Boca Raton, Florida; Joplin, Missouri; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and San Marcos, Texas.\xc2\xa0 The list of the towers -- the list of potential towers that are to be closed, or elimination of midnight shifts, is posted on our website as I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking now.\xc2\xa0 So you can see the entire list there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re also beginning discussions with unions to eliminate midnight shifts in over 60 towers across the country.\xc2\xa0 The closures will impact services for commercial, general aviation, and military aircraft.\xc2\xa0 This will delay travelers and delay the critical goods and services that communities across the country need.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are harmful cuts with real-world consequences that will cost jobs and hurt our economy.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a solution to avoid these cuts.\xc2\xa0 And as a former member of Congress of 14 years, I urge my former colleagues to address this issue when they get back next Monday, and to work on a long-term, balanced solution to our deficit challenges.</p>\n<p>And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy to answer some questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, these cuts and these cutbacks that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, are these the type of things that the public will start seeing on March 2nd?\xc2\xa0 Or is this going to be a longer rollout?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 We think the rollout will take from March 1st to April 1st, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll begin to see the activity in the layoffs and the delays probably beginning around April 1st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there any other ways to avoid the cuts other than those you have outlined?\xc2\xa0 There are some Republicans who say you could mitigate these effects by doing other things in your budget system.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Look, the sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for moving money around.\xc2\xa0 It just does not.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that we can move money from one pot, say like AIP, which is the Airport Improvement fund -- which in most places has a pretty good chunk of money -- sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, this is very painful for us because it involves our employees, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very painful for the flying public.\xc2\xa0 As a former member of Congress, I heard complaints all the time from my constituents when their flights were delayed or when their flights were cancelled, and this is going to have an enormous impact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you clarify why the flights will be delayed?\xc2\xa0 Is it a matter of mileage between flights?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reduce the number of controllers, which will reduce their ability to guide planes in and out of airports.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So more distance between planes -- landing distance --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to reduce the number of controllers, which will reduce their opportunity to guide the same number of planes that they would ordinarily do at full capacity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about TSA implications?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 TSA is under Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a different lane.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your total budget at DOT is, what, $70-some billion?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 $70 billion, in round numbers, yes -- 55,000 employees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So help the public understand -- a billion dollars cut.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a big budget.\xc2\xa0 Can\xe2\x80\x99t you find some other way to cut that without telling air traffic controllers to stay home?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at every contract, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going -- our lawyers are looking at every contract to see what penalties we would have to pay as we begin to cut or adjust contracts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at everything possible; and everything possible that\xe2\x80\x99s legal, we will do.\xc2\xa0 But this has to be a part of it.\xc2\xa0 DOT has 55,000 employees.\xc2\xa0 The largest number of those employees are at the FAA, and the largest number of those employees are controllers and they\xe2\x80\x99re all over the country.\xc2\xa0 There has to be some impact in order to save a billion dollars.\xc2\xa0 A billion dollars is a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear -- it\xe2\x80\x99s less than 2 percent of your budget.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 And where I come from, which is central Illinois, a billion dollars is a lot of money.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult when you have this kind of -- the number of employees that we have guiding planes in and out of airports to do anything except look at everything, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you just basically throwing out whatever sounds like the most severe consequence in order to ratchet up pressure?\xc2\xa0 And are you having discussions with some of your former colleagues up on the Hill to warn them of what\xe2\x80\x99s coming?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes, we are having discussions with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 We have briefed staff people on the respective committees -- commerce committee in the Senate; T&amp;I committee in the House.\xc2\xa0 And they know the impact and they know why we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this.\xc2\xa0 They know a lot about these numbers we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with because we work with them on a regular basis.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that we\xe2\x80\x99re just doing this to create some kind of a horrific scare tactic is nonsense.\xc2\xa0 We are required to cut a billion dollars, and if more than half of our employees are at the FAA, the FAA -- there has to be some impact.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the reason we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing what we\xe2\x80\x99re announcing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what sort of impact will these delays have on the airline industries and their financials, specifically?\xc2\xa0 Do you have any forecast for what that will do?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the airline industry today -- A4A, which represents all of the airlines, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be probably talking to individual airlines.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re making this announcement today, and obviously we have to work through with them what impact this will have.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to restrict some of the flights that they currently -- are on their books to fly in the next -- within the next 30 days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they be required to compensate passengers for delays?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk to them about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that part of U.S. law that they have to do that?\xc2\xa0 Where does this figure into that?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to talk to the airlines about that.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, have the airlines specifically said they will definitely have to choose --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You know, we just started to talk to the airlines today.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on the phone -- our folks are on the phone with them right now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re on the phone with the airlines, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the phone with our unions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re sending an email to all of our employees so everybody gets the same information at the same time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they have said it\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility this is one of the things that --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s not possible to continue the same schedules with less people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on the issue of safety, how can you guarantee that safety standards will be met if you\xe2\x80\x99re scaling back?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Because that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we do every day.\xc2\xa0 Our people get up every day and think about safety, and we think about it in a way that maybe nobody else thinks about it -- certainly common, ordinary citizens.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many, many times people -- thousands of people today boarded planes, buses, got in their cars, and the thing they didn\'t think about was safety.\xc2\xa0 We do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we will never take a back seat when it comes to safety.\xc2\xa0 We just absolutely will not.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the reason, back to Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s question, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at everything.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not just looking at furlough days.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at every contract.\xc2\xa0 Our lawyers are looking at every contract to see what impact it has for us to try and find some savings in those areas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, why is the alarm being raised now?\xc2\xa0 Why not three, four months ago?\xc2\xa0 Why now?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99re within 30 days of sequester.\xc2\xa0 I mean, sequester really begins March 1st, but we have a 30-day window here to prepare people.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with our colleagues here at the White House and OMB for a number of months on what impact this is going to have.\xc2\xa0 And now is the time to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, at the Airlines for America briefing, the airline lobby actually said that there would be no effect, that they suspected there would be no significant impact on the air travel system.\xc2\xa0 Where is the disconnect between what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying and what the airlines are saying?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think they have the information we\xe2\x80\x99re presenting to them today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what they used for that, Jim.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think when they see the kind of cutbacks that are going to be made at some of these towers, they\'re going to have no choice but to really look at the fact that there are going to be delays, and there are going to have to be some cutbacks on some of these flights.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on safety, if I could.\xc2\xa0 What is going to be the effect on FAA inspectors?\xc2\xa0 Are you also going to furlough some of them that are doing the -- who are reviewing the safety of these planes?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Everything will be impacted in terms of the controllers and contracts.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to our safety programs, there will be no compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And those are things that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at, but we want to make sure that those people that are, for example, doing the work on the 787, doing the work on inspecting planes, no compromise when it comes to safety.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary -- thank you, sir.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, as far as international carriers are concerned, are you in touch with international carriers, if international passengers are going to be affected from this?\xc2\xa0 Because whatever happens in Washington, whole world is affected, people around the globe.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch with all of the airlines.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you said you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking with the unions about this.\xc2\xa0 Are they going along wholeheartedly with your proposal?\xc2\xa0 Or are they --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 We just started our talks today.\xc2\xa0 Our FAA Administrator, Michael Huerta, has been talking to Paul Rinaldi, the head of the controllers union.\xc2\xa0 But the call today will be with the entire leadership of the controller\xe2\x80\x99s union.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned that they could object to the kinds of cuts you are proposing?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, the discussions are beginning now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been bashful about expressing their point of view.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, does this in any way affect Amtrak all that much?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 No, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 No, sir, it does not.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, we went through this rodeo once before two months ago, the last time we came to the sequester deadline.\xc2\xa0 Did any of these conversations happen at the end of December last year with the unions and with the airlines?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Of course.\xc2\xa0 When we thought that there was going to be a sequester, of course we -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in continual discussions with these folks.\xc2\xa0 We have a great partnership with them.\xc2\xa0 And the answer is yes, of course.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, if the sequester goes through and these cuts kick in, how quickly can you turn off the switch and put things back to normal?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Look, all of our planning and all of our discussions and all of our work are about getting to where we\xe2\x80\x99re at today, with this announcement, with our discussions, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where it takes us.\xc2\xa0 And planning for a restart is -- we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a lot of discussion about that at this point.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any requirement under the sequester that once it kicks in it has to last three months or four months or five months?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 No, not that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are you telling Republicans in Congress, Mr. Secretary?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 That this is going to have a huge impact on their constituents.\xc2\xa0 Look, and I can tell you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you break it down politically for them, what are you saying?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 That your phones are going to start ringing off the hook when these people are delayed at airports, and their flights are delayed 90 minutes, or their flights are cancelled, or their air tower is closed.</p>\n<p>Look, you all know I was in Congress 14 years.\xc2\xa0 I represented central Illinois, which included Peoria and Springfield, both with air towers.\xc2\xa0 Any time there was even a threat of a closing of an air tower in Peoria/Springfield, our phones started ringing off the hook from controllers, but also from people who use the airport.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s not only the impact on the passengers, it\xe2\x80\x99s the impact that it has on airports, control towers, people who work there, airports.\xc2\xa0 And their phones are going to start ringing.\xc2\xa0 Why does this have to happen?\xc2\xa0 Nobody likes a delay.\xc2\xa0 Nobody likes waiting in line.\xc2\xa0 None of us do.\xc2\xa0 If we can\'t get our hamburger within five minutes -- if we can\'t get on the plane within 30, 40, 50 minutes after going through, you know what happens.\xc2\xa0 They start calling their member of Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s question, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to scrub everything to make sure the priority is safety and usability, right?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Number one is safety.\xc2\xa0 Always has been, always will be.\xc2\xa0 We never take a back seat when it comes to safety.\xc2\xa0 We will never compromise safety -- ever.\xc2\xa0 Never have and never will.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position that this is a manufactured crisis, one manufactured by your former House colleagues?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I think Republicans need to step up here.\xc2\xa0 I served for 14 years.\xc2\xa0 During those 14 years, I was -- 12 of those years I was in the majority party.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Gingrich was the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 He worked with then-President Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 We balanced the budget five of those fourteen years.\xc2\xa0 It meant that there was compromise.\xc2\xa0 This requires compromise.\xc2\xa0 This requires Republicans stepping forward with some ideas about how to keep essential services of government running at the level that people have been accustomed to.\xc2\xa0 This is not rocket science.\xc2\xa0 This is people coming together the way that other Congresses have done to solve big issues.</p>\n<p>I suggest that my former colleagues on the Republican side go see the movie \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln,\xe2\x80\x9d because in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln,\xe2\x80\x9d it shows how hard it was back then to get things done.\xc2\xa0 But what Lincoln did is he gathered people around him the way that I believe President Obama is doing by calling Republicans, talking to them, trying to work with them.\xc2\xa0 And when that happens, big things get solved.\xc2\xa0 The fiscal cliff got solved because people started talking to one another.\xc2\xa0 So this can happen again.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, have your phones been ringing from members of the public?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what are they saying?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have your phones been ringing from members of the public yet?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 No, but look, this is the announcement today.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a lot of this background work, and so I have no doubt my phones will ring from members of Congress -- why is my control tower being closed?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, where were these warnings two weeks ago, a week ago?\xc2\xa0 I mean, speaking of movie references, this might be called an acting performance, because you are -- you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be scaring the public today.\xc2\xa0 This is going to be scaring the public about their travel plans.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the reaction of the public is.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do is to wake up members of the Congress on the Republican side to the idea that they need to come to the table, offer a proposal so that we don\'t have to have this kind of calamity in the air service in America.</p>\n<p>And we want to get it right, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the last few weeks putting all of this information together so we do have it right.\xc2\xa0 So that we are not just taking a meat axe to one part of FAA, that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the full breadth of the entire agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you said that you want these guys to wake up.\xc2\xa0 Have you awakened them by using a phone?\xc2\xa0 Have you called any Republicans recently?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I just said I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to Republicans and their staff on the T&amp;I committee and on the Senate Commerce --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us who you spoke with and what the nature of those interactions were?\xc2\xa0 And what are they saying to you in terms of their own leadership?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I doubt if you really want a list of the members of Congress I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to, okay?\xc2\xa0 But take --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many?\xc2\xa0 Enumerate.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 A half a dozen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are they telling you about what they think about their own leadership?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t talk to them about their leadership.\xc2\xa0 I talked to them about the impact on air travel and air traffic control towers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was their reaction?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not good.\xc2\xa0 They get it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Republicans would say -- and they have been saying this -- that the Democrats in the Senate should act on two bills that they passed in the summertime.\xc2\xa0 Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you calling the Democrats in the Senate and saying, pick up -- act on the Republican bills and avoid sequester that way?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with that approach?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on trying to figure out how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get to a billion dollars.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, in all the discussion about the sequester, you\xe2\x80\x99re the first Cabinet Secretary that\xe2\x80\x99s been brought into a White House briefing to talk about this for us recently.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, do you and the President think that the impatience of the American people at the airports is the strongest leverage point to press with the Republicans?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I would describe my presence here with one word:\xc2\xa0 Republican.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that maybe I can influence some of the people in my own party.</p>\n<p>Look, this is a big deal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal because a lot of people -- common, ordinary citizens fly.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people use airports.\xc2\xa0 And this is going to have a real impact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Department of Transportation is taking part of this hundred-city tour called the Connecting Your Community to talk about proposals in the President\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 Will you end your participation in that tour as a way to cut some savings right now?\xc2\xa0 Sending DOT employees out to --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was supposed to be in Orlando and South Carolina today, so I guess I have ended it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it not going to happen?\xc2\xa0 Is there going to be a bridge -- Tom Coburn is asking for an explanation of why it\xe2\x80\x99s being held in light of the sequester potential?\xc2\xa0 The hundred-city tour.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask Jay about that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, let\xe2\x80\x99s say -- I\xe2\x80\x99m finally traveling to India in the next two weeks, should I be worried?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be delayed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you\xe2\x80\x99re telling Republicans to come to the table.\xc2\xa0 Are you telling them to raise taxes?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you telling them to --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling them to come to the table and start talking to Democrats about how we solve this.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the solution, just like they figured out the solution on the fiscal cliff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not telling them that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY LAHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I have not told them the specifics about how to solve it.\xc2\xa0 Come together, talk to one another.\xc2\xa0 Figure it out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done things around here.</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend, everybody.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Secretary LaHood with whom it is always a pleasure to share this podium.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I mean that seriously.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be missed by me and everyone else here at the White House.</p>\n<p>If I could just -- in answer to the question in the back, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just go straight to the issue here.\xc2\xa0 The way to avert sequester is to pass a bill that can be agreed to by Democrats and Republicans that either buys down the sequester or, when there was time to do this, that achieves the $4-trillion goal by reducing the deficit further along the lines of the big deal that President Obama and Speaker Boehner were talking about during the fiscal cliff negotiations.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the offer the President made is still on the table -- spending cuts, entitlement savings, and revenues through tax reform.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In this process, if you accept the premise that for Democrats it is hard to go along with spending cuts -- or harder to go along with spending cuts and hard to go along with entitlement savings, that they might prefer to do revenues over that.\xc2\xa0 So the tough sell to Democrats is to go along with spending cuts and entitlement savings, and that the tough sell, as we all know, because we hear it all the time, for Republicans is to go along with revenue increases; and that leadership is represented in part, certainly in the discourse here in Washington, by a willingness by the leaders of one party to convince their members to go along with tough choices.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would then ask you to look at the proposals that we put up, that I had on the screen here yesterday, the offer that we made to Speaker Boehner, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, the President\xe2\x80\x99s submission to the super committee, which was specifically designed to eliminate the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And in every single one, he has put forward balance.\xc2\xa0 He has put forward spending cuts and savings from entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 And as all of you know who have covered Washington, some of that savings is a hard sell to Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But this President has been leading on the issue.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we have not seen any commensurate action by Republican leaders.\xc2\xa0 Their answer always is:\xc2\xa0 spending cuts only, no revenues, entitlement savings only, no revenues, burden borne by seniors or FAA employees or border security guards or children with disabilities, but not the wealthiest, not corporations who enjoy tax breaks, not oil and gas companies who get subsidies.\xc2\xa0 That is always their answer.</p>\n<p>So you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- it is hard to find a compromise solution with a side that says the only available solution from our view is if you come 100 percent to us.\xc2\xa0 And that, unfortunately, has been the narrative that you have been dealing with -- and certainly we have been dealing with -- now for -- really since the beginning of 2011.</p>\n<p>The President supports the proposals that the Senate Democrats have put forward and the House Democrats have put forward that would buy down the sequester and give Congress time to work on a bigger deal to reach that $4-trillion target in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The President has signed into law, as you know, already $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction -- two-thirds of which is comprised of spending cuts and savings from entitlements.\xc2\xa0 So only a third of that has been from revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We want balance.\xc2\xa0 The American public wants balance.\xc2\xa0 There was, I think, a public poll that was published in USA Today -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a representative from that fine newspaper here today\xc2\xa0 -- but yesterday that I think cited 76 percent of the American people support a balanced approach to this challenge.\xc2\xa0 Something like 19 percent supported a \xe2\x80\x9cmy way or the highway\xe2\x80\x9d spending cuts-only approach.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since we\xe2\x80\x99re a week away from the deadline, is it the White House expectation at this point that the sequester will take effect next Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We remain hopeful that Congress will act, that the proposals Democrats have been working on in both Houses will be taken up and passed, that Republicans will -- having heard some of the information about what the impacts will be on real people out there, and the macro impact on the economy -- will come to the conclusion that it is better simply to do what they did in December and allow this manufactured deadline to be postponed so that they can get back to the work of doing what Secretary LaHood was just talking about, which is coming together and finding a reasonable, bipartisan compromise, a balanced compromise, to complete this job of achieving $4 trillion-plus in deficit reduction over 10 years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what are the realistic prospects of that happening over the next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never done very well in Vegas or Atlantic City, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to make odds for you.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are discouraged by the line that Republican leaders have taken, which is that the book is closed on revenue, despite the 76 percent of the American people who believe that balance is the right approach; that the only way to do this is the way they propose, which is not supported, obviously, in the Senate and not supported by the American people, and not supported by the President.</p>\n<p>But we remain hopeful, and we will continue to engage with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to make our case around the country about why we need to avoid the sequester, what the damage of that would be to the economy and to average folks out there who -- some of whom are working today but will not be working 30 days from now if the sequester takes effect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is incredibly important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the broader enterprise here that everyone is engaged in -- those who are elected and sent to Washington -- and that is taking steps to try to improve our economy, help it grow, and help the middle class.\xc2\xa0 This does not help the middle class.\xc2\xa0 It does the opposite.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s bad policy, by design, so we should not let it take place.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you tell us about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message was to the Democratic governors this morning about this subject?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess I was in other meetings so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t present.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President intended to speak with governors about the issues that are of concern to them.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we all know about governors is that the issues that are of concern to them tend to be issues that aren\xe2\x80\x99t broken down by party affiliation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the need for actions to be taken that help job creation, the need for investments in infrastructure; issues involving implementation of the Affordable Care Act, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, immigration reform -- many of the issues that we are discussing here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a readout, that\xe2\x80\x99s just my understanding of what those conversations were likely to look like.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he intending to talk to them about encouraging them to go public with their concerns about the real-world impact of this in their states?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you get elected governor in any state in this country if you are not out there talking about the issues that affect your constituents.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- so I guess my answer to that is I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would have to tell governors of either party to be concerned about it or to communicate with their constituents about it.\xc2\xa0 I expect that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen across the country.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats and Republicans are going to have to explain what implementation of the sequester will mean in terms of job loss, furloughs, reduced economic growth, closure of airport towers, or reduced hours for air traffic controllers at their airport.\xc2\xa0 These are just a handful of the impacts that we would see if the sequester goes into effect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Secretary said sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for moving money around.\xc2\xa0 Is that completely true?\xc2\xa0 Does OMB have any discretion?\xc2\xa0 Do the agencies have any discretion?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember if you were in the chair when I had Danny Werfel here to talk about this from OMB about how the law dictates what must happen in terms of the cuts.\xc2\xa0 And I think Secretary LaHood reflected the -- in layman\xe2\x80\x99s terms -- the facts, which is there is very little flexibility in terms of how to make those cuts happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Within that limited flexibility, Secretary LaHood made clear that he will -- he and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure other Secretaries are doing this -- are doing everything they can to deal with these cuts and absorb them, prepare for them in a way that allows them to achieve their mission.\xc2\xa0 And in the case of the Department of Transportation and the FAA, top priority is safety.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So as he said at the top, that would mean -- because the FAA is such a big chunk of the Department of Transportation and unavoidably would be affected by furloughs -- that you would have only the number of takeoffs and landings that the system could bear with a reduced staff.\xc2\xa0 And that means -- and still maintain the levels of safety that the FAA does.\xc2\xa0 So that means reducing the number of flights, or delaying flights, with all that means for travelers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just referring to the transportation, but broadly, the answer is that the flexibility is very limited?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 And again, I would point you to the briefing that was done I believe last week in which Danny Werfel addressed this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Generally, can you give us any sort of a hint about what other plans you guys have for next week?\xc2\xa0 We know the President is traveling on Tuesday, but otherwise how you intend to keep pushing this message up until the Friday deadline?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other events or travel to announce.\xc2\xa0 He will be going to Newport News, Virginia next week, as you know, to highlight the negative consequences of sequester and how they will be felt in that town, in that state.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is we have a full agenda, but it is certainly going to be the case next week that sequester and the impending deadline will I think consume a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s attention here\xc2\xa0 -- both on this side of the podium and your side.\xc2\xa0 And I think that our activities will include engaging, as they have in the past, engaging with Congress, hoping that we can find resolution here, hoping we can find an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not -- the smaller agreement, just as was the case at the end of last year, is not asking of either side, because of its size, to make all of the hard decisions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A lot of that work would still be saved for completing the job of hitting the $4 trillion-plus target a broader deficit-reduction deal.\xc2\xa0 But as the Senate proposal shows and other proposals have shown, you can do this as they did in December, in a way that is balanced but should not be that difficult.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping -- we remain hopeful that that will happen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the interesting things that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in some of these polls -- and I know you mentioned some polling in your conversation with Brendan Buck, with the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office last night --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good friend, Brendan.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a large number --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean that seriously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a large percentage of Americans who are unaware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen with this sequester, don\'t even know what the sequester is, whether it should be called sequestration or sequester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all still struggling with that one, I think.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are these warnings, like Secretary LaHood\xe2\x80\x99s warnings, coming so late in the game?\xc2\xa0 I mean we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing about FAA delays one week before the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I refrained from interjecting because he\xe2\x80\x99s a Cabinet Secretary, but I wanted to say -- I wanted to leap to the podium and point that we put out, as mandated by law, a report on the implementation of sequester, I believe last September, because the deadline at that time was January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we have been talking about this and answering question, and making clear that the planning was in effect in the lead-up to the potential deadline at the end of last year.</p>\n<p>And it was only -- remember, we\xe2\x80\x99re now, what, seven weeks since the 1st of the year, so it was only -- it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been that long since the last deadline passed, but it was pushed back by the fiscal cliff deal.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of concern, obviously, late last year; in fact, a great deal of concern on the part of Republicans about the potential for sequester taking effect.\xc2\xa0 They seem to have had a change of heart about that.\xc2\xa0 But at the time there was great concern expressed by Republicans about that.</p>\n<p>What was also the case is we were engaged -- because of the other deadlines, the fiscal cliff, the fact that there was the potential that taxes would go up on middle-class Americans around the country -- we were in engaged in negotiations with the Speaker of the House in an effort to try to achieve a bigger deal that would have both dealt with averting those tax hikes and further deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the Speaker walked away from that deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the environment was different.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing any flexibility from -- it was different then than it is now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing much interest at this point from Republican leaders in even engaging in a discussion about how we can move forward with a balanced package.\xc2\xa0 The line they keep drawing in the sand is, I don\'t care what the public says, I don\'t care who is hurt by it; our position -- the Republican position -- is cuts only, burden borne only by senior citizens, children with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair read of the substance of the conversations that went on between the President and Republican leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out those conversations.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that the leaders themselves who have had those conversations with the President aren\xe2\x80\x99t reading them out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We continue to, as a broad matter -- not specific to any one conversation -- to make the case that compromise is available here; that compromise is represented by taking a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, it really is important to me -- you can\'t -- the sort of pox on both their houses, false equivalence business that a lot of -- some commentators engage in where everybody is to blame equally here for how we got to this problem because nobody will compromise, but it is just factually incorrect.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, going back to that basic premise that it\xe2\x80\x99s harder for Democrats to go along with spending cuts and entitlement savings and harder for Republicans to go with revenue increases -- so who has made the hard choices here?\xc2\xa0 Who has made the tough proposals?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to that point, Democrats like to say Republicans only control one-half of one-third of government.\xc2\xa0 So shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they just have one-half of one-third of the blame?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that we can\'t get anything done without a bill passing the House of Representatives, and the Democratic Party and the President of the United States do not control the House of Representatives.</p>\n<p>We are confident that there is in excess of a majority in the Senate that would support the balanced approach that the President has put forward, that the Senate Democrats have put forward.\xc2\xa0 And we know, because your polling outfits tell the public this, that the public supports the balanced approach that the President has put forward.\xc2\xa0 We also know it\xe2\x80\x99s the best economic policy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I was asked yesterday, I think, why can\'t -- doesn\'t the President have some power to just make the sequester go away on his own?\xc2\xa0 And, of course, he would enjoy having that power, but the law of the land does not give it to him.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, even before we heard from Secretary LaHood, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some dire warnings coming from the administration.\xc2\xa0 Just to tick through a few, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about more wildfires, more workplace deaths, higher risk of terrorism, criminals set free.\xc2\xa0 Is there any exaggeration going on here?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think all of those things come from reduced numbers of people fighting fires, reduced numbers of people doing inspections of our food, reduced numbers of people engaging in air traffic control.\xc2\xa0 I mean, those are just the facts, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No other way to squeeze 3 percent out of the federal budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we had this colloquy yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that you are talking about a 13 percent cut in our defense budget and 9 percent cut in our nondefense discretionary budget this year.\xc2\xa0 And there is no way to do that, based on the way the law is written, without having hugely negative impacts on individuals and families.\xc2\xa0 Furloughs would have to happen.\xc2\xa0 Layoffs would have to happen.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just us saying this.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t believe us, maybe you believe the CBO.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you believe Macroeconomics Advisers or Moody\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 They have projected fully a half a percentage point reduction in GDP growth.\xc2\xa0 And you know, because you cover this stuff, what that means economically.\xc2\xa0 They have projected three-quarters of a million people will lose their jobs if the sequester takes effect and stays in effect.</p>\n<p>Those are real-world consequences.\xc2\xa0 These are real people.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not political leverage.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re out there making clear that this is an important issue to deal with because of the real-world implications.\xc2\xa0 The reason why the President continues to put forward and we made clear again on paper what we have been making clear all along, the President\xe2\x80\x99s very reasonable offer remains on the table because he wants to avoid this.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s just, again, go back to my basic point.\xc2\xa0 It is not an easy sell to Democrats to go along as part of a big deal with superlative CPI.\xc2\xa0 It is not an easy argument necessarily to get Democrats to go along with the reforms that the President has put in place in his proposal on entitlement reforms or with the spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 It was not easy to sign into law $1.1 trillion in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 But he has done it, and Democrats have done it.\xc2\xa0 And what we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen from Republicans is anything equivalent.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just looking for a negotiating partner here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just looking for somebody to meet us halfway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this hundred-city tour going to be cancelled?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I saw somebody -- a reporter sent me this right before I came out here.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a chance to ask anybody about it.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll get back to you on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this would be the kind of thing, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you wouldn\'t -- specific Cabinet members all around the country --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that a Republican member has sent this around.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have an answer for it, but I\'ll look into it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the broader question, Jay, would be to prioritize those things out of a sequester matrix, wouldn\'t it?\xc2\xa0 For this President to say, we can do without those things?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the sequester matrix, so I\'m not sure what that means, but it sounds cool.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You understand what I\'m saying.\xc2\xa0 The President would prioritize these things out of the budget and not label them a priority against meat and poultry inspections, against FAA air traffic controllers, against wildfire fighters.\xc2\xa0 I mean, wouldn\'t he?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would urge you to look at the law and look at what --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the flexibility there is in the law, and it is extremely limited.\xc2\xa0 And even if it weren\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\'s extremely limited, but the dollars and cents can be applied at agency discretion.\xc2\xa0 If there\'s a hundred-city tour, it can be decided --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the talking point based on a letter that a Republican just sent moments ago.\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer for it at this time, but I will look into it.\xc2\xa0 You can find an individual thing and say that this could be cut -- and maybe it should be, whatever it is -- but it represents a drop in the bucket to an $85 billion cut, a 13 percent cut to our defense budget, and a 9 percent cut to our nondefense discretionary budget this year, this fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 This is not spread out over 10 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is not something you can backload.\xc2\xa0 This happens now and it affects real people.\xc2\xa0 And, again, don\'t take our word for it.\xc2\xa0 Look at what Republicans used to say about it until I guess some consultant told them to say something else.\xc2\xa0 Look at what CBO and Macroeconomics Advisers and Moody\'s have been saying.\xc2\xa0 These are just the facts of the matter.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons why we\'re here, one of the reasons why we had the fiscal cliff fight and why we\'re discussing this is that everybody recognizes that these kind of indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts aren\'t good for the economy, aren\'t good for our defense, and they\'re not the way to sensibly reduce our deficit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying this President, as all Presidents before him, took pride in prioritizing.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just asking, as a priority for the President, the signal to the agencies would be prioritize your core functions --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- over non-essential functions like this or something like it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I appreciate on the item that you mentioned and I\'m sure that somebody will get back to you with an answer on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is you just had a Cabinet Secretary with enormous responsibility for an agency that affects everybody who travels in our skies tell you exactly that -- that that\'s what he is doing on the instructions of the President.\xc2\xa0 Within the law, he\'s looking at every available mechanism to lessen the impact of these cuts on the core mission of the Department of Transportation, the core mission of FAA.\xc2\xa0 So I think the answer is to you, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This may be self-evident, but is it your position from the podium today to instruct or ask the Senate Democratic leadership to with all due speed next week pass their alternative to the sequester and send it to the House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We would absolutely like to see the Senate take up and pass legislation that would avert the sequester in a balanced way, and the House to do that as well, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And within that context, it\'s $85 billion over the next nine months remaining in our fiscal year.\xc2\xa0 Does the deal that the White House envisions have to be $85 billion, or would it be smaller than that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The buy-down --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would be $85 billion --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The buy-down could be -- look, it was two months on January 1st, December 31st -- it could be that.\xc2\xa0 But the bill that has been put forward by Democrats in the Senate I believe takes it to the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 The sequester, as you know, the $1.2 trillion is stretched over 10, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that\xe2\x80\x99s over the next -- all those fiscal years.\xc2\xa0 But just $85 billion is the contours of what you want, and you roughly have -- portion that half revenue and half spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 So the federal budget could live with --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point -- whatever the ratio is in the bill, I would point you to the President\'s overall approach to this, which has been two dollars in spending cuts to one in revenue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we\'ve heard over the last couple of years from Secretary Geithner, from Lael Brainard, from Mike Froman, their concerns that countries in the eurozone were cutting too much, too quickly.\xc2\xa0 To what extent does the President\'s experience in watching that inform his philosophy going into these negotiations?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, every country has dealt with the global economic crisis that befell us in 2007, 2008 in different ways.\xc2\xa0 We believe, and the President believes, that the approach that was taken here in Washington was the right one, and that as a result -- even though we suffered a calamitous recession, the worst of our lifetimes that took millions and millions of jobs -- we have been able through hard work and tough decisions, and the grit and determination of the American people, to come to a position where the economy has been growing steadily.\xc2\xa0 And it has been creating jobs -- over 6 million private-sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 That work is not done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the focus that the President has had was one that prioritized in the beginning the need to stop the bleeding, the need to avert a depression.\xc2\xa0 And the actions that he took with Congress in 2009 are widely viewed to have done that.\xc2\xa0 And then to, as things began to stabilize, to go about the business of getting our fiscal house in order in a reasonable, balanced, common-sense way.\xc2\xa0 And we have been doing that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, it hasn\'t always been pretty, but over the past year and a half the President has signed into law now $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction; a significant portion of that has been spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s been done in a way that has allowed the economy to continue to grow and create jobs -- not fast enough, not enough jobs, but it\'s been positive growth and positive job creation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I mean, I think -- I don\'t have the graph I had yesterday here, today, but the one that showed the dramatic decrease in the deficit in the last several years, the sharpest decrease in the deficit since World War II.\xc2\xa0 And then, what would happen based on our projections if the President\'s proposal to Speaker Boehner were implemented in terms of bringing that deficit down even further and stabilizing it below 3 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the approach we believe is right, because it\'s the best for sustained economic growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent was that, though, a powerful negative example for him?\xc2\xa0 People\'s outlooks change from their experiences in the presidency.\xc2\xa0 I have heard that it was a big spur for him to take this particular position.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to characterize the President\'s thinking on what other countries have been doing.\xc2\xa0 He\'s focused on what he believed was the right course for the United States, and believes that while we have significant work to do to continue to grow our economy and have it create jobs, that we made the right choices.\xc2\xa0 And the results have borne that out.</p>\n<p>Again, very much like the fact that we need to continue to focus on growing our economy, expanding the middle class, helping people who aspire to the middle class enter the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why that\'s his number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been the focus of his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s why the debate we\'re having over this crazy thing called sequester or sequestration is so important, because the last thing we should be doing in Washington is throwing a wrench in an economy that has been moving in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 First, just one month ago, Secretary Clinton said that the U.S. opposes any unilateral action seeking to undermine Japan\'s administration --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, who said that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton is no longer Secretary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, former Secretary.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I see.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, she said the U.S. will oppose any unilateral actions seeking to undermine Japan\'s administration over Diaoyu Islands.\xc2\xa0 And I just want to know, is that the firm position that the President will address?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen those comments.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the President\'s meeting with the Prime Minister in just a little while here, and there will be a pool spray, and I think they both will have statements.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t want to get ahead of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on North Korea.\xc2\xa0 Russia and China today -- they say they oppose any military intervention in North Korea.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the position of the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would urge you to hear what the President has to say today.\xc2\xa0 I think we got to go, because --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I do just one quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, one more, Kristen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on or confirm the reports that the United States is preparing to establish a drone base in Northwest Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think those reports are fairly old, but I have no comment on that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, sir?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do have a week ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Old but no comment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I remember -- I don\'t know, is this a new report?\xc2\xa0 There was a report that I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in light of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- didn\'t comment on the other day or I had a comment on.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure this is a new report.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timeframe on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get back to you, Kristen.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure what our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Sunday, the President and First Lady will welcome the National Governors Association to the White House for the 2013 Governors Dinner.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President and Dr. Biden will also attend.</p>\n<p>On Monday, the President and the Vice President will deliver remarks to the National Governors Association in the State Dining Room.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady and Dr. Biden will also deliver remarks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will travel, as you know, to Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries in Newport News, Virginia -- region of my forebears -- to highlight the devastating impact that the sequester will have on jobs and middle-class families if congressional Republicans fail to compromise to avert the sequester by March 1st.\xc2\xa0 In just seven days, a series of automatic cuts could go into effect that would severely affect companies like this one that depend on the defense industry and its workers.\xc2\xa0 This company has a supplier base in all 50 states, many of which are small businesses that rely solely on Newport News Shipbuilding for their business.\xc2\xa0 The President will return to Washington, D.C. later in the day.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will deliver remarks at the unveiling of a statue of Rosa Parks at the United States Capitol.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will deliver remarks at the Business Council Dinner here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And on Thursday and Friday of next week, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thank you all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, real quickly, have there been any furloughs in the White House?\xc2\xa0 Has the Chief of Staff ordered any furloughs?\xc2\xa0 Is your staff going to be affected?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I took this question.\xc2\xa0 As you know and has been reported, the EOP is affected by the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure that the OMB has been working on that as it has with every agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:29 P.M.
