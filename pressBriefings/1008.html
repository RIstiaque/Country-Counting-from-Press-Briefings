Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:14 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcement at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tBen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a suddenly optimistic tone, it seems, on the Hill about getting all the last-minute business done, including the payroll tax; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure I heard that kind of tone from the President today.\xc2\xa0 So where do we stand, from the White House perspective?\xc2\xa0 Are we close to a deal, or at least closer to a deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 What you heard from the President today is him making clear what his position is, which is that he\xe2\x80\x99s out there making sure that middle-class Americans, working Americans, 160 million Americans, don\xe2\x80\x99t wake up on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day to find that their taxes went up because Congress refused to take action.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s his number-one priority.\xc2\xa0 And he is insisting that Congress do its work, that Congress do the work that they should be able to do very easily because Republicans say they support this, and take care of the working men and women in this country, everyone who gets a paycheck.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is also true that there are ongoing conversations happening on the Hill and among leaders on the Hill and representatives of the President to try to see how we can get this done.\xc2\xa0 And it should be able to get done, both the payroll tax cut extension, the extension of unemployment insurance, and the spending bill, the so-called omnibus, that Congress needs to take care of before it goes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what cannot happen is that Congress takes care of its spending bill but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take action to ensure that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 taxes [don\xe2\x80\x99t] go up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what would Americans think -- it would certainly, I think, raise the number, the percentage of Americans who have already told, in I think NBC\xe2\x80\x99s poll -- more than 40 percent who say this is the worst Congress in history -- and we have a long history now -- that number would certainly go up, and the approval numbers would go down, and that would be just and right.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, because Republicans have indicated that they want the payroll tax cut extended, which is a change from the position we heard just a few short weeks ago, and we\xe2\x80\x99re very -- we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly encouraged by signs of a willingness by everyone to work together to get this important business done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No matter how the payroll tax and the unemployment benefits are ultimately paid for, assuming this gets done, is it an article of faith at the White House that the wealthy must pay more in some fashion?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is to ensure that Americans, 160 million Americans, don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on average $1,000.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe made clear in his full American Jobs Act proposal the way that he would pay for all of it, including the payroll tax cut extension and expansion, and he certainly believes it is eminently fair, both in the way that he preferred paying for it and the way that Senate Democrats preferred paying for it, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not too much to ask -- referring to the Senate Democratic version -- 300,000 Americans, the 300,000 wealthiest Americans, to pay a little bit more so that 160 million Americans who are getting a paycheck every week don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 That to him seemed fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe priority here, however, was not the pay-for.\xc2\xa0 The focus on the pay-for is slightly mistargeted, because the priority here is making sure Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up, working -- hardworking middle-class Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have said -- I have said from the beginning of this process that we are open to different means of paying for it, and certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference is that this tax cut extension be paid for.\xc2\xa0 We note, with some irony, that Republicans, at least in the House, have it within their own bylaws that tax cuts don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be paid for, but there is this insistence when it comes to middle-class tax cuts that that not be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegardless, we\xe2\x80\x99re open to other pay-fors; we have been from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is, will Americans see their taxes go up on January 1st?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 The President was planning to leave for Hawaii on the 17th.\xc2\xa0 When is he planning to leave now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has made clear on earlier occasions that he will stay here as long as it takes to ensure that Congress does not leave town without raising -- without extending the payroll tax cut and making sure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a crystal ball to tell you when this will be resolved.\xc2\xa0 As you noted at the beginning, there are some signs that cooperation may be taking place and that compromise might occur and that we can get these issues resolved sooner rather than later, but I would not hazard to guess when that would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the White House strategy on the payroll tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 The decision to drop the millionaire surtax, how did that come about?\xc2\xa0 Was it the President?\xc2\xa0 Was it the Democratic leadership?\xc2\xa0 And why now?\xc2\xa0 And what do you think about this perception that this means that you\xe2\x80\x99re caving in to the Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to what I said to Ben.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority here hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been to raise taxes.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority has been to lower taxes, to keep -- well, actually, to lower them, to extend the payroll tax cut and expand it for the middle class.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe believed that it was the fair and right way to pay for it to ask, in the case of the Senate Democratic version, 300,000 millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more so that Americans, 160 million of them, could have their taxes reduced next year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the issue here hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the pay-fors, as I just said in answer to Ben.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear from the beginning that we were open to pay-fors that -- alternative pay-fors as long as they were economically responsible and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick it to the middle class, the very people you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help with this tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what your question contains within it is the observation that Republicans refused to ask 300,000 millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more so that 160 million working and middle-class Americans didn\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up; they refused, all but a few -- or one, I guess, in the case in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re open to figuring out a way how to do this that, again, is economically responsible and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt the very people that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help.\xc2\xa0 But the priority here has not been the pay-for; it has been ensuring that Americans who are working hard, as we emerge from this Great Recession, don\xe2\x80\x99t get a tax hike on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 That would be a very unwelcome New Year\xe2\x80\x99s gift to the American people, and Congress should not give that gift.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come to you, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tGeorge.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any reaction from the White --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this for months.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s annoying.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Tell it to your colleagues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I like it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just decide you\xe2\x80\x99re going to break with decades of precedent and just going to -- instead of every --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ensure that 49 people in these seats --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, then take a question about bestiality, go for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and move back and forth and --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, America wants to know about your position on bestiality.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely going to take care of everyone in the front row.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, George.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here I thought we were friends.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Any White House reaction to Democratic Senator Wyden joining with Paul Ryan on a compromise on the privatization of Medicare today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 George, as you know, President Obama is committed to ensuring that Medicare is strong and affordable for seniors and taxpayers.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President proposed a plan to strengthen Medicare, cut waste, fight fraud and reduce Medicare and Medicaid costs by $320 billion over the next 10 years as part of a balanced approach to reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has made clear that any proposal to reform Medicare must protect our seniors and preserve the promise to current and future beneficiaries of guaranteed affordable Medicare coverage.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are concerned that Wyden-Ryan, the proposal you mentioned, like Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s earlier proposal, would undermine rather than strengthen Medicare.\xc2\xa0 The Wyden-Ryan proposal could, over time, cause the traditional Medicare program to \xe2\x80\x9cwither on the vine,\xe2\x80\x9d because it would raise premiums, forcing many seniors to leave traditional Medicare and join private plans.\xc2\xa0 And it would shift costs from the government to seniors.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the end of the day, this plan would end Medicare as we know it for millions of seniors.\xc2\xa0 The Wyden-Ryan proposal is the wrong way to reform Medicare.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s our position.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t support the Wyden-Ryan plan, is the President going to be proposing a plan to solve the problem of Medicare and funding in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I mentioned at the top is the President has, in fact, proposed that as part of his comprehensive deficit reduction and debt control plan, and he looks forward to working with Congress on that.\xc2\xa0 And his whole point during --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a solution, or -- I thought it just nibbles around the edges, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the whole point the President made during the negotiations this summer on the debt ceiling, and again when he put forward his proposal for the super committee, is that if we approach this in a balanced way, the way that bipartisan commissions recommend that we approach it, the way that the vast majority of Americans want us to approach it, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to privatize Medicare.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to severely constrain Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to slice or slash programs that fund education or innovation or clean energy, because if we do it in a balanced way, we can reform entitlements in a way that preserves Medicare for seniors and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stick them with a $6,000-a-year cost hike as the original Ryan plan would.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I understand.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying that what the President proposed is all that needs to be done to contain the growth in health care and Medicare, and whatever problems Medicare creates.\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Ryan-Wyden plan is attempting to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What it\xe2\x80\x99s attempting to do, although within it, as I understand it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- even in their own proposal, there\xe2\x80\x99s only the hope of cost savings.\xc2\xa0 So what the President has proposed, as I just laid out, would result in $320 billion of savings over the next 10 years; would reform the entitlement programs in a way that would continue to allow them to provide the essential services that, in the case of Medicare, seniors deserve and must have; and would not require the kind of radical privatization or ending of Medicare as we know it that the Ryan proposal suggests and that the Wyden-Ryan plan gets you to eventually.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a yes, that all that would need to be done to Medicare is what the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that five years, 10 years down the road that -- I mean, we are always having to push forward with reforms in different parts of our government.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, as you know, dealt in an expansive way -- $4 trillion if you include the trillion in savings through the Budget Control Act -- dealt with our need to reduce our deficit and get our debt under control at the same level of magnitude as the Ryan plan.\xc2\xa0 And it did it without asking seniors to bear the burden of the cost.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this goes back to the need for balance.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do something this radical.\xc2\xa0 As the President has said, our problems are not as great as they are in some countries that we would have to do something that radical if we were only willing to take a balanced approach, which is what the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not advocating for the Wyden-Ryan plan, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying -- you were actually saying that\xe2\x80\x99s all that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The other question I have is Speaker Boehner today said there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to tie the omnibus bill to the payroll tax because he is willing to keep Congress here, to keep the House here, so that as soon as the Senate passes the payroll tax fix, the House will reconvene within 24 hours and act on whatever the Senate passes.\xc2\xa0 Your response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate on behalf of the Senate or the President here.\xc2\xa0 These are ongoing conversations.\xc2\xa0 What is unacceptable is the idea that we should take a promise of future action on behalf of 160 million Americans when, as you know, once Congress passes a spending bill, they can go home, and it sounds like the Speaker would let them go home.\xc2\xa0 He might call them back or he might not.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a promise.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we want is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe his promise?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 What is essential here, the absolute top priority that this President has, is that Congress makes sure it does not go home on its vacation until it has taken care of the payroll tax cut extension and unemployment insurance extension, because it would be unacceptable, he believes, for Congress to hike taxes on 160 million Americans as it\xe2\x80\x99s heading out the door here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to tie the two, right?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do this -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s trying -- he says he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to avoid a government shutdown tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 Congressman Moran has said the deal has been done and the Congress is ready to act.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The deal is not done until some of these issues that Senator Reid and others have mentioned, I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned, need to be resolved.\xc2\xa0 They are resolvable, no question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to shut down the government.\xc2\xa0 There is time to get all of it done.\xc2\xa0 And if more time is needed, Congress should do what it\xe2\x80\x99s done seven times already in this year and pass a CR, a short-term CR, just to ensure that they get their work done.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to talk about a government shutdown.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just surprised that the Speaker of the House is basically pledging that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to do this, I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep the Congress here, we\xe2\x80\x99ll reconvene as soon as they\xe2\x80\x99re ready --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we need to make sure --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- as soon as the Senate passes something, and you\xe2\x80\x99re basically saying, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe you, basically said --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we need to make sure -- we need to make sure -- no, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a promise is meaningless.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that there are negotiations going on.\xc2\xa0 As Ben noted in his questions, there have been some signs of a willingness to find some bipartisan compromises here on these big remaining issues.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is, this is not a question where 50 percent is okay, because if you take these two issues, the omnibus and the payroll tax cut, it is not okay just to get one of them.\xc2\xa0 It simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t, because that means 160 million Americans are stuck with the bill of congressional inaction.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tLesley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, we had a story today in McClatchy that parts of the story that President Obama gave in September awarding the Medal of Honor may be untrue, substantiated or exaggerated, according to a lot of military documents we looked at.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House find this a concern, and are you intending to do anything about it, look into whether they embellished history?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lesley, the President was very proud to present the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Meyer for his extraordinary service in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 As the President said that day, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Sergeant Dakota Meyer, we see the best of a generation that has served through a decade of war.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tThe answer to your question is no.\xc2\xa0 Everyone, even the reporter who wrote yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s article, agrees that Sergeant Meyer displayed extraordinary heroism.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, a subsequent article, within I think hours, by that same reporter last night makes it clear that Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s comrades feel he deserves the Medal of Honor.\xc2\xa0 President Obama was proud to present it on behalf of a grateful nation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And suggestions that there were some problems --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I got a little whiplash reading the two articles that McClatchy put out.\xc2\xa0 One said one thing; the other said the other.\xc2\xa0 What the President believes is exactly what I said, that this young man is the best of a generation that has served through a decade of war, and he was proud to present him the Medal of Honor.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You keep saying that the pay-fors is not the issue, but the President at one point was supporting the insistence on the millionaires\xe2\x80\x99 surtax, and then is no longer doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Dan, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll say again -- and I would encourage you to review the transcripts -- I have said from the beginning that we are open to other pay-fors.\xc2\xa0 We supported --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 My question is, what changed, though --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But you said we insisted.\xc2\xa0 We supported one version because we think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what changed?\xc2\xa0 What changed?\xc2\xa0 Why did he drop that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think all but one Republican refused to ask the 300,000 richest Americans, millionaires and billionaires, to pay a little bit more so that 160 million Americans could get a tax cut next year, or not see their taxes go up, at the very least.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what happened.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that was a fair way to do it, an eminently fair way to do it, but Republicans, almost in lockstep, disagreed.\xc2\xa0 They were willing to say no to a tax cut for 160 million hardworking Americans rather than ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s their position, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reality.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have said from the beginning that while we supported the Senate Democratic pay-for and while the President himself put forward a pay-for, that we were open to discussions about alternative ways to fund this payroll tax cut extension and to fund unemployment insurance extension, as long as they were economically responsible and they did not take from the middle class with one hand what we were giving with the other in a payroll tax cut extension.\xc2\xa0 So it should not stick it to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Those are our principles.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it stands now, what is the biggest hurdle to getting a deal done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I want to reflect the optimism here that some expressed on the Hill this morning that we believe a deal can get done and that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to talk about a government shutdown because if we need a couple of extra days, I think the American people would expect Congress to pass a short-term continuing resolution to ensure that they had time to get this fundamental piece of business done.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is room for compromise.\xc2\xa0 There are issues that need to be resolved in the spending measure, but they can be resolved.\xc2\xa0 And there are certainly many paths here to getting a payroll tax cut extension done.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that a willingness to be reasonable here would go a long way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other question.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you guys put something out on a briefing that the President received, a national security holiday briefing.\xc2\xa0 Is there any known threat out there or anything in particular that the administration is concerned about with the holidays approaching?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, nothing -- I have nothing for you on that.\xc2\xa0 This is about making sure, at a moment -- at a time of the year like this one, that everyone is following the President\xe2\x80\x99s directive here that we take every measure necessary to ensure the safety and security of the American people, both here and abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You had objections to the defense bill; you\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped them.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of civil liberties experts who are convinced that that bill contains the seed of the future detention of U.S. citizens indeterminately if they\xe2\x80\x99re suspected of terrorism.\xc2\xa0 Are you really that convinced that there was a big enough change that you\xe2\x80\x99d drop an important issue like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me make clear that this was not the preferred approach of this administration, and we made clear that any bill that challenges or constrains the President\xe2\x80\x99s critical authorities to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the nation would prompt the President\xe2\x80\x99s senior advisors to recommend a veto.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter intensive engagement by senior administration officials, the administration has succeeded in prompting the authors of the detainee provisions to make several important changes, including the removal of problematic provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we remain concerned about the uncertainty that this law will create for our counterterrorism professionals, the most recent changes give the President additional discretion in determining how the law will be implemented, consistent with our values and the rule of law, which are at the heart of our country\xe2\x80\x99s strength.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis legislation authorizes critical funding for military personnel overseas, and its passage sends an important signal that Congress supports our efforts as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan lead, while ensuring that our military can meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the provision in particular that you reference, it does not increase or otherwise change any of our authorities in regard to detention of American citizens.\xc2\xa0 It is simply a restatement of the authorities that were granted to the President in 2001.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this just a recognition that ultimately the courts would settle disputes like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, the changes give discretion to the President in the implementation of this law.\xc2\xa0 If, as this law is being implemented, the President feels that our counterterrorism professionals are being constrained and that their flexibility is being constrained in a way that does not reflect our values, then he will ask for changes.\xc2\xa0 He will go to the authors of these provisions and ask for legislative changes that are separate from the defense authorization bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, the changes that were made were sufficient to allow senior advisors to withdraw the recommendation of a veto, but we are still concerned about the uncertainty that this law creates.</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President spoke in Kansas, he spoke about his deep conviction that everyone pay their fair share?\xc2\xa0 How deep is the President\xe2\x80\x99s conviction if he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to abandon the surtax on millionaires or that even the wealthy pay more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, I know you were here just a few short minutes ago when I answered this question.\xc2\xa0 The issue is not how it gets paid for.\xc2\xa0 The President has his clear preference.\xc2\xa0 He believes, like the majority of the American people, that the 300,000 wealthiest millionaires and billionaires in this country ought to pay a little bit more so that 160 million working Americans can get a payroll tax cut extension.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So now you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not important how it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that hold for future pieces of legislation, too?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, the priority here is making sure that regular folks out there who get a paycheck don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up by an average of $1,000 next year.\xc2\xa0 We have said from the beginning that we are open to different ways of paying for it.\xc2\xa0 We, at times, marvel at the whiplash caused by the sudden interest in paying for a tax cut among some Republicans who heretofore have insisted that tax cuts not be paid for.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an interest we share.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s the responsible thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear here.\xc2\xa0 The only reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re having this debate is because the President put it in the American Jobs Act, extension and expansion of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 A few short weeks ago I stood up here and read to you numerous statements by leading Republicans who said they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even for a payroll tax cut extension.\xc2\xa0 They were perfectly happy to see 160 million Americans -- including, I would assume, a majority of their own constituents -- get stuck with a $1,000 tax hike next year, rather than ask millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit extra, folks who over the past 30 years have done exceptionally well while the middle class has struggled.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve come a fair distance here.\xc2\xa0 Republicans now say they want this payroll tax cut extension, that they are interested in seeing middle-class Americans not have their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0 What I think is essential here is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s priority has not been how it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for or raising taxes, it\xe2\x80\x99s been lowering taxes for the vast majority of Americans out there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President first proposed his American Jobs Act, with the price tag of over $400 billion, part of that was asking the wealthiest Americans to pay more --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not millionaires, those making over $250,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 Successive parts that since have been broken up of the President\xe2\x80\x99s job plan have not passed.\xc2\xa0 Now you\xe2\x80\x99re on the payroll tax, and again, that\xe2\x80\x99s also in jeopardy.\xc2\xa0 Is the President willing to abandon what has been the embodiment of his core value that he\xe2\x80\x99s been speaking about repeatedly, which is that the wealthier pay more and everybody pay their fair share, so he can get one part -- at least one part of his jobs bill passed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President is interested in is making sure that most Americans -- most Americans out there who have an income, 160 million Americans who get a paycheck, don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up by $1,000 next year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the right position for those Americans --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care how it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right position for the American economy.\xc2\xa0 You misstate what the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities here are.\xc2\xa0 We have -- in the American Jobs Act we had an opportunity to put 400,000 teachers back in the classroom.\xc2\xa0 The President believed that the right way to pay for that was asking -- to close some subsidies for corporations, asking the wealthiest to pay more.\xc2\xa0 There were a variety of provisions within our broad American Jobs Act proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans rejected that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve rejected everything that would benefit the economy and the middle class and working Americans when the suggestion is that the wealthiest of us should pay a little bit more to make that happen.\xc2\xa0 Because what\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember is the American Jobs Act would not have added a dime to our deficit.\xc2\xa0 The President is very concerned about getting our deficits and debt under control.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe issue with the payroll tax cut, an issue that Republicans used to support and now in the last few weeks support again, is that the American people cannot in this stage of our recovery -- or should not -- be asked to pay $1,000 on average in taxes extra next year.\xc2\xa0 The President is very interested, that is his priority, in making sure that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and ensuring that Congress does not leave town having protected their own tax breaks and the tax breaks of the wealthiest Americans, but not made sure that the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s been his priority here.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you seem, in all this, seem to be downplaying the notion -- when you say the priority here is not the pay-for, you seem to be downplaying the idea that the pay-for is important at all, when, in fact, when the President went to Congress that very first night in September, he said that this American Jobs Act is paid for and that it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to add one dime to the deficit, I think was his phrase.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you now opening the door to passing this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a big priority, the payroll tax cut extension, without it being paid for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We strongly prefer that it be paid for.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President put forward a proposal that it was paid for.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he supported the Democratic Senate alternative that had it paid for.\xc2\xa0 And certainly I have not seen any indication at this point that there is disagreement about the need to have it paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the question that you ask --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Senator Reid and Durbin have both said this week that you could pass it without it being paid for, citing the fact that Republicans, as you noted, in fairness, have passed this payroll tax cut extension before without paying for it.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve cited --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And generally believe that no tax cut needs to be paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So the door is now open to pass it without it being paid for.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not negotiating -- and I had this question in earlier weeks when we were talking about different ways to pay for the payroll tax cut here now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re at the endgame now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I know.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m saying -- my answer is the same.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate a hypothetical about whether -- if that were to happen --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the door closed?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying, under no circumstances --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because the President said he will not add a dime to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Is that now changed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, his American Jobs Act would not have added a dime to the deficit --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would not have.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- if Republicans hadn\xe2\x80\x99t blocked it.\xc2\xa0 And his proposal for the American Jobs Act, or at least the version that he supported -- or rather the payroll tax cut in the Senate that he supported -- would not have added a dime to the deficit.\xc2\xa0 I believe that we can -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly now -- that there are alternative ways to pay for this that can be found and compromised on that meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s principle that we don\xe2\x80\x99t do harm to the economy, we don\xe2\x80\x99t stick it to the middle class -- the very people we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help in this process.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo how this looks at the end is something I cannot foretell at this point.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are clear; he restated them again today.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on 160 million Americans who will see their taxes go up, on average, by $1,000 on January 1st if Congress were to leave town without taking care of this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you know that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to support the surcharge; they\xe2\x80\x99ve voted against it.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want the pipeline in the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 So how do you move forward?\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s solution -- since we\xe2\x80\x99re at the endgame here, and it\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a possibility -- it\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Rather than negotiating with you --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how are you going to pay for it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I will let those on the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, working with congressional Democrats and Republicans, come up with a compromise solution.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we certainly believe that\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear here; the President has made it clear.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority is ensuring that working -- hardworking Americans, middle-class Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on January 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Maliki was here this week.\xc2\xa0 There have been reports that a former commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which was -- U.S. officials say played a role in a 1996 terrorist attack that killed 19 U.S. servicemen -- he was here at the White House with Prime Minister Maliki because he\xe2\x80\x99s a transportation minister --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, whose report is that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe The Washington Times has reported it.\xc2\xa0 I think others have as well, but I think this is a Washington --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Could you give us an answer later, though, whether he was here and whether -- that a background check had been done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on it for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the prime reasons you gave for opposing the House version of the payroll tax bill was because it lifted the discretionary spending -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, lowered the discretionary spending caps.\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out any agreement that lowered them by any amount?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said about that specific Republican proposal is that the President would veto it.\xc2\xa0 Again, what the contours of a compromise would look like I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about from here.\xc2\xa0 But the principle behind our concern with that specific measure is that, while it was dressed up as one thing, the reality of it would be, in lowering the caps, the requirement that things like education and clean energy and innovation and other issues -- other areas would be further cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are two problems with that.\xc2\xa0 One, we had a deal, and we expect members of Congress to keep their word on a deal that\xe2\x80\x99s only a few months old, that lowered non-defense discretionary spending to the lowest percentage of our economy since Dwight Eisenhower was president.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about substantial cuts already.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the President certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.\xc2\xa0 Moreover, the principle here, as I have just stated a few times, is that we not do things that do harm to the very people we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to help through the middle-class tax cut.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo having said that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to tease out individual items and say, this one might work in some compromise proposal but this one won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s principles are clear, and he wants to make sure that Congress not leave town having not done something to ensure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that -- obviously, this is not your preference and you oppose it, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that any cuts to discretionary spending --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tease out individual items.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to tease out individual items and say that that\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable, because what was unacceptable was the bill that was presented to us and -- or rather presented, and that we issued a statement of administration policy on.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s another bill, we\xe2\x80\x99ll evaluate it once we see it.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You just talked about the negotiations that are going on.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been personally involved in the negotiations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as you know, he was here with -- or rather he invited and met with Senator Reid and other Senate Democratic leaders yesterday, and he\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in this very much so, as are key members of his team.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have telephone calls or meetings to read out to you, but absolutely the President is involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Speaker Boehner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have telephone calls or meetings to read out to you -- or email exchanges.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be speaking to Speaker Boehner?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that important for him to reach out to the Republicans as well, as we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to this deadline?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about what conversations he may or may not have in the future here, in the next several days.\xc2\xa0 But I can assure you that he is actively engaged in this, and has made sure that his team is directly engaged in this.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to do everything he can to ensure that the priority he laid out just an hour ago be met -- that Congress not leave Washington without making sure the middle class doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see its taxes go up on January 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he actively engaged with members of both parties, without reading out specific meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific calls or meetings to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But he is engaged.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer to this deadline of the government potentially shutting down.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration taken any steps to prepare for that at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the Office of Management and Budget oversees that process for the White House, for the administration, and I would refer you to them.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that there are standard operating procedures here with which we are, through recent experience, fairly familiar.\xc2\xa0 And the necessary actions are being taken and will be taken.\xc2\xa0 But -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s just out of an abundance of caution, and it\xe2\x80\x99s basically a requirement when we get this close to a deadline.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason to get there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s just no reason to get there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Senate leaders of both parties have made clear and other have made clear, the differences in the spending bill are resolvable.\xc2\xa0 And I think, as everybody now has made clear, that both parties want an extension of the payroll tax cut, both parties want an extension of unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we can\xe2\x80\x99t get that done.\xc2\xa0 And the President insists that Congress get that done, because it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable to leave town, go home on a month-long vacation, having not done something to prevent Americans\xe2\x80\x99 taxes from going up on January 1st -- when it would be so simple to get it done; when there\xe2\x80\x99s clearly now bipartisan support for getting it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe hope and expect that will happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMara, and then Mr. Collinson.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you explain what specifically is your problem with the Wyden-Ryan plan?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like the big news is that he\xe2\x80\x99s backed off replacing Medicare with a private system, and giving these vouchers that are capped.\xc2\xa0 It seems like a lot of the plan replicates the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 What is it specifically that you think the plan would undermine --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, what it does is it creates an unlevel playing field that would result in private plans being able to attract healthier Americans, thereby driving up costs and premiums for Medicare, and making it unsustainable for seniors to stay in traditional Medicare and force them to join private plans.\xc2\xa0 So the result is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the -- would be tied to the cost of Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the result is the same.\xc2\xa0 It basically forces -- it causes traditional Medicare to wither on the vine, to use a phrase from your past and mine, Mara.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary.\xc2\xa0 It would shift costs from the government to seniors, very much as the Ryan plan does.\xc2\xa0 And at the end of the day, it would end Medicare as we know it for millions of seniors.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just the wrong way to reform Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the bedrock position is that Medicare should remain a fee-for-service program without competition from private insurers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the bedrock position is that we do not need to end Medicare as we know it, which is what the Ryan plan does and what, on a longer timeframe here, the Ryan-Wyden proposal does.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s just not necessary.\xc2\xa0 That was the problem with the Ryan budget to begin with, was that, in order to reach the kinds of savings that he set -- the $4 trillion -- because he refused to ask wealthy Americans to pay a little bit more to raise revenues -- in fact, he extended and expanded tax breaks for wealthier Americans -- that meant that he had to end Medicare as we know it and stick 6,000 --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To balance the budget.\xc2\xa0 This is a plan that\xe2\x80\x99s confined to Medicare.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- well, it was a long-term deficit and debt reduction plan.\xc2\xa0 So what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is that we should then excise that, absent from even a deficit reduction and debt reduction plan, and stick it to seniors that way.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just not acceptable.</p>\n<p>\n\tNakamura, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to return a moment to the McClatchy story on the Medal of Honor winner.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re a former journalist, and I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how important to you and the White House it is that if the -- in answering her question you said that the President stands by awarding the medal because his own -- Dakota Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s own colleagues said he acted heroically.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I simply made clear, in answer to the question, that the same reporter who wrote that story posted a story shortly after that expansively cited testimony from Mr. Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s own comrades about his --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like anybody disagrees that he deserves the medal necessarily.\xc2\xa0 But how important to you and the White House is it that the President or that the White House corrects a narrative that may not actually reflect the facts and available evidence of that night, regardless of how heroically he acted?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But again, I would refer you to the Marine Corps.\xc2\xa0 And the process of vetting for Medal of Honor -- proposed Medal of Honor recipients is, as I understand it, quite extensive and thorough.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s done at the Department of Defense and by the branch of the military that\xe2\x80\x99s affected here, in this case the Marine Corps.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President was very proud to present the Medal of Honor to Sergeant Meyer.\xc2\xa0 He was that day and he remains proud today of his extraordinary service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the White House review the vetted transcript from the -- the transcript that the President read into the public record that day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who wrote that?\xc2\xa0 Was that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- were based on the extensive documentation provided by the Department of Defense and the Marine Corps, including sworn testimony from Sergeant Meyer himself and sworn eyewitness testimonies of others present at the scene.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhite House staff also personally spoke with Sergeant Meyer.\xc2\xa0 Our primary resource for the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks was the official documentation provided by the Marine Corps, including sworn testimony from Sergeant Meyer, and as I said, sworn eyewitness testimonies of others present.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President remains very proud of Sergeant Meyer and the remarkable acts of bravery that he displayed on that day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think -- yes, Stephen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In these negotiations on the Hill, is the White House prepared to discuss at all the Keystone pipeline, or is it still the position that A, that\xe2\x80\x99s beyond the purview of Congress to start with, and B, has nothing to do with the payroll tax?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly has nothing to do with payroll tax cut extension and expansion.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is beyond the purview of Congress to speed up a review process that is essential to making sure that all criteria here, all factors are weighed when a decision is made whether to grant a permit or not.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRemember, the process was extended because of opposition to the location of a pipeline through Nebraska -- opposition that included the Republican governor of that state.\xc2\xa0 Alternative routes are being explored.\xc2\xa0 I believe that the company that\xe2\x80\x99s seeking the permit has said recently, in the last day or two, that they have not even identified yet an alternate route.\xc2\xa0 So the idea that -- as the State Department has made clear -- that we could -- they could properly conduct a review in a 60-day time period is -- seems to be based on politics and not reality, or certainly not sound judgment.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s our position on what is clearly a highly extraneous provision of the House Republican proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tKate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say absolutely that the President would veto any legislation that has Keystone in it?\xc2\xa0 The word \xe2\x80\x9cveto\xe2\x80\x9d I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President said, I would remind you, is that he would reject a provision -- he would reject a proposal that tried to mandate approval of the Keystone project.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he said; I believe we were over in South Court when he said that, when he was asked about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tI, again, having -- what the State Department has said and having just explained in my answer to Steve there, what the House put forward was an attempt to speed up a process that circumvents the kind of thorough and necessarily cautious review that the State Department would need to conduct here.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong-headed and, I would say, counterproductive.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see what emerges from the discussions that are taking place on the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then instead of 60 days, if it was 90 days or the process was longer, would that be something he would consider?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the proper way for this to take place is for the State Department to conduct a thorough review based on decades of tradition here -- tradition that exists for a reason, because these are important decisions that need to be made.\xc2\xa0 And as I indicated earlier, the very company that\xe2\x80\x99s asking for a permit hasn\xe2\x80\x99t identified an alternate route.\xc2\xa0 So how could we possibly ask -- or try to short-circuit this process and have a review process take place that would clearly be too short for the kind of review that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other thing.\xc2\xa0 The managing director of the IMF said this morning that the crisis is unfolding in Europe and escalating.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious -- and also she said that -- Christine Lagarde said that it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the eurozone countries can\xe2\x80\x99t handle alone.</p>\n<p>\n\tIs there -- has the President made any phone calls to Merkel or any other leaders recently?\xc2\xa0 And is there a plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential calls or communications to read out.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously being briefed regularly on this by Secretary Geithner and others.\xc2\xa0 Our position on the important steps that Europe has taken thus far, and the need for Europe to take other steps to conclusively and decisively resolve this crisis hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with our European partners, offering them the advice that we can offer based on the experience that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, that we hope is helpful to resolving this.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything else on that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Carrie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain why the statement last night called the omnibus -- or the appropriations agreement -- why it was called a Republican proposal, given that Democratic appropriators on the Hill are saying they signed off in it?\xc2\xa0 Or is the agreement --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because the Republicans submitted a proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it does not -- is not a Democratic proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a Republican proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Democrats -- Democratic appropriators signed off on it, and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign off on the Republicans filing a bill at 11:40 at night on their own.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s just not the case.\xc2\xa0 And as Senator Reid made clear, there are still issues that need to be resolved that can be resolved, should be resolved.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress that has been made on the omnibus.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there was a -- this was about tactics and politics, having the Republicans put this down close to midnight last night.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s very much in doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about what they put out last night, not what was apparently under discussion earlier in the week and had been -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just a little confused, because --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the House Republicans, I believe, put forward -- filed a bill last night by themselves that is an omnibus bill.\xc2\xa0 And that is not a conference bill, it is not a Democratic and Republican bill, it is a House Republican bill, which is I\xe2\x80\x99m sure part of the atmospherics and tactics here.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s important is what we talked about at the top of the briefing, is that both sides seem to recognize that there is the capacity here to compromise, the path to compromise may be clear, the issues that still need to be resolved on the spending bill are resolvable.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tSeparate, and very important to the President, is the need to make sure that Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t have their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And it is not okay to resolve the differences in the spending bill and leave town without making sure that Americans -- 160 million Americans -- don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up by, on average, $1,000 next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat would be the height of irony, right?\xc2\xa0 That because of Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to extend the payroll tax cut they leave town having passed a trillion-dollar spending bill and a tax hike?\xc2\xa0 Talk about turning politics on its head.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It if was all worked out -- even if it was all in doubt and everybody agreed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, then they should pass it, if it\xe2\x80\x99s all worked out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The omnibus.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just having fun here -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be ironic, given what we think we know about the American political system and the two parties, that because of inaction by Congress on the payroll tax cut they simply left town having passed a trillion-dollar spending bill, and refused to take action and therefore ensured that there was a tax cut for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tax hike.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, a tax hike.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hike!\xc2\xa0 Hike!\xc2\xa0 Hike!</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been probably an hour since I started briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two, four, six, eight, hike!</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your statement came out --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your statement came out before they filed the bill last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know what, I think -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t looking at my watch when these things came out.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the point is.\xc2\xa0 What the Republicans did last night was clear.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that progress is going to be made on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 We all are, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, hoping that progress will be made on Capitol Hill, and that this essential work is completed in as close to an on-time fashion as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:12 P.M.
