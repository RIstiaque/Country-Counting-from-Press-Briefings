Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:00 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Let me start by speaking for all of you when I say thank goodness it\'s Friday.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any openings, so, Darlene, we can go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement this morning on Senator Harry Reid, saying that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to run for reelection.\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction to Senator Reid coming out so quickly and endorsing Chuck Schumer to succeed him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I saw those reports.\xc2\xa0 Obviously it\'s the responsibility of Democratic members of the Senate to decide who the Senate Democratic leader should be.\xc2\xa0 There was a point in time when the President did participate in those kinds of discussions when he himself was a member of the Senate Democrats, but at this point, we\'ll leave that up to them to decide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously the President, as he\xe2\x80\x99s indicated in his statement, has a deep appreciation for Senator Reid and all that they accomplished in working together over the last six years, and even before that, frankly.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to continuing to have Senator Reid as a close partner with this White House over the remaining 22 months of this President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems, though, that the endorsement of Schumer comes at the expense of Senator Durbin, who is close to the President. He\xe2\x80\x99s number two in the Senate behind Reid.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House or the President have any thoughts on this apparent snub of Senator Durbin?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that -- well, I\'ll just say that the President, obviously, has close relationships with a substantial number of members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 That certainly includes the close working relationship that we value with both Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin.\xc2\xa0 The President does not intend to endorse either man in what may be a contested race for the Senate leadership that will occur almost two years from now.</p>\n<p>So, at this point, we are certainly looking forward to Senator Reid, the current leader of the Senator Democrats, as the President makes the most of his remaining time in office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on Iran.\xc2\xa0 With the talks sort of heading into this final weekend before the deadline, what is the confidence level of the White House that a framework agreement will be reached either this weekend or by March 31st?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Darlene, it\'s true that Secretary Kerry, Secretary Moniz, Under Secretary Sherman, and others from the United States negotiating team are continuing to meet with members of the Iranian negotiating team in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 We do anticipate that some representatives from the EU will join those meetings.\xc2\xa0 Those meetings will continue through the weekend and it\'s possible those meetings could continue even into early next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as we\'ve said in the past, in recent weeks, that important progress has been made, but this President is not going to stop short of -- this President will not accept an agreement that does not accomplish our goals, which is to cut off every pathway that Iran has to acquiring a nuclear weapon, and securing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to cooperate with a set of intrusive inspections to verify their compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>We\'ve been very clear about what those general guidelines are, but it will require Iran to make substantial commitments and specific commitments.\xc2\xa0 But I would say the odds of success in this endeavor have not appreciably changed over the last few weeks, because Iran will have to make some very serious commitments in order to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following on that, does the President expect to be talking to other leaders this weekend ahead of those deadlines early next week on the Iran talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly possible that the President could telephone world leaders either over the course of today or even over the course of the weekend.\xc2\xa0 And if so, and if we\'re able to do so, then we will let you know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Yemen, I\'m wondering how concerned is the White House that, amid the military action that\'s happening there right now and the underlying conflict, that AQAP will sort of thrive under those circumstances?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Roberta, we\'ve been clear that we are always concerned when there are nations like Yemen that are gripped by chaos.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen in the past that extremist groups that aspire to carry out acts of violence against the West, including the United States, often try to capitalize on those situations, establish a safe haven and use them as a base to plot attacks against the West.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be concerned about that taking place in Yemen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact is we\'ve been concerned about those activities in Yemen for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ve acknowledged over the course of the last week or so that the instability in Yemen does not enhance our counterterrorism efforts in that country, but we continue to have significant counterterrorism resources and abilities in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And that means that we are able to, based on resources that we have in the region and based on relationships that we have in the region, we are able to apply significant pressure to the leaders of extremist organizations that may be operating there.\xc2\xa0 And that pressure has advanced our efforts to keep the American people safe, and we\'re going to continue to apply that pressure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you had to put counterterrorism efforts on hold amidst the military operations that are going on there right now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the status of our counterterrorism operations at this point other than to say that we continue to have capabilities in the region that allow us to apply pressure against extremist groups that are operating in Yemen and may be plotting against the West.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have resources in the region, we continue to have relationships in the region that are beneficial to those efforts.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With Saudi Arabia now working ostensibly against Iran in Yemen, and the U.S. supporting Saudi Arabia, does that affect the working relationship in regards to the nuclear negotiations with Iran at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, simply because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear about the fact that the list of grievances that the United States has with Iran are lengthy -- is lengthy.\xc2\xa0 And there are -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities throughout the region, their support for terror around the world and their unjust detention of Americans, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long list of concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\xc2\xa0 That concerning behavior includes menacing our closest ally in the region, Israel.</p>\n<p>We have a long list of concerns, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is trying to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in this diplomacy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on achieving that goal.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we believe here at the White House is that because of the long list of concerns that we have with Iran, it makes it all that more important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s ample evidence to indicate why this is so -- that the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is to reach a diplomatic agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do in advance of the deadline.\xc2\xa0 But it will require, as I mentioned to Darlene, Iran making very serious commitments.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if they are able to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to have the U.S. and Iran working against each other now in Yemen, which is a shambles, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t increase tensions at the negotiating table or put further strain on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at all?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Michelle, the list of grievances that I have run through have existed for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 They long pre-dated the beginning of these diplomatic negotiations and so I would not characterize as a significant increase in those tensions.\xc2\xa0 Those tensions over those issues have been in place for quite some time, and they are serious.\xc2\xa0 And they are certainly tensions that this administration takes seriously.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they are part of what makes it so important that we prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; that a nuclear-armed Iran would be more dangerous when they menace Israel.\xc2\xa0 A nuclear-armed Iran would make it more dangerous when they support terrorism around the globe.\xc2\xa0 A nuclear-armed Iran, when they engage in destabilizing activity, would only be even more destabilizing.</p>\n<p>So that is why we have placed such a premium on succeeding in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the likelihood of a deal being reached, is it still less than 50/50?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still, at best, 50/50.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the odds that I have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline, and those odds have not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on Israel, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the ambassador to the U.S. meeting with some Democrats, having dinner.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the Israelis saying things like things have been blown out of proportion.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration looking forward to a face-to-face meeting with someone high in that administration sometime soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings to announce.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President telephoned Prime Minister Netanyahu just last week, where they had a conversation, and the President, in the course of that telephone call, committed to keeping open the lines of communication both between the two leaders but also, just as importantly, between the national security officials in both countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s for a couple of reasons.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the U.S. commitment, under the leadership of President Obama, to unprecedented security cooperation between the U.S. and Israel remains.\xc2\xa0 And the President, as Prime Minister Netanyahu goes about the important work of forming a coalition government inside of Israel, wants to keep open a line of communication as that newly formed government begins to make policy decisions that the Prime Minister believes are in the best interest of Israel.</p>\n<p>The President has also made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to coordinate and communicate with Israel as the diplomatic progress with Iran is made or not made, as the case may be.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep them updated on the talks.\xc2\xa0 That will require conversations.\xc2\xa0 And those kinds of communications are indicative of the close relationship between the United States and our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And certainly, the alliance between the United States and Israel is strong and a priority for this administration.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s evidenced by our ongoing security cooperation and our commitment to continued cooperation on issues of mutual interest.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So a high-level with Dermer or with Netanyahu, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see that happening anytime soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like that that\xe2\x80\x99s been scheduled at this point, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional high-level conversations.</p>\n<p>Okay, let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Olivier.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 At this point, with just a few days left before the nominal deadline on the Iran political framework agreement, would you characterize the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement day-to-day?\xc2\xa0 How often is he being briefed?\xc2\xa0 Is he being asked for input on any of the core issues, anything like that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is receiving regular, at least daily, updates on the status of ongoing negotiations in Switzerland.\xc2\xa0 This is a priority for him.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why, again, I ran through the list of people who are participating in these talks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Secretary Kerry; Secretary Moniz, the Secretary of Energy; the Under Secretary at the State Department, Wendy Sherman -- so there are a lot of high-level U.S. officials who are engaged in these conversations and the President is being regularly updated on them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been asked to make a ruling -- I\'m not going to ask you what specific issue, but has he been called upon to make a ruling on a point of contention?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of anything like that.\xc2\xa0 I think that there is -- obviously those updates that he receives are substantive and there has been the occasion for the President to communicate with that team about his views of the status of the talks.\xc2\xa0 So there is a useful back-and-forth, I guess, to the extent that these conversations aren\xe2\x80\x99t just one way.\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that that will continue over the weekend as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one for you.\xc2\xa0 Timetable is still end of March -- in other words, Tuesday at midnight, whichever time zone we\xe2\x80\x99re in?\xc2\xa0 Or are you --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to set up a countdown clock or something?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those are pretty in vogue these days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There all the rage.\xc2\xa0 In all seriousness, as you get down to these very hard -- some of these are very hard issues to nail down.\xc2\xa0 How open are you to extending this one day, two day, three day, and so on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Olivier, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the outcome at this point.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that the end of March is a firm deadline, and that\xe2\x80\x99s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year; that should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about highly complex, very difficult issues, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a particular surprise that we would expect these kinds of negotiations to take some time.\xc2\xa0 But surely more than a year should be enough time to at least reach a political agreement whereby all of the parties -- and essentially, in this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Iran -- can make some pretty specific commitments about the framework for a broader nuclear agreement.<br/>\n\tAnd we continue to be hopeful that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that will occur, but the likelihood of success hasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily changed.</p>\n<p>Victoria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You used the word, \xe2\x80\x9cspecific.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is one of the key issues here that the U.S. and the other five powers are wanting very specific language right now, and Iran is looking for fuzziness?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the nature of the conversations.\xc2\xa0 But I will say as a general matter that the United States and our P5+1 partners who are participating -- and this includes our allies in Europe, it also includes countries like China and Russia -- and what we are all seeking are specific commitments from Iran that would shut down every pathway to a bomb that Iran has, and would seek Iran\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to submit to intrusive inspections that can verify their compliance with the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking and we want those -- we intend for those commitments to be specific.</p>\n<p>Now, at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been clear that these conversations are highly technical.\xc2\xa0 And to ensure that the agreement is being fulfilled, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to seek some very specific technical commitments as well.\xc2\xa0 So after this completed -- if a completed -- if a political agreement can be completed by the deadline, that would essentially establish a framework for the kinds of technical talks that will require a few additional months.\xc2\xa0 And the deadline for those more technical talks would be the end of June.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, this is a situation where the devil is in the details, and being able to pin down those details is important, but where we need to start is with the outlines of a political agreement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are aiming to achieve by the end of March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a result of the call yesterday from President Rouhani and the letter that he wrote to the six world powers, and the talks with the foreign minister, and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing from Ayatollah Khomeini, would you say that at this point we\xe2\x80\x99re getting three messages that are the same, or are we getting three different messages from Iran of what they want in these talks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t at this point characterize any of the kinds of conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting from Iran.\xc2\xa0 We have confirmed that a letter was passed to the U.S. negotiating team that was intended for President Obama and was sent by President Rouhani.\xc2\xa0 I would confirm that that letter was received by the U.S. negotiating team in Switzerland, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details to share with you about the contents of that letter.</p>\n<p>What I can confirm for you, though, is that the P5+1 is united and the P5+1 is certainly speaking with one voice about what our expectations are about what a political agreement would look like if it can be reached by the end of March.\xc2\xa0 And that international unanimity of opinion has been critical to our ability to apply pressure to Iran and will actively contribute to the likelihood of success here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have succeeded in bringing the international community together to pressure Iran and to bring them to the negotiating table, and to engage in constructive talks that will prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s no small feat.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that when the President took office, the international community was fractured over this issue and there was unanimity of opinion inside of Iran about the benefits of pursuing a weaponized nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 Because of the leadership of this President and the steady diplomacy of his team, we have succeeded in uniting the international community around the goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We were able to compel Iran to participate in serious negotiations because of the way that we implemented a very stringent sanctions regime against Iran that led to a lot of economic pressure being applied on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And that has caused a lot of dissension within Iran about the wisdom of pursuing a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>And that, I think, is a pretty substantial reversal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the leadership of this President.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the way that the President views is the best way for us to try to resolve this particular situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as France having a tougher negotiating position at this point than the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s based on the conversation that President Obama had with President Hollande earlier this week in which they confirmed that they are of similar views about how to ensure that we are cutting off every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon and to ensure that Iran is making specific commitments about the kinds of intrusive inspections that will be conducted to verify their compliance with the agreement.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the Rouhani letter been received here?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I will say is I do feel confident that the team here at the White House is aware of the contents of the letter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Including the President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that work when they get a letter over there? Do they put it in a diplomatic pouch?\xc2\xa0 Do they open it up and email it?\xc2\xa0 Is it in English?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting question, and I have no idea.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get back to me?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe they send it over via Morse Code.\xc2\xa0 I have no idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They could it tweet it, too.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess they could do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Rouhani does tweet.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Direct message?\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the way that that letter is transmitted.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President is certainly aware of the contents of the letter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday with Stoltenberg, the NATO chief, what did she tell him about the reason he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the President?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, they had a conversation about a number of policies that the United States is working closely with NATO to pursue.\xc2\xa0 It was a useful discussion -- we put out a readout of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 In the context of that discussion, the National Security Advisor extended an invitation for the Secretary General to return to Washington in May to have a meeting with the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>I would also point out that the Secretary General had the opportunity to meet with new Defense Secretary Ash Carter, yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the kind of intensive coordination that exists between the United States and our NATO partners.</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We do know from some of the things that have been released and the phone calls, apparently, that Rouhani made that one of the things he wants is a quick removal of what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9cunjust sanctions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I know that the President has said on multiple occasions that it would be a much more gradual removal of those sanctions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any wiggle room in that?\xc2\xa0 Is there any consideration of changing that position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of negotiating this agreement from here.\xc2\xa0 But I will just say as a general matter that what you said about our negotiating position is accurate.\xc2\xa0 The President does believe that it would be unwise to, on the first day of an agreement with the Iranians, to take away all of the sanctions that have been in place for such a long time.</p>\n<p>What the President envisions is a phased waiving of the sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And there are sanctions that come from a variety of places.\xc2\xa0 There are sanctions from the U.N, executive sanctions that have been put in place, and, of course, the very onerous statutory sanctions that Congress has put in place.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that we need to verify Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement not just over the course of a few days, not just over the course of a few weeks, and not just over the course of a few months, but we need to see sustained, long-range compliance with the agreement before we start having a conversation about removing things like the statutory sanctions that have been so critically important to our success here.</p>\n<p>What is built into that sanctions regime is the ability of the President to waive some of those sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So there is a way for us to do this in a phased fashion over the course of time.\xc2\xa0 But the benefit of that approach is that if we detect any sort of variance in terms of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with the agreement, then we can snap those sanctions right back into place.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that we need to keep that framework for sanctions that Congress passed in place for a substantial period of time before Congress votes to remove them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can ask you just about the Middle East and the sharp rise in oil prices yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Most analysts -- obviously, Yemen is not a big producer, but they\xe2\x80\x99re a kind of small producer -- but there is some concern that long term, and the impact of instability in that region and the rising tensions could mean problems for oil prices.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder what the assessment or concern is at the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be well-positioned to give you a sophisticated analysis of the impact of the Middle East\xe2\x80\x99s stability on the global oil markets.\xc2\xa0 There might be some people who would want to take that role, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in that position.</p>\n<p>I will point out that we\xe2\x80\x99re keenly aware of this kind of volatility.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of volatility over the course of the last year that has prompted the price of oil on the global market to fall some 50 percent.</p>\n<p>But this is obviously -- we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the impact that this kind of instability has on -- could have on the oil market, and we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that this President has worked hard to pursue an approach here in this country that diversifies our sources of energy, both in terms of our domestic production of oil and gas, which is at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have, over the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office, increased the amount of energy that\xe2\x80\x99s produced by solar by 10 times.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve tripled the amount of energy that\xe2\x80\x99s produced by wind.\xc2\xa0 And we have made a concerted effort to improve energy efficiency in this country, all of which helps to make the U.S. and our economy less susceptible to that kind of volatility in the global oil market. But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we continue to be mindful of nonetheless.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius today announced at the U.N. that France would launch a new push for an Israel-Palestinian resolution that would, among other things, mentioned a two-state solution.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said a week ago at this podium that the U.S. would reevaluate its position at the U.N.\xc2\xa0 Would you be ready to support the French resolution on a two-state solution?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jerome, the thing I can say is that we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of the foreign minister\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 He was talking about his intention to move forward with a strategy at the U.N.\xc2\xa0 But we have not yet actually seen the text of a resolution, so I\xe2\x80\x99d reserve comment on a hypothetical resolution at this point.</p>\n<p>Byron.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Why was there no inspector general at the State Department during Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I know that at least one reporter at the Wall Street Journal has covered this issue closely.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is -- that I don\'t have much insight to share with you in terms of nominations that were considered or not considered.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that there was a functioning and even active inspector general operation in place at the State Department during Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s tenure there; that there were, as I recall, more than 400 inspector general reports that were issued during her time in office.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is an indication that there was an active, functioning Office of the Inspector General that was open and doing its important work while Secretary Clinton was leading the department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were also questions raised by independent groups as well as members of Congress about the independence of that inspector general and his relationship with State Department leadership.\xc2\xa0 Does that White House maintain that that was adequate enough oversight of the State Department at the time?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, based on the fact that we saw hundreds of reports generated by the Office of Inspector General, I think that we can reasonably assess that there was a vibrant inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office that was operating there.\xc2\xa0 And so whether that\'s -- there obviously are staff in that office that take very seriously their responsibility to be a good watchdog and to act independent of that agency\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0 That\'s their mandate; that\'s their responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And based on the fact they issued hundreds of reports while Secretary Clinton was in office, it\'s apparent that they fulfilled that duty.</p>\n<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that Congress in previous scenarios, even involving the State Department, has not been particularly -- has not taken particularly seriously the conclusions of genuinely independent investigations that have been conducted.\xc2\xa0 So I would remind you of the conclusions of the Accountability Review Board -- where you had somebody like Thomas Pickering, a very well-respected diplomatic, and Mike Mullen, who served as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was nominated to that job by President Bush -- who conducted a review of that department in light of the attacks in Benghazi -- that was a review that was criticized, and I think taken pretty lightly, by congressional Republicans.</p>\n<p>So I guess my point is, even if there had been an inspector general leading that particular office, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of confidence we can have that that individual would have been respected by members of Congress in the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I\'m a little skeptical of the notion that congressional Republicans are particularly concerned by that absence.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 Was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or any other State Department leadership official involved in any way in the decision not to put forward a nominee for five years?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Secretary Clinton about her views on that.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to an issue on the Hill and Harry Reid stepping down.\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you what is this White House hopeful for and in need of when it comes to a replacement for Harry Reid?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Majority.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was a good one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 White House spokesman Mark Knoller, everybody.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another softball.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that this White House would like to see a majority of Democrats in the United States Senate. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that Harry Reid has been a distinguished leader of the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 I understand that he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the longest-serving Democratic leaders in the history of that legislative body.\xc2\xa0 He is obviously somebody who served with remarkable distinction.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say in the past that so much of what this President has accomplished in Congress, particularly during his first two years in office, would not have been possible without the skilled leadership of Harry Reid.</p>\n<p>And that is one of the reasons that when Harry Reid does eventually leave office at the end of 2016, he will have a very long list of accomplishments that he will be able to point to.\xc2\xa0 And he should be justifiably proud of those accomplishments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the next Democratic leader, that will be a decision for the Democrats in the United States Senate and hopefully -- to paraphrase White House spokesman Mark Knoller -- (laughter) -- hopefully they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Democratic President to work with, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 In the past when the White House has somewhat from the sidelines chimed in and said what they were looking for in the next leader on the Hill for whatever position, they\xe2\x80\x99ve looked for someone with strength to fight.\xc2\xa0 Is that someone that\xe2\x80\x99s needed in the Senate right now and in this climate -- this political climate?\xc2\xa0 Someone who has the fortitude and the strength to fight against the GOP?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think if you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement about Senator Reid that we issued earlier today, that was the first line in the statement, was that Harry Reid is a fighter.\xc2\xa0 And there is no doubt that his tenacity and his skills benefited the country when he served in that position -- and as he has served in that position.\xc2\xa0 And over the course of the next 22 months, when both men continue to serve out the remainder of their terms, I\'m confident that they\xe2\x80\x99ll work closely together to advance the interests of middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m confident that Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to fight for his values and to fight for those priorities will benefit the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, I have to ask you this.\xc2\xa0 Loretta Lynch, anything there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, no.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re up to 139 days now.\xc2\xa0 And again, that represents and unconscionable delay on the part of Republicans who previously promised to consider her nomination in a timely fashion and to treat her fairly.\xc2\xa0 And on both those counts, I think that promise has been broken.</p>\n<p>All right.\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you brought up the Senate majority, you have a lame duck President and now a lame duck Senate minority leader.\xc2\xa0 To what effect will that have on the party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to regain the majority in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the election analysis to you guys.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we have seen, at least over the last several months, is a President who has really taken control of the United States Capitol and I think has been in a position where we have been driving the agenda in this town.\xc2\xa0 And everything that we see from congressional Republicans is largely a response to actions that this President has taken to move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 And I think that speaks to the power that is still being wielded by this President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much time will the President devote in his remaining years to creating a Senate Democratic majority?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously the President is interested in seeing a Democratic majority, he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in seeing a Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 But those elections are quite a ways off, and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to speculate about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President described his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu as businesslike.\xc2\xa0 Did he mean that?\xc2\xa0 Did he misspeak?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only reason I ask is because the only other person he describes a businesslike relationship with is Vladimir Putin. And I\'m seriously asking you if the President views Benjamin Netanyahu in the same light that he views Vladimir Putin?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not going to be in a position to try to dissect the relationship between the leaders of the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0 And I know that there is a lot of interest in this, in the media, and you guys are certainly welcome to consider that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the President, when he talked about this on Tuesday, was pretty clear that he believed that the relationship between our two countries was even more important.\xc2\xa0 And that relationship is characterized by open communication; it\xe2\x80\x99s characterized by very close security cooperation; and it\xe2\x80\x99s characterized by a commitment to shared values and ties between the people in our two countries that make Israel our most important ally in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m just using the President\xe2\x80\x99s own words.\xc2\xa0 And you often admonish us to take the President\xe2\x80\x99s words seriously and pay careful attention to them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked you the question.\xc2\xa0 Because his relationship with Putin has been strained, is strained, and is colored by an assessment of what Russia has done on the world stage.\xc2\xa0 And for the first time on Tuesday he used that exact same phraseology to describe the reelected Prime Minster of Israel.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just asking you if he equates the two, views them the same, views the relationship the same, because those are his words, not mine.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, I understand.\xc2\xa0 And the point that I\'m making is all you have to do is examine the relationship between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 The United States, as I just went through, has a very strong relationship with Israel because they are our closest ally in the Middle East, because we are committed to the kind of security cooperation that\xe2\x80\x99s essential to the security of the Israeli people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our relationship with Russia is much different and in many ways much more complicated.\xc2\xa0 We have serious concerns about the way that Russia has conducted themselves in Ukraine, but yet, we are working closely with Russia to hold Iran accountable and to ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of interesting consideration of the kind of relationship that we have with Russia.\xc2\xa0 But I guess I would make the case to you that that\xe2\x80\x99s much more important than the -- or even more important at least than the relationship between President Obama and President Putin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, again, I can understand sort of the interest in that.\xc2\xa0 But I think what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about is when the President is having these kinds of conversations with world leaders, he\xe2\x80\x99s doing so to advance the interests of the United States as it relates to our relations with these countries.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what our primary focus is on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting to Iran, not in pursuit of a countdown clock but simply clarity.\xc2\xa0 Is March 31st the absolute deadline, after which, if no agreement on a political framework is reached, all activity, all conversations cease?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have not talked at this point about what would happen if no agreement is reached after March 31st.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked a lot about how if it is clear that Iran is unwilling to reach a specific agreement that he would certainly consider additional sanctions being placed on Iran.\xc2\xa0 But all of that is going to require additional consultation with our P5+1 partners.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to require a consultation with our partners in the region and with our allies in the region.\xc2\xa0 And it will require some consultation with Congress, too, about what the approach moving forward will be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So at this point I\'m not going to speculate on that other than to say that these negotiations have been going on for more than a year, and while the terms of this discussion are complicated and important, that surely this is a political agreement that if we can reach one is one that we should be able to reach by the end of March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You helpfully described the three definitions of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 You have U.N., you have executive, and you have congressional.\xc2\xa0 Is it this administration\xe2\x80\x99s positions that if you achieve a political framework none of those sanctions ought to be lifted until after the technical conversations have reached their conclusion at the end of June?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that the way that this is structured is that the Joint Plan of Action would remain in place even if a political agreement is reached until the technical annexes can be finalized by the end of June.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no sanctions of any kind would be lifted until after that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 Because what we would be talking about is just keeping in place the Joint Plan of Action. And the reason I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this is because there are some sanctions that are waived under the Joint Plan of Action -- a very small amount -- but there are certain commitments that Iran has made in conjunction with that Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 That agreement would remain in place -- if a political agreement is reached at the end of March, the Joint Plan of Action would remain in place until the technical annexes can be negotiated.\xc2\xa0 And we would anticipate that those technical negotiations would be resolved by the end of June.</p>\n<p>Mary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try this one more time.\xc2\xa0 Is March 31st a hard deadline?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no?\xc2\xa0 Because it certainly sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out the possibility of an extension.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to leave you with that impression.\xc2\xa0 We are in a place where we believe that after more than a year of very difficult, complex negotiations, that agreement, if it can be reached, is one that should be reached by March 31st.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And earlier in the week, you were pretty firm in saying that Yemen remains a successful model for counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 Given the developments over the past few days, do you still believe that?\xc2\xa0 Any revision to your comments?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no revision to my comments.\xc2\xa0 And let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about why.</p>\n<p>The strategy that the administration has pursued in Yemen is not a nation-building strategy, it\xe2\x80\x99s a counterterrorism strategy. And if you evaluate that strategy over the last several years, you will see that because of the strategy that we have pursued, we succeeded in taking Anwar al-Awlaki off the battlefield in Yemen.</p>\n<p>There are a whole host of other extremist leaders who are actively plotting against the West or the United States that are less famous -- or less infamous, but yet have also been taken off the battlefield because of the efforts of the Yemeni government, because of the efforts of the United States and our partners in the region.</p>\n<p>There have also been a number of reports about plots that have been disrupted.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s at least one plot that emanated from Yemen to use the international air cargo system to carry out attacks on the U.S. homeland.\xc2\xa0 Because of the efforts of the United States and our partners and the Yemenis, that plot was disrupted.\xc2\xa0 Because of the efforts of the United States, our allies and the Yemenis, there was another plot that was related to the sophisticated bomb-making techniques of AQAP that was also famously thwarted in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And I feel confident in saying to you that there are other plots that have not been reported that have also been disrupted because of the success of the strategy that this administration has put in place in Yemen.</p>\n<p>That all said, what I also said earlier this week is that the significantly weakened state of the central government in Yemen does not enhance our counterterrorism efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that is why the United States is supportive of the U.N.-led effort to try to bring all of the sides who are in pretty stark disagreement in Yemen around the negotiating table to try to stabilize the situation in that country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s also why, or part of the reason why the United States has been supportive of Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries who have taken military action to try to bring the violence to an end in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 But Yemen has been a chaotic place for a long time, including in that situation where our counterterrorism strategy was being pursued that did succeed in taking any number of extremists off the battlefield and thwarting any number of plots that were planned in Yemen with an attempt to strike against the United States and our interests around the globe.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you respond, though, on that point, to John McCain and others who yesterday said that this is an example of the Saudis taking a lead and the U.S. leading from behind?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the U.S. involvement in the ongoing military operation that is being led by Saudi Arabia and their Gulf Coast -- or the Persian Gulf partners is a contribution that we\xe2\x80\x99re making at the specific request of the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 And the Saudis have a clear, vested interest there because they share a long border in the south with Yemen.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the security around that border, and they\xe2\x80\x99re taking action to protect their border.\xc2\xa0 And the United States, because of our close relationship with Saudi Arabia, is responding to a specific request to offer some assistance in that effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier, I think to Michelle, you had suggested that there was no connection between Iran backing the Houthi rebels in Yemen and their position there, and the nuclear talks.\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting you right, you were saying that you have a long list of grievances against Iran and you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to let them off the hook.\xc2\xa0 But today, at those nuclear talks, Zarif, the Iranian Foreign Minister said, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have condemned them\xe2\x80\x9d -- Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe they will only cause the loss of new life.\xc2\xa0 They have to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s saying this at the nuclear talks, Zarif.\xc2\xa0 Does that not suggest that the Iranians are tying the U.S. not getting more involved in Yemen, not pushing the Houthi rebels out?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s tying that directly to the nuclear deal -- don\xe2\x80\x99t push us here or you\xe2\x80\x99re going to spike the deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way that I perceive his remarks.\xc2\xa0 But again, we have been negotiating for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 And if Iran is serious about making these commitments, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to reach an agreement by the end of March.\xc2\xa0 And if they\xe2\x80\x99re not serious about making those kinds of agreements, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President continues to believe that resolving this situation through diplomacy -- diplomacy that would result in Iran not acquiring a nuclear weapon -- is clearly in the best interest of the United States.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interest of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.\xc2\xa0 And it happens to be in the best interest of our other partners in the region, including Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been so serious about pursuing this diplomacy over the course of the last year.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you still believe that Bowe Bergdahl served with honor and distinction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of commenting on an ongoing military justice investigation.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously complicated issues related to the chain of command because I\xe2\x80\x99m a representative of the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on the ongoing investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s underway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Susan Rice is also -- she reports to the Commander-in-Chief here at the White House as National Security Advisor.\xc2\xa0 And some months ago she went out and said he served with honor and distinction.\xc2\xa0 So was that a mistake?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, she was obviously commenting before any sort of military investigation had been conducted --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There were allegations that he was a deserter at that time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And so at this point, now that there is an ongoing military investigation into this matter, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to comment on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, in some of your comments over the last couple days, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said obviously a key principle -- and the President said this months ago at various news conferences -- is not leaving an American soldier behind on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clearly true.\xc2\xa0 What do you say, though, to the families of at least six American soldiers who are believed to have died -- who were killed trying to find someone who\xe2\x80\x99s now accused of being a deserter?\xc2\xa0 What do you say to their families?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say the same thing to them that I would say to all of the families across the country that paid such a dear price for the service of their loved ones in Afghanistan, which is that we deeply value their service and their commitment to this country.\xc2\xa0 They serve as an inspiration to all of us -- their willingness to put their lives on the line for their country and for their comrade.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that is worthy of our honor.\xc2\xa0 It is worthy of our deep appreciation.\xc2\xa0 And they certainly have that deep appreciation from everybody here at the White House.</p>\n<p>Jordan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh -- just one question.\xc2\xa0 Senator Rubio and Congressman Jordan offered a bill that would roll back much of the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws.\xc2\xa0 If that bill reaches the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk, would he veto it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the details of the legislation.\xc2\xa0 The President has been very clear about how he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for us to take a number of steps that would put in place measures that would prevent individuals who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t obtain a gun from being able to get one, while at the same time making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that is what the President is committed to, and the President is willing to work with anybody of either party who is willing to move in that direction.</p>\n<p>We have not, over the course of the last couple years, been able to make a lot of progress in that regard.\xc2\xa0 And that is, I think as the President has indicated on a number of occasions, a source of some disappointment here at the White House, because this should be a pretty common-sense step that we believe we can take.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately there\xe2\x80\x99s a majority of -- or at least a large number of members of Congress who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The District has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and this proposal would allow things like concealed carry.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House support any changes to the District\xe2\x80\x99s gun laws?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, gun laws that are made by the District of Columbia should be made by the District government.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we believe -- this is another principle that applies here, is that the home rule is important.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, we believe the District of Columbia should be able to make their own laws.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be meeting with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 Do you have sort of a preview of what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be talking about today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details about their conversation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Lew is going to be going to Beijing on Monday to meet with Chinese officials.\xc2\xa0 The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is an issue that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of isolated the U.S. from a lot of major partners that are joining the bank.\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense that the U.S. might shift its position and maybe reconsider?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any change in our position at this point.\xc2\xa0 But for more in Secretary Lew\xe2\x80\x99s trip, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to contact the Secretary of the Treasury.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And another question on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 At the upcoming Americas Summit there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be several dissidents that are going to be there.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the expectation that the President is going to meet with or at least see Raul Castro.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance that he may also meet with some of these dissidents and civil society members who are going to be there?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I am aware that some of those dissidents are planning to attend and participate in some of the conversations around the Summit of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule to share with you, though.\xc2\xa0 But in advance of the trip, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Nigeria is going to be holding their elections tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Boko Haram is threatening to disrupt the polls.\xc2\xa0 The polls have already been postponed once.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the President has a plan for what might happen if, worst case scenario, there is violence that breaks out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just tell you that as Nigeria looks ahead to presidential elections tomorrow and gubernatorial elections on April 11th, the United States reiterates our support for a credible, peaceful electoral process, the results of which reflect the will of the Nigerian people.</p>\n<p>We have been pleased to see the renewed agreement between President Jonathan and his primary challenger pledging not to resort to violence and to respect the outcome of a credible process.\xc2\xa0 This agreement reiterates the agreement they signed in mid-January at the urging of the United States, our international partners and the Nigerian people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is very much in the spirit of the message that President Obama issued earlier this week to the Nigerian people, whom he called upon to express their views peacefully and to reject the voices of those advocating violence.</p>\n<p>So we certainly continue to be gratified that Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership is encouraging the citizens of that country to participate in the election without resorting to violence.\xc2\xa0 We hope that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p>\n<p>JC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the Arabian Peninsula, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Saudi Ambassador to Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, told reporters that there was evidence that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard operatives and Hezbollah fighters had embedded with Houthi rebels in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 If this in fact is true, is this administration concerned?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment about the situation on the ground in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed our previous concerns about the destabilizing impact that Iran is having on this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have those concerns.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more.\xc2\xa0 How pleased is this administration, and the President specifically, that there is in fact coming together a coalition of the willing, Arab nations -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE -- who are very focused now on fighting the extremism and the crisis in the Arabian Peninsula area, especially Yemen?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, JC, what we are pleased -- or at least we understand, is that Saudi Arabia is taking this action because of the instability that\xe2\x80\x99s along their border, that that poses a threat to their security.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly makes sense that they would want to take action to try to enhance the security along their border.</p>\n<p>As a close partner of the United States, they have asked for our support for that mission in light of unique capabilities that the United States can leverage in situations like this.\xc2\xa0 The President agreed to that request, and there is some assistance that we\xe2\x80\x99re providing that\xe2\x80\x99s both logistical in nature but also relates to providing intelligence and giving them access to intelligence that might benefit their efforts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Egypt, as well, is now putting ships into the Gulf of Aden, as well.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there are a lot of Persian Gulf countries that are very mindful of the situation there.\xc2\xa0 And the United States is offering the support that\xe2\x80\x99s been requested by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Bob.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, let me try to take a line of questioning with some high-tech graphics, if you will.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re this close to an agreement with Iran -- (laughter) -- versus this close, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want that deadline to slide, especially since the Senate, I believe, is going to be out of town for a couple of weeks, and of course the critics are going to be scattered all over the country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bob, I don\xe2\x80\x99t envision a -- as I mentioned a couple of times now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been negotiating for more than a year.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and our partners all believe that if an agreement is able to be reached, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one that we should be able to reach at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 And that continues to be our goal.\xc2\xa0 It will require Iran to make some substantial, serious commitments in the context of those negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to see if that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Senate is going to be away.\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about suddenly people trying to slam new sanctions through quickly.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, that the Senate will not be in session.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it give you some buffer?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it give you some buffer, if you will, to slide?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it does or not, but it\xe2\x80\x99s our intention to hold all of the parties who are negotiating this agreement to the end-of-March deadline that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set.</p>\n<p>Jared, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the law signed by Governor Mike Pence in Indiana yesterday, the religious freedom law that was signed yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have seen that there are a number of private businesses and non-profit organizations that have said that the signing of this law prompts them to reconsider doing business in the state of Indiana.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including the Final Four next week?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, including the NCAA that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just hosting the Final Four in Indianapolis, but actually has their headquarters in Indianapolis.\xc2\xa0 All of those businesses and some of those who are considering having conventions in Indiana have raised concerns about whether or not all of their employees can count on being treated fairly in Indiana.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think that is a testament to the kind of reaction I think a lot of people all across the country had, which is that this step certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the signing of this bill doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like it\xe2\x80\x99s a step in the direction of equality and justice and liberty for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just the view of the administration; I know that\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the Republican mayor of Indianapolis and a whole host of non-profit and private sector companies who have legitimate concerns about the impact of this legislation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the proposed ballot initiative in California, Josh, that would allow the execution of a homosexual person?\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not going to be constitutional, and it looks like Attorney General Harris is going to be against it.\xc2\xa0 But has the President been made aware of this?\xc2\xa0 Is it something that he has a reaction to?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is the first I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing of it, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last thing, Josh.\xc2\xa0 This afternoon, Scott Kelly and a couple other cosmonauts are going up in space for a year.\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with science and technology people today, but I know this is usually the opportunity for the President to talk about science education.\xc2\xa0 And is there anything like that?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to be watching the launch?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be following as Commander Kelly spends the next year in space?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President -- this is obviously a subject that the President has been very interested in, particular this mission.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that Commander Kelly actually sat in the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s box during the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 And the President had the opportunity in the context of the State of the Union address to salute the heroism and courage of every member of this mission.</p>\n<p>So the President is obviously very interested in this mission and their success.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s proud of the accomplishments of these brave Americans who are engaged in this effort.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President will have an opportunity to watch the launch, but he certainly is aware of it and will be following the mission over the course of the next year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is an interesting opportunity for us to gain some new knowledge about the impact of prolonged space exploration on the human body.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- that\xe2\x80\x99s just one of the many things that they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at in the context of this mission, and it should be interesting.\xc2\xa0 And the President will certainly be following along like many Americans, I think.</p>\n<p>Let me just do a quick week ahead and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it a week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Connie, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to do the week ahead, which is that the -- on Saturday, the President will be traveling to Florida.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the weekend in Florida.\xc2\xa0 I do not anticipate that the President has the expectation of making any news while he\xe2\x80\x99s down there.\xc2\xa0 He will be accompanied by the pool.\xc2\xa0 And if news does occur, there will be colleagues of yours there to cover it.\xc2\xa0 The President will return to Washington on Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>On Monday, I think most of you know the President is planning to travel to Boston, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in the institute that\xe2\x80\x99s being established in Boston in honor of Secretary -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Senator Edward Kennedy.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the events there.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to deliver some remarks at that event.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for the rest of the week actually remains pretty fluid.\xc2\xa0 So as we get some more details updated on that early next week, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get you those details.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some more details on the schedule to hammer out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Have a great weekend, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:57 P.M.
