EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 So, two things.\xc2\xa0 For starters, President Obama spoke with President Carter.\xc2\xa0 Sounded like he was doing great, to the point where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get back on his book tour tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re all very encouraged by that news.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then secondly, I wanted to point you guys to my colleague Jennifer Psaki\xe2\x80\x99s blog post about the small business owner where the Republicans rolled out their pledge last week coming out with some pretty supportive comments about the small business bill that passed and was signed into law, that all those Republicans who were at his business voted against that day.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I\'m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, in the Rolling Stone interview, the President told Democrats to buck up and basically to stop whining, which is the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s words.\xc2\xa0 What is it that caused him to make those kind of comments?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s concerning him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is making an argument to Democrats that it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important that we focus on the choice that Americans have before them this November between the policies that have helped put us in the right direction and those that are going to go back to the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President is saying is a very practical -- what he\xe2\x80\x99s making is a very practical argument about making sure that people get out and vote, and that\xe2\x80\x99s in large part his -- what his comments to the students in Wisconsin are going to be today.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to say a lot of these young men and women are responsible for the fact that he won in 2008.\xc2\xa0 But this was never just about him winning.\xc2\xa0 It was about being able to make the kind of changes that the country so desperately needs right now.\xc2\xa0 And if folks sit on the sidelines, and if Republican leaders in Washington get more votes come this November, then the impact on the lives of Americans, from tax cuts to the strength of our schools to the strength of our economy, will be profound.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is trying to say we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot in this administration and a lot that we\xe2\x80\x99re proud of, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to be proud of our accomplishments.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require hard work to continue to move in the right direction, to continue to do the things that are going to keep our economy growing and creating jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that too many Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate or recognize these things that you guys have accomplished?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\xe2\x80\x99s his point.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t travel the country thinking about whether or not people are appreciating what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s doing the hard work of being President because he feels like there are certain policies that need to be enacted, there are certain things that need to be reversed in order to get our economy -- keep our country on the right track.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what the President is doing is making sure that people know, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re on the left or the right, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more to do.\xc2\xa0 And if you\xe2\x80\x99re on the left, if you\xe2\x80\x99re somebody like Keith Olbermann or Rachel Maddow or one of the folks who helps to keep our government honest and pushes and prods to make sure that folks are true to progressive values, then he thinks that those folks provide an invaluable service.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we need to focus our energy and our efforts on the choice that Americans have this fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he really think that message is going to rally voters, though, by telling Democrats to stop whining?\xc2\xa0 I think a lot of progressives have had kind of a backlash to those who come out strong against them.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I missed the last part of your question, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People are coming out against him -- him and Biden equally -- saying these sort of things, saying buck up and, you know, don\xe2\x80\x99t -- stop whining.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to rally voters?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to take a couple words out of a transcript and, you know, use them against any particular politician.\xc2\xa0 But if you look at the full arc of the argument --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Rolling Stone takes some arguments out of -- words out of context?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying if you ask about two words from a long answer about how the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on our political position is, I think that takes it out of context.\xc2\xa0 But what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you sympathetic to General McChrystal now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the arc of the President\xe2\x80\x99s argument was a much bigger one than just we need to buck up.\xc2\xa0 The argument was we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot at stake in this election.\xc2\xa0 And if folks don\xe2\x80\x99t go out and vote, then the changes are going to be profound.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should that have been made earlier, though?\xc2\xa0 Because right now a lot of it\xe2\x80\x99s, you know, selling the accomplishments, telling people, like today, what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done, what the administration has done with education.\xc2\xa0 But should that have been attempted earlier before the midterm elections?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 A lot of that work has been actually over the course of this last year.\xc2\xa0 But the point here is not necessarily just to go out and sell all the things that have been done.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s this choice about in November; what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen for our country moving forward?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to continue to keep moving with policies that are going to grow our economy or are we going to choose what the Republican leaders in Washington want to do, which is blow a huge $4 trillion hole in the budget in order to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President thinks we need to go in a different direction.\xc2\xa0 We need to be more fiscally responsible.\xc2\xa0 We need to keep our economy growing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to his chief of staff today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Not that I know of.\xc2\xa0 But they do speak most days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, yesterday the President said that Rahm didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell him -- hadn\xe2\x80\x99t said he made any decision.\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if the White House expects a different decision from Rahm, and if they expect a final decision from Rahm this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There are about a million ways to slice the salami.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news for you on Rahm Emanuel.\xc2\xa0 As a lot of the reports have indicated out there, in fact a lot of the reports that you guys have written, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a decision pretty soon.\xc2\xa0 But right now, Rahm is focused on making sure that the White House is run the most effective way possible for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did you pick the backyard to pick apart the Republican Pledge to America?\xc2\xa0 Why this setting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is -- well, the President has been having a very long conversation with the American people ever since his campaign started.\xc2\xa0 And these backyard events have allowed him to have a full conversation that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just 30-second answers, but are instead questions and discussions with neighbors and regular Americans all over the country about issues that are important to him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you looked at the event today and all these events, you get a lot of questions about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the economy, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with education.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s an effective way to have a back-and-forth conversation with the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the Middle East?\xc2\xa0 It looks like Abbas has decided to delay a decision on whether or not to leave talks.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have anything new on this?\xc2\xa0 Do you guys have anything knew on the settlement freeze?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously disappointed that the moratorium wasn\xe2\x80\x99t extended.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Mitchell is on his way to the region to continue talks.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep doing the hard work that we need to do in order to make progress on what is a very important issue for the folks in that region and all around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President getting any -- what kind of updates is he getting about some of the tighter House and Senate and gubernatorial races around the country?\xc2\xa0 Does he have sort of a regular update?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 He gets briefed on a regular basis about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening around the country.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I know previously we\xe2\x80\x99ve had presidents who really dig down deep into poll numbers and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening across tabs and things like that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more focused on other issues over the course of his day, but he does keep track of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in some of the races all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who generally keeps him up to date or briefed on those races?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a function of what the political director does to do that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he watch the Bears game?\xc2\xa0 Did the full Bears game, did he watch it to the end?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m almost certain that he did.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not 100 percent certain.\xc2\xa0 He was very enthusiastic about the outcome this morning, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much of it he saw.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think Rahm Emanuel was also enthusiastic about the Bears outcome this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment about Rahm Emanuel watching the Bears game -- just haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to him about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also in the Rolling Stone article he indicated that the U.S. energy policy would be his top priority next year and that he\xe2\x80\x99d have to do it in chunks.\xc2\xa0 What does he mean by like maybe doing this, forming an energy policy in chunks versus something more comprehensive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on energy and the things that we need to do in order to get onto a path of a cleaner environment, take on global warming, and create jobs of the future -- so he was basically discussing what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do going forward.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a fully formed plan just yet on what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in the next legislative year.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things that are going to happen between now and January 1st, and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out the best way forward possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President put 20 percent down on his first home?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you get back to us on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, I appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the House is voting tomorrow on the China currency bill and the administration hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really spelled out a clear position on it.\xc2\xa0 What is it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We are of course reviewing all the different proposals that are in the -- that are before the House and Senate.\xc2\xa0 But I would encourage you to talk to Treasury about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One final thing on the deficit commission, this FBI investigation and Andy Stern.\xc2\xa0 Is Andy Stern still in good standing in terms of being a member of the deficit commission?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the reports about that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of information about what\xe2\x80\x99s actually happening.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get back to you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right.\xc2\xa0 Enjoy the rest of your flight.\xc2\xa0 Oh, you know what, I also wanted to mention a that key University of Wisconsin-Madison alum in the White House, Alyssa Mastromonaco -- I was trying make sure folks know who the White House -- Alyssa Mastromonaco.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:46 P.M.
