Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t**Please see below for a correction, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:50 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see a little jovial Friday afternoon spirit here in the Briefing Room.\xc2\xa0 As many of you know from the guidance last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m joined today by Brett McGurk.\xc2\xa0 Brett, as you know, is the Special Presidential Envoy to our coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Brett has periodically come to the Briefing Room to stand here at the podium and to give you an update on our efforts to counter ISIL -- not just in Iraq and in Syria but around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s here with an update.\xc2\xa0 The update that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be providing all of you is similar to the update that the President will receive when he convenes his national security team on Tuesday of next week.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President periodically every two or three weeks will do a meeting with his national security team to review progress and to consider any updates to our strategy.\xc2\xa0 So that meeting will be convened at the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 The usual assortment of national security officials will be joining him for that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And as usual, the President will have a statement at the conclusion of that meeting to give you a little sense about what was discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to Brett.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got some opening remarks and I believe even a visual aid here.\xc2\xa0 And then he\xe2\x80\x99ll stick around for 10 or 15 minutes to take questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, Brett, do you want to take it away?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be back here.\xc2\xa0 I think I was here some months ago, and I just want to give an update of where we are in this most complex, most challenging, and also most important campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the President addressed the American people back in September of 2014, he talked about our global campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And since then, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually made a lot of progress -- if you look at from where we were back then until now, and even from where we were when I last addressed you some months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I want to do is just kind of briefly how we analyze this most difficult challenge.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep in mind, before I talk about the progress, I want to put the caveat in -- this is one of the most challenging terrorist situations we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in some time.\xc2\xa0 Forty-thousand foreign fighters from all around the world have poured into Syria over the last four years -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an unprecedented challenge in terms of the types of numbers.\xc2\xa0 But to address it, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we had to build a global coalition to address it and shrink their overall territory in Iraq, Syria, and also Libya.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe analyze it in three dimensions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the core in Iraq and Syria -- this is their self-proclaimed kind of phony caliphate.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled now all around the world, and the common denominator when I asked leaders in various capitals what is it that\xe2\x80\x99s driving your young people to this movement -- the common denominator is this notion of a historic caliphate.\xc2\xa0 So we have to shrink the core, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that in some detail.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s the core.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen there are the global networks.\xc2\xa0 Those are the foreign fighter networks that feed the core in Iraq and Syria, the financial networks, and the propaganda networks.\xc2\xa0 And we are constantly, through a global coalition, every single day, squeezing and constricting those networks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI just came from the State Department, where I addressed 66 ambassadors and representatives from our coalition to talk about how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, particularly in that global network piece.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then they have seven affiliates around the world, self-proclaimed affiliates.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important that we not get too distracted about these -- many of them are preexisting terrorist groups, which we\xe2\x80\x99re already very much focused on, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on that, we have been pre-Daesh, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on them now, even after they\xe2\x80\x99re flying the black flag of ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in a situation like Libya, where we see ISIL sending some of its best leaders to Libya to set up an affiliate, we do get concerned, we focus on it, we target the leaders quite effectively and with precision, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 And we also work with the new government to begin to take back the territory that ISIL holds, and that is now very much underway.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me go through very briefly some of the indicators that we look at in terms of how we\xe2\x80\x99re doing against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll just kind of -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll allude to about eight of them because it shows where we are and where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber one, we look at the morale of their overall fighters and the overall force.\xc2\xa0 And the morale now, compared to where it was even four or five months ago, is plummeting.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing them execute their own fighters on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re seeing them unable to move fighters around the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the recruits fall off precipitously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEven if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it from me, look at their own statements and what they say to their own potential recruits.\xc2\xa0 Their spokesman is a terrorist named Mohammad al-Adnani.\xc2\xa0 He has talked for years about this movement as one as a global, historic, expanding movement.\xc2\xa0 Every single thing they would say in their propaganda is that we are going to retain and expand our territories -- constantly going to expand.\xc2\xa0 If you look back a year ago, their propaganda was these black flags kind of taking over the Middle East and moving into southern Europe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHis last statement about three weeks ago was very different.\xc2\xa0 He actually said, you know, we might lose Raqqa, we might lose Mosul -- which they will -- and we might lose Sirte, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still going to be around so come join us anyway.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a very different message than what we were hearing, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one that is not quite as appealing to their potential recruits.\xc2\xa0 So the morale is plummeting, they\xe2\x80\x99re executing their own fighters.</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber two, their ability to hold territory.\xc2\xa0 They have not had a successful offensive operation, particularly in Iraq, in over a year.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve lost about 50 percent of their territory in Iraq, about 20 percent of their territory in Syria, and it\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to shrink.\xc2\xa0 But most importantly, is the strategic territory that they held is shrinking quite dramatically.\xc2\xa0 The border with Turkey is no longer accessible to them, and very significant towns in Iraq, such as Tikrit, Ramadi, Ar-Rutbah, going out in western Anbar Province -- no longer accessible to them.\xc2\xa0 And all the road connections between Raqqa and Mosul have been cut off.</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber three indicator:\xc2\xa0 Their access to combat-ready fighters:\xc2\xa0 How big is this organization?\xc2\xa0 We assessed back in December of 2014 they had as many as about 31,000 fighters in their ranks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now down, it\xe2\x80\x99s at the lowest historic point we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 We estimate -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get an exact number -- but between 19,000 and 25,000, and it\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to shrink quite rapidly.\xc2\xa0 Their ability to recruit and to move foreign fighters around the world, which is very important to protect all of our homelands is also much more difficult.\xc2\xa0 Since the President went to the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. General Assembly in 2014, and we passed a very historic U.N. Security Council Chapter 7 Resolution called 2178.\xc2\xa0 And that really shined the global spotlight on this problem.\xc2\xa0 Since then, and in working with our coalition, 45 countries have enacted laws to restrict the ability of foreign terrorist fighters to travel through their territory; 35 countries have made arrests and broken up cells.\xc2\xa0 And then through sharing information between different capitals, we learn more and more, and create a virtuous cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe now have information-sharing agreements with 50 countries all around the world to combat this, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely with Interpol.\xc2\xa0 Interpol is a critical partner of ours.\xc2\xa0 We have about 4,000 ISIL foreign fighter profiles in the Interpol database.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a 400 percent increase from when we started this in the fall of 2014.\xc2\xa0 It is much harder for these guys to travel and move around.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fourth indicator:\xc2\xa0 Their access to revenue.\xc2\xa0 Their revenue -- we think we\xe2\x80\x99ve cut off entirely their revenue that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the outside.\xc2\xa0 They rely entirely on self-generation -- oil, oil trade, sale of antiquities.\xc2\xa0 And we have systematically gone about with very good intelligence work throughout our whole government effort to target that.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve cut their salaries in half.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it before, we\xe2\x80\x99ve targeted their oil production efforts.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve targeted their trucks that move the oil around.\xc2\xa0 And they are no longer able to do what they used to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis, again, creates a virtuous cycle.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve cut the pay to their fighters; the fighters don\xe2\x80\x99t want to remain in the organization; they desert; their morale plummets; they can\xe2\x80\x99t fight -- and then we can defeat them on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>\n\tA fifth indicator is their access to borders.\xc2\xa0 When we started this, they controlled almost the entire Syrian border with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now down to about a 98-kilometer stretch of territory, and that is shrinking rapidly, particularly with an ongoing effort in Manbij, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about very briefly.</p>\n<p>\n\tSixth, they\xe2\x80\x99re capable -- they have capable and confident leaders.\xc2\xa0 This is an organization in which Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in the Ramadan in 2014, went into Mosul -- at the Grand Mosque in Mosul and said, we\xe2\x80\x99re establishing a caliphate.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from Baghdadi since late last year, and this is no longer a confident organization.\xc2\xa0 You can just see it in their own statements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo their leaders are not nearly as confident.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not nearly as capable.\xc2\xa0 And we are killing one of their senior or mid-level leaders once every three days now.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken out about 100 just over the last few months alone.\xc2\xa0 And this is because of the intelligence that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to gather from everything that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact that we have local actors on the ground, local forces on the ground working closely with us to gather intelligence, everything of course our military is doing in the skies over Iraq and Syria, and everything that our heroic Special Forces are doing, of course, on the ground in Iraq and Syria is creating this virtuous cycle.</p>\n<p>\n\tTheir media propaganda is not what it was before.\xc2\xa0 They had kind of open season back in 2014.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely throughout the global coalition to make sure that we get this stuff off Twitter, off Facebook, off YouTube.\xc2\xa0 We work very closely with Facebook and Twitter.\xc2\xa0 Twitter has taken down about *125,[000] pro-ISIL handles.\xc2\xa0 For every one on Twitter now there\xe2\x80\x99s about six counter-ISIL handles countering their messaging every day, 24/7.\xc2\xa0 Our partners in the coalition, the UAE has been a leader in this, the U.K., Malaysia, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a very localized message-based structure, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going at it every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, their global cohesion -- they see themselves as a global organization.\xc2\xa0 And their cohesion is shrinking.\xc2\xa0 Their connections between the heart of their so-called caliphate in Syria and Iraq to their co-called affiliates is drying up and shriveling up.\xc2\xa0 And even in their own propaganda -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to get into Syria now -- so they tell their recruits, maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t to Syria, think about going to Libya.\xc2\xa0 But Libya is also increasingly a not-very-hospitable environment for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if you think about Libya, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the news as much as Iraq and Syria, but just a few months ago there was no government in Libya.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s now a government backed by the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 That government is now on the ground in Tripoli.\xc2\xa0 Of course, it is working with local forces loyal to that government, which are now starting to push into the heart of what ISIL thought was its stronghold in Sirte, and they\xe2\x80\x99re making some real progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a lot of work to do in Libya.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of actors on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a core principle of ours that those actors need to recognize that civilian-led government, and from there, if the government of Libya, of course, requests help from the international community, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll find a very willing partner.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me very briefly just highlight just a few points on this map.\xc2\xa0 I referred to this map the last time I was here, and just to situate everyone, every color that is in this map are areas that ISIL at one point or another controlled.\xc2\xa0 So in the summer of 2014, all those colors -- they were moving down on Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 You might remember those days.\xc2\xa0 Everything in green are areas that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost since then.\xc2\xa0 Everything in orange are areas they still control.\xc2\xa0 And the very small splotches of dark red are areas that they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually gained.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis map only goes until the end of April, which is unfortunate, because since the end of April we\xe2\x80\x99ve launched a number of major offensive operations with our partners on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more green on this map now than there was in the end of April, and we hope to have an updated map coming out in the next week or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me just highlight a couple points on the map; I won\xe2\x80\x99t go through the whole thing.\xc2\xa0 But number one, that\xe2\x80\x99s the 98-kilometer strip of border with Turkey that I mentioned.\xc2\xa0 This is very important because it is the last strip of border it controls.\xc2\xa0 Turkey has done a great job in kind of sealing off the area on the Turkish side of the border, but until we take the territory away in Syria, we still remain vulnerable.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a city there, a town called Manbij.\xc2\xa0 Manbij is where we believe the Paris attackers, the Brussels attackers, they all kind of pulse through this area -- from Raqqa up to Manbij, and then out to the capitals where they had organized their attack.\xc2\xa0 So we have to work with forces on the ground to close out this area.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve pushed -- this is the Mara Line.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the extent of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s western advance, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with opposition groups to push to the east.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s proven to be very difficult because they have met with very fierce resistance from ISIL with suicide bombs and truck bombs.\xc2\xa0 So we opened a new front about a week ago, and this is going extremely well, a force called the Syrian Democratic Forces.\xc2\xa0 And the force that is doing this operation, there\xe2\x80\x99s about 3,500 of them.\xc2\xa0 And it is based upon a core principle that we set when we developed this strategy, and this was fundamental to the President, fundamental to our DOD campaign plan, and also the diplomatic strategy:\xc2\xa0 We want local people who know the local area to organize and liberate their areas.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want, obviously, American troops going into the streets and alleys of these towns.\xc2\xa0 We want local people with local knowledge to liberate their own territory.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when it comes to Manbij, there\xe2\x80\x99s an organization out called the Manbij Military Council.\xc2\xa0 There are about 3,500 fighters.\xc2\xa0 3,000 of them are local Arabs from Manbij.\xc2\xa0 I met some of their leaders when I was in Kobani, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve met them elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And they launched an operation about a week ago and crossed the Euphrates River here in what some of our Special Forces who work with these guys have said is one of the most complex military maneuvers they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in some time.\xc2\xa0 And they did it under fire.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve taken casualties.\xc2\xa0 In fact, one of the main leaders of this organization, of the military council, his name was Abu Layla, someone that I also met, was killed in the operation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve now named this operation after him, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve continued to advance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey continue to advance so rapidly that Manbij is now almost entirely surrounded.\xc2\xa0 And once Manbij is taken away from ISIL, it will really entirely cut off their ability to move from Raqqa and to move fighters, and to threaten us and to threaten our partners and our homelands.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important operation.\xc2\xa0 It launched about a week ago.\xc2\xa0 There was months of work that went into it.\xc2\xa0 They still have some ways to go, but we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on it and it is critically important.\xc2\xa0 And once we\xe2\x80\x99re in there, we think the amount of information we\xe2\x80\x99re able to get about ISIL, about the leadership networks will be very important for further unraveling it.</p>\n<p>\n\tRaqqa, just very quickly.\xc2\xa0 Raqqa, of course, remains their kind of their headquarters, and we think a lot of their leaders are still there, although fewer than there were.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to target those leaders in Raqqa, but, most importantly, the reason that the President made the decision to send additional Special Forces to Syria -- going from 50 to 300 -- is because we think we\xe2\x80\x99ve hit on a formula that works -- again, organizing local people to take the fight to ISIL combined with air support and combined with hard, kind of local political work that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 It works.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing to move down on Raqqa is recruiting and increasing the number of Arab fighters in their own territories.\xc2\xa0 So obviously, we have people on the ground helping to do that training.\xc2\xa0 And so far we think that is going quite well.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will just move around to number five.\xc2\xa0 That\'s, of course, Mosul.\xc2\xa0 The President has authorized additional military enablers for Mosul.\xc2\xa0 Those are getting in place, and I\xe2\x80\x99m very confident that when the decision comes to use then, they will be used quite effectively.\xc2\xa0 And that will be coming.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut also important for Mosul, we\'re doing a lot of diplomatic and political work within our coalition to make sure that the humanitarian, the stabilization piece, and the local politics is set up so that we do Mosul right.\xc2\xa0 Mosul is very complicated. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s about a million people still in Mosul.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s Arabs.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s different ethnicities.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that everybody is pulling together and working together.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere I give the government of Iraq a lot of credit.\xc2\xa0 They have allocated in their budget 15,000 local fighters from Ninawa Province to be part of the Mosul campaign.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working very closely with our Kurdish partners in Erbil, and of course, with the government of Baghdad to organize and coordinate this entire effort.\xc2\xa0 That is very much underway.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we won\xe2\x80\x99t put timeframes on it.\xc2\xa0 But we feel pretty good about how it\xe2\x80\x99s going to tick up.</p>\n<p>\n\tTikrit -- I mentioned Tikrit last time, but it\xe2\x80\x99s important because it\xe2\x80\x99s so critical that as we\'re focused on defeating ISIL, we\'re not just focused on defeating them and not thinking of what comes next.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on the day after ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is where as our global coalition we\'ve done -- we\'ve been able to pool resources.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve hit on a very effective mechanism, which has really revolutionized the kind of post-conflict stabilization effort.\xc2\xa0 Returning people to their homes after a conflict like this is one of the hardest things to do historically.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve looked historically.\xc2\xa0 It can take years, if ever.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Tikrit -- Tikrit, of course, is an iconic Sunni city in the heart of a mixed province, Salah ad Din Province.\xc2\xa0 The entire population now -- 95 percent of the population, according to the U.N. statistics, has returned to the city of Tikrit.\xc2\xa0 And that is because we have a stabilization funding mechanism through the coalition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s funded about $100 million at any given time, so that it\xe2\x80\x99s able -- you can draw from it and flush resources to the local level.\xc2\xa0 The government of Iraq is determined to decentralize authority as much as possible to provincial officials.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re working to make sure that local people are organized to secure the streets.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in Tikrit now, security is being provided by local police, which eventually gives people the confidence to come home.\xc2\xa0 And once they start coming home, you reach a tipping point and the population returns.\xc2\xa0 So in Tikrit that is going very well.\xc2\xa0 The entire population is back.\xc2\xa0 And in Iraq entirely now, about 700,000 people have come back to their homes.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is important because one of the main challenges in this part of the world, of course, are the refugees and migrant flows.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that as we defeat ISIL, we are setting the conditions for people to return to their homes.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinal point I\xe2\x80\x99ll mention is seven and eight.\xc2\xa0 Seven is the Euphrates Valley.\xc2\xa0 This would all be green if this was an updated map because we have worked very closely, again, with the local people to liberate their own territories.\xc2\xa0 And the tribes of Anbar Province, about 15,000 now, tribal fighters, organized to work with Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 And they have now cleared the entire Euphrates Valley from Ramadi up to Haditha.\xc2\xa0 And that is significant because it would not have been done if we didn\'t have the support of the local people.\xc2\xa0 And so that has now cleared out.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in Ramadi, we\'re trying to do the same thing as in Tikrit -- bringing people back to their homes.\xc2\xa0 We have about $25 million allocated for the stabilization effort in Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 We have 2,500 local police from Ramadi in the streets.\xc2\xa0 We have tribal fighters coordinating to control Ramadi, working very closely with the governor of Anbar Province.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat has made this very difficult -- and this is how barbaric ISIL is and why we have to wipe them off this map -- before they leave an area, before they left Ramadi, those who survived and retreated, they left IEDs, booby traps in almost every home.\xc2\xa0 So of the 70,000 people that returned to Ramadi, about 100 of them tragically were killed to find a booby trap in their closet or in their refrigerator. \xc2\xa0So the government stopped the returnees.\xc2\xa0 We then as a coalition -- we all met in Rome, with key contributors from the coalition -- we raised about $25 million to help the demining, the -- getting all these booby traps out of these homes.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s now experts, world-renowned experts on the ground in Ramadi helping to clear meter by meter to help people come back to their homes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of just how difficult this is.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of how every single detail we are really focused on.\xc2\xa0 And because we have a coalition, we can draw on resources rapidly to try to help.\xc2\xa0 So Ramadi right now they are clearing the booby traps and the IEDs to help people come back to their homes.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust to the southeast of Ramadi, of course, is Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 The Fallujah operation has been in the news, and this is very much ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Overall in Fallujah, we\'re focused on three dimensions.\xc2\xa0 One is military campaign, of course.\xc2\xa0 And this is being led to actually enter the city of Fallujah -- this is very important -- it is being led by the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi Counterterrorism Service, and local tribes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe overall force, about 20 percent, is local Anbari tribal fighters.\xc2\xa0 And entering the city, it will be primarily the Iraqi security forces and, ultimately, those tribal forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust yesterday, the Iraqi Special Forces punched through the main crunch -- the crust of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s defense and set up a foothold in the southern edge of the city in a very critical neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 And our military personnel who know this land better than anybody -- I was talking to Lieutenant General Frank McKenzie yesterday, who knows this ground, it\xe2\x80\x99s very significant to get that foothold and then to continue to push forward.\xc2\xa0 This will take weeks; it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be fast.\xc2\xa0 Again, they have to go block by block, clearing IEDs.\xc2\xa0 But we are helping the Iraqi security forces, as they operate under the Iraqi chain of command.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been reports of some isolated atrocities committed by some of the popular mobilization forces, primarily these are Shia volunteers who are in the outskirts of Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed this with Prime Minister Abadi.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed it throughout the government.\xc2\xa0 And so far, everybody is saying and doing the right thing to make sure that anyone who commits a human rights violation is held to account.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Iraqi security forces, as the IDP has come out, we did the same thing -- you have to screen who is coming out, do biometrics, make sure that Daesh is not infiltrating the IDP population, but this has to be done in an organized, coordinated way.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with the local leaders in Anbar, with the governor, to make sure that there is a local representative to try to make sure that this is going well.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on it, and the government of Iraq is also focused on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinal point before I just turn to questions.\xc2\xa0 Number eight is Ar-Rutbah, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all orange, but on the new map it would be green.\xc2\xa0 And this is way out there.\xc2\xa0 And this is where, in some cases, we\xe2\x80\x99re ahead of where we thought we would be.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a highway from Amman into Baghdad -- I was just in Amman a couple weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And that was about tens of millions of dollars of commerce coming through there every single month.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously dried up entirely since ISIL came in.\xc2\xa0 And the Iraqi security forces with, again, about a thousand local tribal fighters from the local area, cleared out ISIL from Ar-Rutbah just about two weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re now working to secure and open that highway, which is critical for our close partner, Jordan, and also, of course, for Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, you can see the pressure kind of coming from all directions.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Iraq and Syria, but it\xe2\x80\x99s global.\xc2\xa0 And I think, overall, while this remains a tremendous, tremendous challenge, the strategy is kicking into gear and we\xe2\x80\x99re making some progress.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk to the President next week about where we are and how we might further accelerate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Brett.\xc2\xa0 With the detail laid down there, so why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go around here?\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for doing this.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about Mosul.\xc2\xa0 You talked about the importance of having this be led by local forces, but how concerned are you about some of the Shia militias that, with Iranian support, are taking on a lot of the action?\xc2\xa0 And have you assessed the risk of there being a sectarian bloodbath against Sunnis that could have a backlash that would actually help the Islamic State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So Tikrit was kind of a test for this.\xc2\xa0 So Tikrit, we had -- this was about a year ago -- and you had a lot of popular mobilization units who are primarily Shia operating in that battle space.\xc2\xa0 We worked out a formula in which those units would not go into the city of Tikrit itself.\xc2\xa0 The units that we support, very importantly, all have to be operating strictly under Iraqi command and control.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 One, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to support any unit that is not operating strictly under Iraqi command and control.\xc2\xa0 And secondly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any mistakes.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell from the sky who is who.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo a lot of these units actually are operating under Iraqi command and control, they are disciplined, but there are a couple of exceptions and exceptions of units that the Iranians have tremendous influence over that are outside the Iraqi command structure.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a big problem for us, it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for the government of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 So we discussed this with the Iraqi authorities as early as -- just yesterday, I was talking to our ambassador, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a concern.\xc2\xa0 But, again, so far, the plan for Fallujah and who is entering the city are the Iraqi security forces operating under that command and control structure.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s a concern.\xc2\xa0 I will say that everybody -- if you know the Iraqi scene, I mean, the Grand Ayatollah Sistani, all the way down, even Muqtada al-Sadr -- everybody on the Shia side is saying the right things.\xc2\xa0 Any human rights violation is -- cannot -- everybody who violates anyone\xe2\x80\x99s human rights has to be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working here to liberate the people of Fallujah, who are Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember, is holding the entire population hostage -- anyone who leaves they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to kill.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so everybody is saying the right thing, but in a complicated environment like this, and in the smoke and dust of it, which we are in now, there will be incidents, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important, then, that the government holds the people accountable.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned, number four, the revenues of the Islamic State.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the estimate of the annual oil sales now?\xc2\xa0 And is that -- to what extent is it going down because the oil prices dropped or is it because of also airstrikes and the counter operation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 So we got real insider knowledge into their finances because of an operation our Special Forces did, again, over a year ago, deep into Syria, into the town Shaddadi, which is now no longer in ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\xc2\xa0 And it was an operation against Abu Sayyaf, who was a deputy to ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s main leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their main financier.\xc2\xa0 And our heroic Special Forces -- these guys are incredible -- they pulled more information off that site than any raid in their history.\xc2\xa0 We learned more about how they\xe2\x80\x99re funding themselves through that operation than anything else we had done.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey were generating about a billion dollars a year, about $500 million from oil and gas, and $500 million from antiquities trade, from extortion, from what they call taxes -- just extracting revenues off the population.\xc2\xa0 But based on that information from that raid, we were able to then systematically develop all that intelligence information, and working across the U.S. government into the military targeting process to go after how they\xe2\x80\x99re getting oil out of the ground and how they\xe2\x80\x99re selling it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced their production by at least 30 percent.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve substantially reduced their ability to generate revenue.\xc2\xa0 The numbers are fuzzy, so I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give you a precise number, but it continues to go down.\xc2\xa0 As we see them adapt, which we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing them do, we then get together and we go to the Situation Room with all the experts and say, how are we going to adapt and stay ahead of them, which we\'re going to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s because of -- this is why this is hard.\xc2\xa0 I mean, some say, well, how come you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have -- why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you just go after all their oil immediately?\xc2\xa0 You have to get the intelligence, the specific information about exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing so that the military effects can be precise and have the effect that you want.\xc2\xa0 And it was based upon that operation, deep into Syria, that we got the intelligence we needed to begin to really target their revenue streams, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be relentless in going after that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Justin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about Libya and, obviously, I think the question of what happens next.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been obvious success against ISIL there but there seems like the presence of factions continue to exist, General Haftar has not pledged allegiance to the central government.\xc2\xa0 And so what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan for after you\xe2\x80\x99re hopefully able to eradicate ISIS there?\xc2\xa0 And is the U.S. going to do more to help that central government?\xc2\xa0 Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen problems with basic services, basic finances -- sort of the core-of-government functions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so Libya, I think as you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously extremely complex.\xc2\xa0 And 10, 11 weeks ago, there was hardly any traction to say how are we actually going to grapple with this.\xc2\xa0 So, one, they formed a government, a U.N.-backed government, recognized by the international community -- a very important ministerial meeting held in Vienna in which the whole world really rallied to support that government.\xc2\xa0 There are elements on the ground exactly as you mentioned that have not yet recognized the authority of that government, and that remains a problem.\xc2\xa0 Our position is very clear that any armed actor on the field in Libya should recognize the authority of that civilian government, the Government of National Accord.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Kerry was in Abu Dhabi just a couple days ago talking about some of this, and of course we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to the Egyptians about this.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to obviously work with General Haftar under the umbrella of the Government of National Accord.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of discussions going on about this, and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re making some traction.\xc2\xa0 And my colleague at the State Department, our Special Envoy on Libya, Jonathan Winer, is, of course, working the political piece of this every single day together with the U.N. Special Representative Martin Kobler.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a lot of work to do in Libya, don\'t get me wrong.\xc2\xa0 But we now have I think some traction in how to go after it.\xc2\xa0 And those effects are now starting to be seen on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But it will take time, and we have to work it step by step.\xc2\xa0 But you\'re absolutely right, we want to make sure these armed actors come under a civilian umbrella.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll need the cooperation from our partners to make that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on Syria and one on Libya.\xc2\xa0 We saw earlier this week there were thousands of people fleeing Manbij ahead of the assault, which, as you know, the town is now surrounded.\xc2\xa0 What are you doing to help the people that are fleeing and to screen the people that are fleeing in case militants have infiltrated refugee flows?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So in Manbij, it\xe2\x80\x99s harder than some of what we\'re doing in Iraq, just because we don\'t have the access -- which we do from a place like Baghdad -- where we\'re working directly with the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I mentioned the Manbij Military Council.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a Manbij Provincial Authority, an authority from Manbij that will be ready to go in and to work locally to make sure they can work the stabilization piece.\xc2\xa0 The borders remain difficult.\xc2\xa0 We just reopened the border with northern -- the Kurdistan region of Iraq and into northern Syria to get a lot of this humanitarian relief flowing in.\xc2\xa0 That border is open for humanitarian trade, primarily for this reason -- to make sure that as areas are liberated from ISIL, the resources can be there to help people.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Manbij, you\'re right -- so we\'ve kind of -- completing the encirclement, and now the very difficult phase of actually liberating the city will begin.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t want to put a timeline on that, but we are working with local actors who have local knowledge and pooling the resources as best we can to make sure that we get the stabilization piece right.</p>\n<p>\n\tSyria is much harder, however, because we\'re not obviously working with a central government.\xc2\xa0 We are not going to work with the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 Period.\xc2\xa0 And so it presents different challenges than Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you look at what we\'ve done in terms of clearing out all this territory, I think we\'ve hit on a formula that works.\xc2\xa0 Manbij will be a big test.\xc2\xa0 It will be one of the most strategic blows to ISIL yet because it is their hub of foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 It is their main kind of access route from Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 And so I suspect they will fight for it.\xc2\xa0 But we feel pretty good about the plan -- not only the military plan, but importantly the post-ISIL plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And sorry, just on Libya.\xc2\xa0 The Misrata Brigades and some Libyan officials are saying that Sirte has basically fallen.\xc2\xa0 They\'re quite surprised that they\'ve gone and the forces are basically mopping up.\xc2\xa0 Is that your assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think they have some ways to go.\xc2\xa0 And I just don\'t want to get ahead of the situation because it remains pretty fluid, but we\'re encouraged by the progress they\'re making.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe understand the Government of National Accord set up an operations room to organize all these fighters who are fighting against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And in Libya a few months ago when I would do conferences, and they\xe2\x80\x99d talk -- analysts would talk about Libya, they\xe2\x80\x99d talk about this kind of hockey-stick growth of ISIL in Libya.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s remained static at about 5,000 total fighters.\xc2\xa0 Most of them are from North Africa or Sub Saharan Africa.\xc2\xa0 It has not grown, And that\'s because the Libyan people totally reject ISIL entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\'ve been able to control Sirte by force.\xc2\xa0 But once you have a credible force on the ground that moves against them, there is a chance that they could crack pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think we\'re there yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a clear read on what Baghdadi\xe2\x80\x99s status is?\xc2\xa0 You made a point of saying you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard from him in some time.\xc2\xa0 Is he alive and well?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us a timeline on the retaking of Raqqa?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So we have no reason to believe that Baghdadi is not still alive, but we have not heard from him since the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 It is Ramadan.\xc2\xa0 He purports to be the caliph; that\'s what he calls himself.\xc2\xa0 And so you would think he\xe2\x80\x99d be coming out with a statement to his so-called followers.\xc2\xa0 But we have not heard from him.\xc2\xa0 But we presume that he\xe2\x80\x99s still alive.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say, though, as I mentioned the leaders we\'re taking out, we are getting closer and closer and closer to the very core.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s really a matter of time for him.\xc2\xa0 I just can\'t put a timeline on any of the operations for Raqqa and Mosul.\xc2\xa0 Raqqa will be extremely difficult, but I think we have a pretty good plan after Manbij to organize these local actors, Arab fighters to move down and to isolate Raqqa.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I heard you correctly, you were saying that the problem is there were more atrocities perpetrated in Fallujah than you knew.\xc2\xa0 And all you have is to take the government of Baghdad at its word, that\xe2\x80\x99s saying everything -- we\'re doing the right thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese forces that -- there are several reports about summary executions from these popular mobilization forces.\xc2\xa0 How concerned are you that they are probably -- there are more reports, and that they are using this push against ISIS to engage in score settling with Sunnis and you\xe2\x80\x99re probably unwittingly supporting them in these acts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Most atrocities being committed in Fallujah are being committed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And ISIL is killing families as they\'re trying to leave Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s happening every single day.\xc2\xa0 There are Yazidi slaves inside Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 That is the vast bulk of the humanitarian violations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, we are very concerned about some of these reports by some of these militia groups that are outside on the outskirts of Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 And I would just say that even the leaders of these units have said this is totally unacceptable and they\'re going to hold people to account.\xc2\xa0 And they have to hold people to account, because these types of incidents play right into ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s overall narrative.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, we faced this in the early days of Tikrit, and there was all sorts of projections of what might go wrong.\xc2\xa0 We worked very hard with all the right actors to try to tamp things down.\xc2\xa0 I think that was pretty successful.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re doing in Fallujah right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say, the post-ISIL environment in a lot of these places is very chaotic.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a sectarian dimension potentially, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a kind of tribe-on-tribe dimension.\xc2\xa0 And it is really complex.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI told the story that last time I was here of a Yazidi who said, all I have left in my life is my revenge.\xc2\xa0 There is a lot of that.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon -- we\'re not on the ground in Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s incumbent upon the actors and the government and the religious leaders to say the right things, to issue the right instructions, and to hold people accountable.\xc2\xa0 So we are concerned about it, and we\'re talking to the right people almost 24/7 to try to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s handled appropriately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that the government of Baghdad shares your concerns, that these Sunnis when they see these acts, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t pushed further into the arms of these extremist groups?\xc2\xa0 If not ISIL, some other group that would replace ISIL in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 The government of Iraq certainly shares these concerns.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Abadi is going to Fallujah almost every other day.\xc2\xa0 And importantly he is bringing with him all the Sunni leadership of the country, the local leaders of Fallujah and Anbar province, and the national leaders in Baghdad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen I was in Baghdad about -- one of my trips recently, about six, seven weeks ago, I met with all the Anbari sheikhs, particularly in the area of eastern Anbar and Fallujah.\xc2\xa0 And the driving demand to get into Fallujah and to liberate the city was coming from the Sunnis of Anbar province and from these areas.\xc2\xa0 And so that is the plan.\xc2\xa0 The forces to enter the city, I mentioned about 20 percent of them are local Fallujans.\xc2\xa0 We\'re training the police to make sure the local police are controlling the streets afterwards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are these reports of isolated incidents, which everybody is concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And so, so far right now things seem to be relatively tamped down.\xc2\xa0 And we have to make sure it stays that way.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just put one plug for the coalition in terms of local police.\xc2\xa0 We are training now about 900 police leaders every three months.\xc2\xa0 It has been a real success.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s how we\'ve been able to get local people controlling the streets after ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re looking to triple that number by October.\xc2\xa0 That\'s one reason I met with the coalition today to talk about getting to that target.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you just say that those were local police?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, so we want -- the idea after ISIL is that in a place like Tikrit, we want people from Tikrit to be the police controlling the streets.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- yes, I just wanted quick clarification.\xc2\xa0 But my actual question is, in about two years now, of these people being hounded by a 60-plus-member Western coalition, we really haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the number of fighters go down all that much.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even been cut in half.\xc2\xa0 So can you describe what the foreign-fighter flow looks like right now?\xc2\xa0 How much of this 25,000-strong force are foreign fighters?\xc2\xa0 Are they still pouring over the border from Syria?\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could give us a sense of really how many fighters you think there have been in total since the beginning.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 The numbers are -- so that\xe2\x80\x99s why there\xe2\x80\x99s a range, 19,000 to -- but their ability to get fighters into Syria is dramatically restricted.\xc2\xa0 So our goal is to make sure that they can\xe2\x80\x99t get in, and once they\xe2\x80\x99re in, they\xe2\x80\x99re never going to get out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously still getting in, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard for them to get in.\xc2\xa0 So even in their own propaganda -- they have a magazine they release every couple of months called Dabiq Magazine.\xc2\xa0 And in their own propaganda, they say, hey, join our great organization, but maybe don\xe2\x80\x99t come to Syria, go to Libya.\xc2\xa0 And that was a sign that told us it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for these guys to get into Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know from all of our sources of information it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to get into Syria, and it\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly hard for them to get out.\xc2\xa0 We also know from Libya, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for them to get into Libya.\xc2\xa0 The 5,000 fighters in Libya, most of them are actually North Africans or from Sub-Saharan Africa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the numbers have gone down substantially.\xc2\xa0 Now, that said, as it\xe2\x80\x99s harder for them to get to Syria, what they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is to recruit local -- to inspire homegrown attacks.\xc2\xa0 So someone who\xe2\x80\x99s inspired over the Internet, rather than being recruited to come into Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to recruit them to conduct attacks at home.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve always done that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re increasingly trying to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different challenge, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we all have to focus on.\xc2\xa0 It will be with us for years.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why all of us in Washington, the whole government, but across this kind of global international community have to focus on it.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a very different problem than what we saw in Brussels or what we saw in Paris, which are attacks organized in Raqqa by very sophisticated leaders -- organized in Raqqa, and then they send the operatives out to carry out the attack.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, so long as they\xe2\x80\x99re pressured in Raqqa, they can\xe2\x80\x99t plan, they can\xe2\x80\x99t plot, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we want to keep the pressure on them constantly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these mostly foreign fighters still, though?\xc2\xa0 Has the sort of demographic of who these people now are changed much?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I mean, ISIL is made up of a bulk.\xc2\xa0 There are fighting forces all -- nearly all the suicide bombers, and they, in their own numbers, they claim to have done about 119 suicide bombs in May alone.\xc2\xa0 And nearly all the suicide bombers are foreign fighters.\xc2\xa0 And the suicide bombers are what gives them this kind of ruthless impact, both on the battlefield and against the civilian population.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of their rank and file, they\xe2\x80\x99re Syrians, they\xe2\x80\x99re Iraqis.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a decreasing number of those.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I think we have time for one more.\xc2\xa0 Richard, do you want to do the last one?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to tell us a little bit more about the contribution of the coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 You just talked about the training being given.\xc2\xa0 We can go through the daily round up by the NSC -- can you just tell us, as for the raids, is it mainly an American operation?\xc2\xa0 In percentage, can you say it\xe2\x80\x99s like 90 percent American raids and 10 percent -- and also, as for ground troops, are we getting to a point where we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask more ground troops from coalition partners to complete the job on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So the coalition is -- the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve organized the coalition, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go through it, but there\xe2\x80\x99s five lines of effort.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s military, there\xe2\x80\x99s countering foreign fighters, there\xe2\x80\x99s countering finance, there\xe2\x80\x99s countering propaganda, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the humanitarian stabilization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the military, it\xe2\x80\x99s about 12 coalition partners are conducting air -- helping on the overall military air campaign.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s strengthening and growing -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve added about four partners -- Belgium, France, others are now also conducting operations with the U.K. in Syria just over the last four or five months.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the Paris attacks -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you another statistic.\xc2\xa0 Since the Paris attacks, we\xe2\x80\x99ve increased the rate of strikes in Raqqa by about 100 percent, based upon additional resources from the coalition, additional support from the coalition.\xc2\xa0 About 20 coalition partners have forces on the ground doing training, doing advising and assisting.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not all U.S.; that is a real, truly coalition effort.\xc2\xa0 Even where our Special Forces are, we have a number of coalition partners together with our Special Forces.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re organized across these different working groups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tStabilization, which I mentioned, is led by Germany and the UAE.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- it\xe2\x80\x99s that working group -- they meet about every month at different parts around the world to basically make sure we have this stabilization, this post-ISIL piece going as best as we can.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the counter-messaging, I think I mentioned in my opening, it is U.K., Malaysia, UEA -- constant, 24/7 counter-messaging.\xc2\xa0 And a huge role there, of course, with our partners in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 Because there is a religious dimension to this that obviously we can\xe2\x80\x99t be the leaders on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re organized by the coalition through these multiple military, diplomatic and humanitarian lines of effort.\xc2\xa0 And we hope to have a meeting here in Washington over the coming months to really bring a lot of this together.\xc2\xa0 The last time we met was in Rome.\xc2\xa0 I think the coalition, having just met with all the leaders of the entire 66-member coalition, we have a coherent strategy, a coherent global campaign plan.\xc2\xa0 Every capital I\xe2\x80\x99m in now I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do a briefing of what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 Everybody knows exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s about how can we do this better and making sure that foreign fighters can\xe2\x80\x99t flow across borders, making sure we have the stabilization piece, making sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing the counter-propaganda -- all of which supports the military campaign -- is something that is now kind of -- we\xe2\x80\x99re in a virtuous cycle of how it\xe2\x80\x99s going.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that said, I close on a caveat I opened with:\xc2\xa0 This is a tremendous challenge.\xc2\xa0 These guys want to attack us.\xc2\xa0 They want to attack us every single day.\xc2\xa0 We have to remain vigilant, not just the United States of America but our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 And for the most part, we are, but of course, this is a challenge that will be with us for years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Brett.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nicely done.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate you coming.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have an opportunity to hear more from the President on this issue on Tuesday at the conclusion of the counter-ISIL meeting that he\xe2\x80\x99ll convene with his national security team at the Treasury Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken a lot of questions today but I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick around and take a few more.\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow expanded airstrikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan, does the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re once again focusing on the Taliban there as opposed to al Qaeda and other extremist groups like ISIS mean that the President will be more likely to approve allowing more than the 5,500 troops to stay at the end of his presidency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- for a variety of reasons that I will explain, I would encourage you to not try to interpret anything about a future potential decision on troop numbers with the new authorities that have been given to our forces who are already in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Let me explain to you why.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mission that our men and women in Afghanistan have been given and been conducting since 2015 is not any different today than it was yesterday.\xc2\xa0 This mission is focused on two things.\xc2\xa0 One is carrying out counterterrorism operations to protect the American people and our interests around the world.\xc2\xa0 The other mission is a very important one as well, and that is to offer train, advice and assistance to Afghan security forces that are working hard to provide security in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is now the responsibility, fully, of the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces to provide for the security of the nation of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the United States and our NATO partners can be and have been supporting them by offering training, advice and assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many situations, U.S. military personnel, and, in some situations, contributions from NATO forces have been accompanying Special Operations Afghan forces on some operations.\xc2\xa0 Those U.S. forces would not have a combat role per se, but rather would be offering advice and assistance even as these operations are being carried out.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat these authorities will allow is it will allow U.S. forces to engage in similar efforts to accompany conventional Afghan security forces when they undertake operations.\xc2\xa0 What this would allow is U.S. forces to be more proactive in supporting conventional Afghan forces as they take the fight to the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 And this means, in some cases, offering close air support, or it means, in some cases, accompanying Afghan forces on the ground or in the air.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, to this point, U.S. forces and our NATO partners have, in some situations, been accompanying Afghan special operators.\xc2\xa0 This authority would allow U.S. forces to accompany conventional Afghan forces in certain situations, but when they\xe2\x80\x99re accompanying them, they continue to be -- remain focused on the advise-and-assist mission that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been carrying out now for almost two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just quickly, Senator Perdue speaking to the Faith and Freedom group this morning suggested as a prayer for the President the verse of Psalms that says \xe2\x80\x9cLet his days be few.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And in case your familiarity with Psalms is as lacking as mine is, the next verse of that goes \xe2\x80\x9cLet his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Would the President like an apology from the senator for that comment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did make note of Senator Perdue\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 As Senator Perdue considers whether or not an apology is appropriate, there are a variety of other Scripture he might consult.</p>\n<p>\n\tTim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Reuters reported that the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman is coming to Washington next week.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm whether the Crown Prince is meeting with President Obama?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of these reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about his potential travel or whether or not the details of his trip have been locked down at this point.\xc2\xa0 But once we have some more updated details about his trip and about what sort of interactions he\xe2\x80\x99ll have with the U.S. government, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide those.\xc2\xa0 But I would not anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have those today.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President told Jimmy Fallon he was happy that Trump is the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that Secretary Clinton can easily defeat the presumptive Republican nominee, Mr. Trump?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, John, the President on a number of occasions has now made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Democrats to run scared and to engage in this debate fully, and not to take the results for granted.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President made quite clear in the video that he released yesterday that he intends to be a forceful advocate for Secretary Clinton and the policies that this administration have been pursuing over the last seven and a half years, because he does view this as a choice facing the American people about whether or not the next President will be someone who is committed to policies that advance the interests of the middle class, that seek to advance the country\xe2\x80\x99s interests around the world by strengthening our alliances, or are we going to hand the keys to the White House to someone who is promising to tear down that progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is obviously an election that the President believes is a priority, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be engaged accordingly.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly will be making the case to Democrats, Republicans and independents across the country that the American people should consider this election a top priority as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s not taking the defeat of Donald Trump for granted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Another question, just a postscript on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senator Sanders.\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion of Senator Sanders addressing the Democratic Convention, as many robust Democratic candidates who were nominated have addressed the convention on prime time in the past?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a whole lot more details of their private conversation to share.\xc2\xa0 If it did come up, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident this was not something that they spent a lot of time discussing, primarily because the Democratic nominee is the individual who will be responsible for determining the program at the convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo presumably when -- if and when Senator Sanders and Secretary Clinton have an opportunity to meet, this will be on their agenda, but not something that President Obama would weigh in on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s open letter to the victim in this Stanford rape case talking about being \xe2\x80\x9cfilled with furious anger\xe2\x80\x9d over it.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that view?\xc2\xa0 And why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this furious anger translate into making some comment on what is sort of the glaring issue here -- well, one of the glaring issues here that\xe2\x80\x99s caused so much concern is the sentence itself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you have heard the President I think, on a number of occasions, talk about how serious he believes the matter of sexual assault and violence against women is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has made clear in a variety of these settings just how wrong sexual assault is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has made -- has stated unambiguously that there is no room for sexual assault or sexual harassment or violence against women in the United States military.\xc2\xa0 There is no room for any of that on college campuses.\xc2\xa0 And there surely is no room for that in our society.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been unequivocal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has been engaged in a number of efforts to combat sexual assault.\xc2\xa0 The President and the Vice President have teamed up together to advance the It\xe2\x80\x99s On Us campaign.\xc2\xa0 This is a grassroots effort to encourage men and women all across the country to take the It\xe2\x80\x99s On Us pledge, and that pledge essentially is to intervene in situations in which the risk of sexual assault might be elevated -- if you observe a situation, even in a social setting, to intervene to try to prevent a sexual assault from occurring -- and that we all have a responsibility to protect our community, to protect the people around us, and to intervene in those situations in which something like this seems like to occur.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has quite strong feelings about this.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President does too.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President also has his own personal track record as a United States senator.\xc2\xa0 Of course, Vice President Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act, an historic piece of legislation that devoted significant resources to combatting violence against women all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is something that both the President and the Vice President have made a priority, not just because they believe that it matters as a policy matter, but because of their own deep personal conviction about how wrong sexual assault is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it was just surprising to see some of the words and phrases that the Vice President chose.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously he feels so strongly about this that he writes this open letter in that way.\xc2\xa0 So would you say that the President is also angry about the details surrounding this case?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair to say that the President feels strongly that every act of sexual assault and sexual violence and rape is wrong, and one that deserves a forceful rebuke to make clear to everyone that we have certain principles we have certain values in our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about any specific situation, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about the specific court decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but the obvious question is, when you say things like that -- \xe2\x80\x9cstrong feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d Biden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfurious anger,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeserves a forceful rebuke\xe2\x80\x9d -- the obvious question is, and what\xe2\x80\x99s angered so many people around America right now, is a six-month sentence a forceful rebuke?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Listen, this is a court proceeding, and a criminal court proceeding.\xc2\xa0 So I can\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on it.\xc2\xa0 But I think when I talk about a \xe2\x80\x9cforceful rebuke,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m making a clear reference to the fact that we need to just make clear to everybody that there\xe2\x80\x99s zero tolerance for sexual assault.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for directing violence towards women, or engaging in sexual activity without consent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no justification for it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no explaining your way out of it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s true in every setting.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A six-month sentence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like zero tolerance, though.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I just can\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on a specific decision that was handed down by a judge.\xc2\xa0 There are legal proceedings underway here so I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about any specific case.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I can talk in generalities about how there can and should be no tolerance for sexual activity without consent, no tolerance for violence against women, no tolerance for sexual harassment, no tolerance for rape.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments and feelings about this have been unambiguous.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, then just talking generally, would you say that there is not zero tolerance right there, given that somebody could get a six-month sentence for rape in America?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like zero tolerance.\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that we\xe2\x80\x99re not yet at a point where there is zero tolerance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s point is that anywhere in our society, when we see sexual violence taking place, it means we\xe2\x80\x99ve got work to do.\xc2\xa0 Even one instance of rape, even one instance of sexual assault is one too many.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that the President is going to accept.\xc2\xa0 There is no resignation on the part of the President and the Vice President that this is just something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with as a society.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we must confront seriously, and eradicate from our society.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no tolerance for it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no justification for it.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no explaining it away.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the goal of the It\xe2\x80\x99s On Us campaign is to make clear that we all have a responsibility for doing that.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that the President feels strongly about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, but given -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed so many strong feelings right now, repeatedly saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s zero tolerance.\xc2\xa0 So wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be a good time to speak out about a court case?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what would be the harm in that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as we had an opportunity to talk about a little bit yesterday, there is -- it is important that people who are responsible for conducting criminal investigations, people who are presiding over criminal proceedings, need to feel confident that they can do so without any sort of political interference.\xc2\xa0 They need to be guided by the facts and by the evidence, and by what the law says.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we avoid even the perception of a figure with significant political influence weighing in, trying to dictate or influence an outcome.\xc2\xa0 That would erode confidence in our system of justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I guess what I would do, Michelle -- as you consider this, just as a thought experiment -- is to consider if you had a President of the United States who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have such strong feelings about eradicating sexual assault, and you can imagine a scenario where if that individual also failed to abide by a long tradition of respecting an independent judiciary, you can imagine a situation where that person might feel like they can influence -- or can try to influence a judge who had imposed what that person considered to be too harsh a sentence. \xc2\xa0We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have any tolerance for that, either.\xc2\xa0 That certainly would erode our confidence in the justice system.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we need a justice system that operates independently, and one that -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way it can continue to have the confidence of the American people that everyone is subject to the rule of law, and the rule of law is applied fairly regardless of who you are, regardless of where you went to school, regardless of what political office you may hold.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And speaking of strong feelings, did the President sob at graduation, as he promised he would on many occasions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 When I walked out here, the President had not returned from graduation so I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to count the number of dirty Kleenexes he had stuffed in his pocket.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the past year, the Taliban in Afghanistan has made significant gains.\xc2\xa0 U.S. military commanders have testified on the Hill that the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating.\xc2\xa0 So is the President\xe2\x80\x99s decision now to expand military authorities in Afghanistan -- airstrikes and embedding now, again, with Afghan forces -- an acknowledgement that it was a mistake to put limits on those authorities in the first place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It was not, Jim.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the -- there continues to be concern about the security situation in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan is a dangerous country.\xc2\xa0 It has been for some time now, and it still is today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody, from the President on down, was under the illusion that after a couple of years of being responsible for the security situation of their own country, that the Afghan government and Afghan security forces would eliminate entirely the threat from the Taliban or any other extremists in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have seen, however, from Afghan security forces is a remarkable willingness to fight for their country.\xc2\xa0 The forces are resilient, even in those situations where they do encounter operational or even strategic setbacks.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a willingness on the part of the Afghan forces to reorganize and take the fight back to their adversaries.\xc2\xa0 And some of that is evidence of a successful effort on the part of the United States and our NATO partners to train Afghan forces, but some of that is also the built-in national pride of Afghan security forces to fight for their country and to counter the threat from extremists.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter all, when the Taliban carries out a bombing in Kabul or anywhere else in the country, most of the victims are Afghans.\xc2\xa0 So it makes sense that Afghan security forces would feel, as a point of national pride, a desire to eradicate those violent extremists from the midst of their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that resilience and that commitment to fighting for their country has shown on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 The question I think has simply been, what else can the United States do to support them in those efforts?\xc2\xa0 The President feels strongly that the Afghans must remain in control of the security situation in their own country.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. combat role in Afghanistan ended at the end of 2014, and the President is not considering restarting it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the question is, is it possible for us to be more proactive in supporting conventional Afghan security forces?\xc2\xa0 And we anticipate that by offering them more support in the form of advice and assistance, and occasionally accompanying them on their operations, that they are likely to be more effective on the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal that the United States has pledged for years now, which is to support the Afghan central government and support the Afghan security forces as they provide for the security situation in their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is expanding those authorities, however, not thrusting the U.S. military back into a combat role, direct combat role, in Afghanistan?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because they will be offering advice and assistance to Afghan forces, conventional Afghan forces --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not -- airstrikes are airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re combat operations.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not ground combat operations, but they are combat operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, there have been counterterrorism operations that have been undertaken by the United States forces and by --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the expansion of authorities, as I understand it, goes beyond what the rules were previously to go beyond the terrorism aspect and to attack large gatherings of Taliban who are not presenting a terrorist threat.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the authorities allow our forces to do is to provide the kind of advice and support that they have, up to this point, been previously providing to Afghan Special Forces.\xc2\xa0 Now they will be lending that assistance to conventional Afghan forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has been very clear about what their responsibilities are, and in some cases, this means providing some close air support, and in some cases this does mean accompanying Afghan forces on their mission.\xc2\xa0 But when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the operations that are underway on the ground, U.S. forces that are operating on the ground do not have a combat mission.\xc2\xa0 Those U.S. forces are there under a mission to offer advice and assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this conversation in the context of Iraq and Syria; it applies in Afghanistan too.\xc2\xa0 These forces are trained for combat.\xc2\xa0 They certainly are going to be armed for combat.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in a dangerous situation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re putting themselves at great risk to try to advance our efforts in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And that means that they are performing a remarkable service to this country.\xc2\xa0 They are aiding our national security.\xc2\xa0 We owe them a debt of gratitude.\xc2\xa0 But this is what they do willingly because they have been given orders by the President of the United States and by their Commander-in-Chief, and they\xe2\x80\x99re fulfilling them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everybody to understand exactly what those orders are.\xc2\xa0 For our forces that are operating on the ground, they have not been given a combat mission.\xc2\xa0 They have been given a mission to offer training, advice and assistance to Afghan security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether intended or not, like in Iraq and Syria, however, they could be drawn into a combat situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\xc2\xa0 And the President, when he spoke at Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day, noted the loss of American lives, both in Iraq and in Syria and in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t take for granted the remarkable courage that is displayed by American servicemembers on the battlefield in Afghanistan, and we certainly do owe them a deep debt of gratitude.\xc2\xa0 Because the work that they are doing there, as we learned painfully on 9/11, has a direct consequence on the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any time limit based on these new authorities?\xc2\xa0 Because earlier it seemed to me you were avoiding a question about whether the President would be able to reduce the number of forces down to 5,000 by the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 But that seems to indicate you expect this expanded authority to be over by the end of this year, because how could you possibly do it and still reduce the forces?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering these issues for a long time in more detail than I have.\xc2\xa0 What my understanding is, is that even -- that if the plan to draw down U.S. forces to 5,500 by the end of this year moves forward, that would still be a sufficient -- at a sufficient level to carry out these expanded authorities where necessary.\xc2\xa0 So the point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make is, just because these expanded authorities have been authorized by the Commander-in-Chief, that does not limit in any way our ability to follow through with the plan to draw down our troops at a level of 5,500 troops by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tGary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in terms of the troop numbers without this military authority being there on the ground and actually seeing the extent to which it is implemented, how can we say at this point whether or not that 5,500 number of troops would, in fact, be adequate to carry out those operations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is what -- this is based on the briefing that I received from the Department of Defense that obviously you can consult with my colleagues over there.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding is that there is nothing about these expanded authorities that would prevent the drawdown of troops to the level -- to the 5,500 level by the end of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then along those lines, because the extent to which that is used is largely left to the commanders there on the ground --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- is there concern that if it is, in fact, heavily used, that it could end up leading to or resulting in an expanded footprint there on the ground, out of necessity?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think actually what our military commanders in Afghanistan have said about this is that their intent is to use these new authorities judiciously.\xc2\xa0 And the idea here is to put U.S. forces in a way -- in a position where they can be more proactively supportive of operations led by Afghan security forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But not in every situation, but in situations where our commanders on the ground, based on their knowledge of those forces, based on their knowledge of the terrain, based on their knowledge of the operation, can determine whether or not that kind of stepped-up assistance is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is something that our -- so when we talk about expanded authorities, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about authority that the President of the United States has granted to our commanders on the ground in Afghanistan to have somewhat more latitude in asking our forces and commanding our forces to carry out these advise-and-assist missions in support of Afghan-led efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, can you elaborate again -- I know you touched on it earlier -- but elaborate on how this is not a reversal, in terms of strategy and policy there in Afghanistan, for the U.S. military.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t forestall or prevent us moving forward on the strategy that the President laid out last for drawing down our troop levels to 5,500 at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 This does not reflect a change in the basic mission that our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan are performing.\xc2\xa0 This is not a restarting of combat operations.\xc2\xa0 Those combat operations ended in 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what this is, is it does allow U.S. forces to provide the kind of advice and assistance to conventional Afghan security forces that, up to this point, have already been provided to Afghan Special Forces.\xc2\xa0 So that is some expanded authority.\xc2\xa0 We do anticipate that this could enhance the effectiveness of conventional Afghan security forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, these are decisions that will be made by U.S. commanders on the ground, but it does not change the basic mission.\xc2\xa0 It does not change the trajectory that the President laid out last year for troop levels.\xc2\xa0 But we do believe that it could enhance the performance of Afghan security forces that are fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because at the core, it seems like you\xe2\x80\x99re giving the U.S. forces more to do, with the idea of having less U.S. forces there on the ground to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way that I would describe it is we are actually giving our commanders on the ground the ability to decide to do more where it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it is not a change in our mission, but rather it gives them the opportunity to conduct this mission of advice and assistance in slightly more areas if our commanders have concluded that it\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they could conclude on a widespread basis that it is necessary to carry those out, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They potentially could conclude that, but they have indicated that that is not their intent at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the word \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d when you talked about future decisions that might be made on troop levels.\xc2\xa0 Are you just leaving the President negotiating room there -- maneuvering room?\xc2\xa0 Or are you suggesting that this is something that will be looked at?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is -- first of all, this is not a negotiation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief who will make a decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Maneuvering is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understood, I just --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- self-corrected.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not clarifying you, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not correcting you, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to clarify the record here, in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99s the Commander-in-Chief.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that he gets regular updates on this situation from members of his national security team, based here in Washington, and based at Central Command down in Tampa.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also get some advice from our commanders on the ground, and he will take that input and consider broader strategic decisions about the appropriate troop levels in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe current plan is for 9,800 servicemembers to remain in Afghanistan for most of this year, but to draw down that number to 5,500 by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 General Nicholson, who recently took command of operations in Afghanistan, has indicated that he was going to conduct a review of our efforts there.\xc2\xa0 And the President, at this point, has not received a specific recommendation to change the troop levels in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 But the President will certainly -- the point that I want to make, though, is -- the reason I bring that up is that the President is certainly interested in the advice from his commanders on the ground about the strategy moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99d consider it if that was the recommendation of the general?\xc2\xa0 Reconsider troop levels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to also ask you -- there was a letter published on this topic just a week or so ago by a number of prominent former military commanders, including General John Campbell, who just left command; General Petraeus -- a number of very top diplomats who had served this administration -- Ryan Crocker, Cunningham, a number of people.\xc2\xa0 And they were saying basically that this President needs to leave his successor room to make his or her own decision thus freeze at 9,800.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President is taking onboard?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what do you make of that, given that this President has said he was handed a lot of very difficult circumstances coming into office, when he looks at battlefields.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he appreciate giving his successor the decision of making the drawdown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is surely true is that President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s successor, regardless of who that person is, that person will be inheriting a situation in Afghanistan that is far improved from what President Obama inherited, both in terms of the security situation on the ground, but also in terms of the number of U.S. forces that are operating in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen President Obama took office, between Iraq and Afghanistan there were 180,000 U.S. troops on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Now, here in the last few months of the Obama presidency, the combined number of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan is about 15,000.\xc2\xa0 So less than 10 percent of the troop levels that President Obama inherited.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, the security situation in Afghanistan is improved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s still a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not discounting the risk that our men and women in uniform take every single day to undertake this mission, but because of the strategic decisions that President Obama has made over the last seven years, we have succeeded in decimating core al Qaeda that was previously operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.\xc2\xa0 And we have an Afghan central government that is committed to the task of securing their country and is an effective partner with the United States in pursuing that goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the next President will inherit a much better situation in Afghanistan than the one that President Obama accepted.\xc2\xa0 But, look, when the President talked about -- last talked about troop numbers in Afghanistan -- I believe this was last fall -- I think the President made quite clear his thought process about designing a strategy for Afghanistan that would enhance the ability of the next Commander-in-Chief to succeed in implementing a strategy that makes the American people safer.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\'ve made tremendous progress in making the American people safer because of our efforts in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the President is very interested in making sure that the next President is somebody who is committed to building on that progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is an argument that you\'ve often heard me make in the context of the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very relevant and resonant in the context of the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 But it also directly applies to the situation in Afghanistan; that we\'ve made remarkable progress over the last seven years in making the American people safer, in improving the situation on the ground in Afghanistan, in drawing down troop levels from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly interested in making sure that the next President is somebody who is committed to building on that progress.\xc2\xa0 And that means the President wants the next President to inherit a situation in which we maintain our momentum forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this would be a political consideration or perhaps a conversation with the successor candidate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would not anticipate that the President will consult with the candidates for President as he is making this decision.\xc2\xa0 The President will be making this decision in consultation with his national security team in Washington and his military commanders in Tampa and on the ground in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Political -- is what I meant.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to predict at this point exactly what kinds of conversations would be taking place.\xc2\xa0 The President is interested in -- particularly when we get to a situation where there is a President-elect, the President would want to make sure that the President-elect understands what our strategy is and understands the strategy that we\'ve been pursuing based on the guidance of our military -- of his military commanders.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut over the next several months as the strategy is designed, the President will be relying on the advice of his national security team.</p>\n<p>\n\tKaren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just quick follow-up on Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a petition on Whitehouse.gov to impeach the judge in the Stanford sexual assault case.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s surpassed the 100,000 signatures for a White House response.\xc2\xa0 Will there be a White House response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There will be a White House response.\xc2\xa0 There is not one yet, but stay tuned.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you all get it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In October, last year, the President urged parties in the region to get the Taliban back to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 Does this decision reflect the reality that those talks -- the prospect of talks is dead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does not.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to urge actors in the region to be supportive of a Afghan-led reconciliation effort with the Taliban.</p>\n<p>\n\tA couple of weeks ago, the United States military took action in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region to take out the leader of the Taliban who was viewed as a significant impediment to the continuation of those talks.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to assess at this point what impact that will have on the direction of the talks.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to continue to encourage all parties to participate in that Afghan-led process.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, Justin, here, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, just a quick one.\xc2\xa0 I think you raised some eyebrows yesterday in your exchange with James when you referred to the FBI inquiry into Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s emails as a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They seemed to be largely eyebrows at my -- at the Republican National Committee headquarters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Clinton campaign has repeatedly said that this is not a criminal investigation.\xc2\xa0 It says it on her campaign website.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering did you sort of misspeak or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said is on a number of occasions that I have not been briefed by the Department of Justice about the investigation.\xc2\xa0 So questions about the nature of the investigation should be directed to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said that on many previous occasions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point that I was making is that the ongoing investigation at the Department of Justice is one that is being conducted independent of any sort of political interference, and any sort of -- the President has complete confidence that the individuals who are responsible for conducting that investigation -- these are career employees at the Department of Justice -- these are individuals who understand that they should not be swayed by anything that the President has to say.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President of the United States wants them -- and is confident that they will, in fact, pursue the facts, follow the evidence, and lead to a conclusion that is supported by the facts and the evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t know whether or not this is a criminal inquiry?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would have no insight into that because I\xe2\x80\x99m not getting any sort of briefings from the Department of Justice about that ongoing investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, as I mentioned, the President will convene his National Security Council over at the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 That afternoon, on Tuesday afternoon, the President will deliver remarks at the first ever United State of Women Summit to mark the progress made by and for women and girls domestically and internationally over the course of this administration and to discuss solutions to the challenges that they continue to face.\xc2\xa0 That evening the President will host a picnic for members of Congress at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Senator Perdue\xe2\x80\x99s attendance is still TBD.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But his invitation remains.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will travel to Green Bay, Wisconsin for a Hillary For America campaign event.\xc2\xa0 Additional details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Wisconsin will be made available in the coming days.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as we announced yesterday, on Friday, the President and the First Family will travel to Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico and Yosemite National Park in California.\xc2\xa0 Additional details about their travel to New Mexico and California will be made available early next week.\xc2\xa0 The President and the First Family will return to Washington on Sunday evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a graduation present?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for the President and the First Family to mark the centennial of our national park system.\xc2\xa0 So I suspect they\xe2\x80\x99ll have some fun.\xc2\xa0 But also it\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to symbolically acknowledge the important role that the U.S. government has in protecting some of the most beautiful vistas and territory in the country.\xc2\xa0 So the President and the First Lady are very much looking forward to the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a great weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:12 P.M.
