GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, everybody got their recorders and BlackBerries going?\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller, fire away.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to get yours out, Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought you were going to do this by BlackBerry.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t have mine up here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About the sinking of the South Korean naval ship, can you tell us what steps the White House is considering against North Korea, if any, in defense of its ally?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me first just talk broadly.\xc2\xa0 We have -- we\xe2\x80\x99re involved in and have carefully reviewed the results of the international investigation.\xc2\xa0 As I said in a statement last evening, the report is an objective and scientific evaluation of the evidence that points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the ship was sunk by a North Korean torpedo.</p>\n<p>Obviously we strongly condemn this act of aggression against the Republic of Korea, and send our condolences to those families of the 46 sailors that lost their lives.</p>\n<p>Obviously we are -- we have and enjoy an extremely strong and close relationship with the Republic of Korea, and we are in consultation with them as they contemplate their next steps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s next step?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in consultation directly with the South Koreans as they make their next set of decisions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it -- is the next step something that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 preference would be an international one or something --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that -- in addition to the South Koreans, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in touch with neighboring countries.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re been in touch with bodies of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- I\xe2\x80\x99d say that North Korea is a country that has, because of its actions over the past many years, isolated itself even further from the international community.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what resulted in a very strong set of sanctions last year.\xc2\xa0 And I think these -- this act of aggression, this clear violation of the armistice agreement further sets them back and further isolates them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say in some form or fashion that there will be consequences?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you, Ben, I think there are consequences already for the North Koreans.\xc2\xa0 Again, they\xe2\x80\x99re further isolated from the international community based on the steps that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken to isolate themselves.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on this.\xc2\xa0 To put this in perspective, North Korea is saying any retaliation would mean \xe2\x80\x9call-out war.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I just want to frame this the right way.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any real concern that this could actually lead to war?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into a series of hypotheticals except to reiterate the -- our strong consultation, as part of the involvement in this investigation as well as in discussions with the South Koreans about what\xe2\x80\x99s next.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow-up -- what does isolation mean?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up, too.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What is isolation --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the definition of isolation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken have led them to the point in which they don\xe2\x80\x99t share a very healthy relationship with virtually everybody in their region.\xc2\xa0 They have watched the international community align against the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken as it relates to their nuclear program, ballistic missiles, and now these actions.</p>\n<p>I think the quality of life of their citizens demonstrates that the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken have isolated them from the world community.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the next steps, Japan has said it would back a U.N. resolution.\xc2\xa0 Is that in the works?\xc2\xa0 Is that something the United States would be willing to take --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in consultation with a host of different entities, including the Security Council in the U.N. and working closely with the South Koreans.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean it\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of things that are on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into hypotheticals, but has South Korea given the United States any assurances that they won\xe2\x80\x99t take military action?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the private discussions that the two countries have had except to say they\xe2\x80\x99re in close consultation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some light on the announcement -- or not the announcement, the direction from the EPA to BP yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we -- I think first and foremost, we are seeing -- as a result of the scope and the size of the spill in the Gulf, we have seen a large quantity of dispersants used, primarily on the surface, some underneath the sea.\xc2\xa0 Monitoring and testing has continued to take place during that.\xc2\xa0 But as we move forward, the EPA believed best to use the least toxic dispersant, again, as we are into -- well into the fourth week of what has happened in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Even as we continue to monitor air and water quality, we have asked and are asking BP to be transparent about the measurements that it is taking as it relates to air and water quality.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be asking them to more publicly provide, as I talked about last week, the video that they may have of the structure on the floor of the sea.\xc2\xa0 This is -- again, even as EPA continues to monitor the area.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But BP was telling the public that the dispersant they were using was essentially soapsuds.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that the dispersant is actually not used in several Western countries because of its toxicity.\xc2\xa0 Should they have been using a different dispersant from the beginning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the dispersant that they\xe2\x80\x99re using is part of a broader list of approved dispersants.\xc2\xa0 Our feeling and the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is given the extent to which they are -- we are having to continue to use them, that to use the least toxic of those makes the most sense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a follow-up on the election victory of Joe Sestak the other night.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this makes four candidates that President Obama has endorsed -- Deeds, Corzine, Coakley, and Specter -- that have lost.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s 0-4 in terms of his campaigning for candidates.\xc2\xa0 Is that a concern at all of this administration, or the President, the political operation?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Sestak -- several months ago, I asked you on February 23rd if you could find out more about what Sestak said about the White House making him an offer to not run.\xc2\xa0 And I know that in March you said whatever conversations have been had are not problematic.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering since this has become an issue in Congressman Sestak\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and will likely be -- continue to be an issue, if you could -- if you want to put it to rest right now, what exactly was the conversation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you never -- you never really explained what the conversation was.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Then I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the White House offers a congressman a position in the administration in order to convince that congressman to not run for office --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve said a number of times that you would get something for us on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I did.\xc2\xa0 And I gave that answer in March, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you really think the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t have a right to know about what exactly the conversation was?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a quick follow on that, because yesterday Congressman Sestak was on CNN and said, in fact, that he was offered something.\xc2\xa0 He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say more, but he said he was offered a job.\xc2\xa0 Would you deny that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s correct?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what Jake asked me.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you can\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that a job was offered?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that because the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office said to, Robert?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On advice of the Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you seek more information?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t now, but why can\xe2\x80\x99t you -- it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying you don\xe2\x80\x99t -- you have no interest in getting information.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will just refer you to what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what does \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic\xe2\x80\x9d mean?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on BP -- when you answered Jake, you said we are asking BP to be more transparent about air quality, about how much oil is spilling out.\xc2\xa0 Asking is a lot different than what the Interior Secretary said this morning, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve said before from this podium, that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the boot on the throats of BP.\xc2\xa0 Asking them for -- why are you not demanding it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- I will provide you with the letter that will soon go out which, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, we are asking for them to provide the data, put it on a website, update that website daily, provide whatever access they have to video to both -- fully to the government and to the public.\xc2\xa0 We think that is what the company owes, again, both us and the American people as we work through our response and as the public has questions about their operations.</p>\n<p>I will say my guess, Ed, would be that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to want to hide that data, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll, based on this letter, provide it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yet this video you\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking for, the media has been asking for for days.\xc2\xa0 They released a small one, I think, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that you want.\xc2\xa0 Why does that give you --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which is why we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- why does that give them any credibility that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn it over?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think they will respond favorably to this letter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This morning a spokesman for BP, Mark Proegler, said that he now believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually spilling more than 5,000 barrels a day, but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say exactly how much.\xc2\xa0 And I think this gets back to the point -- these oceanographers were on the Hill testifying yesterday saying that this government, the Obama administration should be doing more to demand of the company this data and how much is really spilling out and how four weeks later could you not know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the letter -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons the letter is going, is to find out more information.\xc2\xa0 Ed, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you really think a letter is going to force the company -- I mean, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound very tough.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, let me -- well, do you have a better idea?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a boot on the throat --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Maybe we could -- maybe a story on CNN?\xc2\xa0 Ed, let me -- I think you heard the President say in the Rose Garden last Friday that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there are many different estimates.\xc2\xa0 NOAA is conducting testing through many different research vehicles on the degree to which -- and we now have evidence to believe that likely there is oil in the beginning of the loop current.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to find out the degree to which more of that will go into the loop current, how much.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s testing that\xe2\x80\x99s going on to determine the size and scope of underwater oil.\xc2\xa0 And there is -- we are having -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a group of people that are looking at the flow.</p>\n<p>It is, Ed, hard.\xc2\xa0 It is -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about an incident that is 5,000 feet below the surface of the sea for a well that is an additional four miles below that one-mile surface.\xc2\xa0 It is, as Thad Allen said, the first response that he has had to deal with at this level in 30 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would mention this:\xc2\xa0 Thad Allen was supposed to retire -- he is not.\xc2\xa0 He has agreed to stay on as the national incident coordinator, even as a new head of the Coast Guard will come and focus on those duties.\xc2\xa0 But Thad Allen said that in 30 years he\xe2\x80\x99s never been a part of one of these things that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see.</p>\n<p>So, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- there are people that are trying to figure out the best -- to the best of their ability the degree to which there\xe2\x80\x99s -- the flow, the rate of the leak, the size of the plume, continued air and water quality testing for what oil is leaking in, what the effect of the dispersants are, just as the EPA has always been testing air and water quality standards around the local berms.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can to try to stop that leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The very last thing is, the CEO of BP, Tony Hayward, said at the beginning of this he would not leave the country until this was fully dealt with.\xc2\xa0 And CNN was reporting last night that he\xe2\x80\x99s now leaving the country.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s planning to attend a board meeting in Europe, and there are even allegations he\xe2\x80\x99s going to some sort of a birthday party.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration going to stop him from leaving the scene of this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to -- I would have to get some more information on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer where the CEO believes, based on the headquarters being in Britain, whether he needs to be in Britain or not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but when you say you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the boot on the throat, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not literal, but are you -- (laughter) -- what are you really doing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I got loafers on, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving, even though --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- well, let\xe2\x80\x99s not oversimplify the fact that we think that somehow the CEO is controlling the robot that\xe2\x80\x99s going to stop -- I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a spokesperson for BP, so if you have a question for the activities of BP, there\xe2\x80\x99s many well-paid spokesmen --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the government oversight of BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t -- Ed, I just think that the notion that if -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the CEO of BP being on a ship somewhere in the Gulf is going to make a whole lot of difference.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the amount of oil coming out, obviously it was, 5,000 barrels a day -- that was the long-term estimate.\xc2\xa0 Now BP says they are siphoning off 5,000 barrels a day, but it is still gushing out.\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of how much --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated estimate.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- again, there are people that are looking at that.\xc2\xa0 I assume, quite frankly, there may be different estimates at different times.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they believe it is dramatically more than 5,000 barrels a day?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As Thad Allen said, our response is not predicated off of the flow.\xc2\xa0 It is predicated off of the notion that you have a catastrophic event.\xc2\xa0 And that catastrophic event has created a response on land and on sea to deal with whatever we face.\xc2\xa0 So there are certainly many reasons to find out the degree to which that flow is happening.\xc2\xa0 It has not in -- though, in any way, Chip, impeded or curtailed the response that we\xe2\x80\x99ve deployed.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s not a -- hey, there\xe2\x80\x99s a thousand-barrel-a-day response, now it\xe2\x80\x99s five, get this notebook out and check.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s always been a catastrophic response, and I think if you look at the updated sheet that goes out each night about the level of the response, you can see that it is meant to deploy something of this size -- understanding, Chip, we have, to the best of my ability, not faced -- certainly, the Valdez was a larger spill, but, again, a little bit different because, one, it\xe2\x80\x99s a different environment, and two, a different process where there\xe2\x80\x99s a fixed quantity.\xc2\xa0 This is unique and unprecedented.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are some scientists who believe it could be 2 to 3 million gallons a day coming out of there.\xc2\xa0 Is that a possibility in the eyes of the administration?\xc2\xa0 If so --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many -- well, what does that translate to in barrels?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In barrels -- darn good question.\xc2\xa0 Anybody have a calculator?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On your BlackBerry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it would dwarf the Valdez, if that is true.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Two to 3 million --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gallons a day.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 For how long?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s 11 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the beginning --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Already --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since the beginning, continuously.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Eleven -- I have some figures on my desk --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It would be a Valdez every two or three days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is that -- okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s not have a roomful of humanities majors doing math.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the mathematical admonition, which I think is well taken.\xc2\xa0 You know, again, Chip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated estimate.\xc2\xa0 I would say one of the reasons that we continue to do monitoring, NOAA continues to do monitoring of -- both at a -- and satellite pictures that are taken at a surface level and testing that\xe2\x80\x99s done at a subsea level, is to try as best as we can to understand just how big this is.\xc2\xa0 An Exxon Valdez every two days -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a scientist on this, but my rough belief is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I hate to venture into math, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s actually every three to four days because that was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But I do think -- again, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m way out of my technical depth, but my sense is that you would see far more of that on the surface if that were -- if we were looking at -- I mean, as I recall, the Exxon Valdez was several million barrels of oil in one event.\xc2\xa0 That would be -- again, my hunch is you\xe2\x80\x99d see just a lot more of that on the surface than you do right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the other issues that\xe2\x80\x99s going on here.\xc2\xa0 Some scientists believe that the reason BP is so big on the idea of using dispersants -- well, first of all, they say they believe that the oil can do just as much damage below the surface as it can do above the surface after being -- even after being dispersed.\xc2\xa0 They say the real reason BP wants to use dispersants is so the public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see it, so the TV cameras don\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\xc2\xa0 Has the administration looked into that argument or are they fully onboard with the use of dispersants?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- well, we have worked with BP in terms of, again, the water quality and subsea testing of the subsea dispersants which, when we first started this process, had not, to the degree to which we\xe2\x80\x99re doing it, been tried.\xc2\xa0 At that depth there also is -- there are natural processes that deal with some amount of oil.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that if it was doing -- if the rate was exponentially higher, that all of that could happen. Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s -- on the surface there\xe2\x80\x99s some evaporation that takes place in terms of some of that oil as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I do not believe -- again, the response isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for surface oil, so if it were leaking X thousand barrels of oil a day, but that was -- only half of that was getting to the surface doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t still have a problem that has to be dealt with inside the water column at a whole bunch of different depths.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure that the scenario of hiding it would necessarily be accomplished.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Barbara Boxer says there\xe2\x80\x99s been a cover-up on the amount of oil coming out and seems to be suggesting that government agencies are involved with BP --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the notion of a cover-up is ridiculous.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of this cleanup?\xc2\xa0 Is it BP or is it the federal government overseeing it, directing it --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 BP is responsible for and will be paying the bill for the cleanup.\xc2\xa0 The cleanup is obviously overseen by a whole host of federal agencies --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s unpack that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Understand -- let me explain this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because I think that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me unpack it a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Remember, the drilling decisions that are made are made by now a collection of bureaus that used to comprise MMS in the Department of Interior.\xc2\xa0 The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing part of that response.\xc2\xa0 Once oil hits land the Environmental Protection Agency would take over, as well as monitoring the and water.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of how do we stop the leak?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge of that, those ideas?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 BP with our oversight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Are you confident in BP since you\xe2\x80\x99ve entrusted this great task to it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the law entrusted this great task of it, Savannah.\xc2\xa0 But judged by the implication of your question, there\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the best and brightest minds in all of this government and in the scientific community and in the world of commerce are focused on this problem.\xc2\xa0 Everything that can be done is being done.\xc2\xa0 We have, as I said a minute ago, an unprecedented catastrophe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have a well that is leaking some amount of oil 5,000 feet below the surface.\xc2\xa0 The technical equipment to deal with that type of activity is not possessed by the federal government.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense does not have a submersible that can reach 5,000 feet with the mechanical arm power to do the types of things that BP and other oil companies buy equipment to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re kind of in this arranged marriage with BP on the cleanup?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s seems like a strained analogy.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would simply say what I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve said throughout this process:\xc2\xa0 They are responsible.\xc2\xa0 They will get the bill; the taxpayers won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s being overseen by -- as I just unpacked for you -- many elements of the federal government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing on the Sestak thing, so what you said in March was you knew -- you were aware of the facts and there was nothing problematic there.\xc2\xa0 So but here you won\xe2\x80\x99t confirm or deny, but that statement, just leaving it there, seems to tacitly acknowledge that something had been offered.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to unpack any more of that statement than I made in March.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so but the impression is left that there was something and you\xe2\x80\x99re comfortable with that.\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to clear that up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer to you what I said in March.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to North Korea, Robert, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used this isolated formulation before and you\xe2\x80\x99re part of a long list of spokespeople for various administrations that have used it.\xc2\xa0 Do you really think the North Koreans care about this?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s had no effect on them for decades.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s had -- I think to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s had no effect on them, if you look at their people, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I think when you have people that can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough to eat, it has most assuredly affected your ability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s our policy to punish their people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but we have sanctions, Chip, on the North Koreans, which if you have rational leadership generally lead to a change in --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the leaders -- the leaders who call the shots -- Kim -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about this, based on the -- based on this behavior.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t be a spokesperson for or get in the mind of the leader of North Korea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, based on you -- based on what you describe as an unacceptable behavior, this has been the same behavior that has a long track record.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t become any more acceptable, I can confirm that.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Korea, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a suggestion that the U.S. should put North Korea back on the list of countries that sponsor --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a process that is done at the State Department for that, and I would point you over to them on the criteria to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to comment on the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock market, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But what about the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock market.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the Dow has been down by as much as 350 points today.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of uncertainty -- the national jobless claims report, Europe, also reg reform.\xc2\xa0 What can the administration do to infuse some certainty into the marketplace?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be careful not to break my admonition of commenting on what happens on a day-to-day basis.\xc2\xa0 Let me take individually -- for instance, we saw a weekly increase in the number of jobless claims.\xc2\xa0 It is -- I think it is safe to say that those are numbers that, based on seasonality, have a tendency to jump around.\xc2\xa0 We saw an increase particularly in claims from two states that had experienced some severe weather, including Tennessee recently.\xc2\xa0 I think the four-week average for those claims was down, which generally is also a number that looked at -- looked at in order to smooth out some of those seasonal fluctuations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard others in the administration discuss continuing to take the steps that need to be taken to put the economy on a firmer foundation.\xc2\xa0 A committee passed out the President\xe2\x80\x99s small business lending initiative in order to move more credit to small businesses.\xc2\xa0 Other committees have worked through things like our retrofitting proposal.\xc2\xa0 And the President still believes those are necessary actions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got -- Europe is having to deal with the problems within Europe, and we continue to believe those are some tough steps that are going to have to be taken.</p>\n<p>In terms of financial reform, the President and the team here have a strong belief that we have to have some very tough rules going forward; that the type of activity that led to what happened in -- starting in 2007 and through 2008 can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to happen.\xc2\xa0 I actually think that provides some certainty, not just to the market but to investors and taxpayers that they\xe2\x80\x99re no longer going to be on the hook for the risky decisions of a very few at a very few large banks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as long as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t movement, that provides uncertainty --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we are coming to the conclusion of the Senate process.\xc2\xa0 And I ventured to guess earlier in the week that we\xe2\x80\x99d have something on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk in the very near future.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple policy things.\xc2\xa0 The extenders agreement that Congressman Levin and Senator Baucus announced this morning, are you familiar with it?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a position in favor of it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with Legislative Affairs.\xc2\xa0 I have heard some talk about it, but not an in-depth amount.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t have a formal position yet?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I will ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Governor Jindal has been appealing to the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite consideration of his request that he be allowed -- and others be allowed to build these barriers or these berms to protect.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe to the degree that\xe2\x80\x99s been briefed here where that process is, and is the administration sympathetic to that request, think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me check specifically with -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I assume that falls under the purview of EPA.\xc2\xa0 Every day, there is a call that happens with the five Gulf state governors to go through what is happening on the ground, the actions that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking to deal with the response -- both from an environmental and an economic -- both environmental and economic impacts.\xc2\xa0 I know that when you say has it been briefed here, I know that Governor Jindal has mentioned that on one of those calls.\xc2\xa0 I will check with EPA on where that is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The President in his Friday comments about the spill talked about the quantities of dispersants deployed, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t favorable or negative, but he did quantify that as part of the federal response.\xc2\xa0 Has there been data that the White House or BP has received in the last 24 to 48 hours that has raised significant concerns about toxicity issues?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just the amount that they\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to wonder about?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the original toxicity of what was being applied in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We continue to do testing.\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of any testing that has shifted the focus to a different dispersant.\xc2\xa0 Our viewpoint is given the sheer magnitude of what we\xe2\x80\x99re facing, and our reliance on -- both at a surface and a subsea level -- on those dispersants, that as a matter of practice, at this point, using the least toxic is the most optimal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you in any way quantify this event in South Korea in the history since the armistice?\xc2\xa0 By my calculation, the largest loss of South Korean life since the war was ended and the armistice was agreed to.\xc2\xa0 You said in remarks last night that you would -- the administration supports the South Koreans\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to obtain justice for the loss of these 46 South Korean sailors.\xc2\xa0 First of all, can you give the American people a sense of the magnitude, the gravity of this event and what you mean by obtaining justice for the loss of 46 South Korean sailors?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the second part, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re in close consultation with the South Koreans --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That can be defined by the South Koreans.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re -- in consultation with us.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that -- obviously, as I said earlier, we have a very strong relationship and are committed to their defense.\xc2\xa0 But I believe the South Koreans will be addressing the second part of that.</p>\n<p>Look, in terms of the magnitude of this, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a historian to go back through Korean relations, but, again, I think if -- I think the notion of a military event between two countries that has caused this type of loss of life is extremely troubling and is a deeply significant event in the history of those two countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple things on politics.\xc2\xa0 Will the President raise money for Barbara Boxer next week in California?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that is on the schedule, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the administration view Tim Burns as a Obama Democrat, as somebody who, now that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the House, can advance the Obama agenda?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Tim Burns?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Mark Critz.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I transposed the names.\xc2\xa0 Mark Critz.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t transpose the names, you -- I mean, you got the -- I think -- I will say this, Major, about the elections that we watched on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve said here many times that I doubt there are many in Congress that agree with each and every thing that the President agrees on.\xc2\xa0 We have the luxury of enjoying a party with a big tent.\xc2\xa0 I think that was proven in Pennsylvania 12 by somebody who, while doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with every one of the policy decisions or policy proposals of this administration, there are common values that we enjoy as members of the same party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think if you look at the events that have transpired in the Republican Party over the last -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go back 13 months -- Arlen Specter was running a Democratic primary largely because he was run out of his own party.\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 Charlie Crist went from, 18 months ago, being on the very short list of a Republican vice president to being run out of his own party.\xc2\xa0 And a Republican senator from Utah that was elected six years ago with 70 percent of the vote finishes third, receiving slightly more than a quarter of the convention vote to be renominated.</p>\n<p>I think if you look at the direction that both parties are going, we are happy to enjoy a large tent with common values but diverse viewpoints.\xc2\xa0 I think the Republican Party is having an internal battle with themselves and they\xe2\x80\x99re shrinking the size of their party.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you name the most significant issue where the President and Mr. Critz agree?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Strengthening the economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Robert, looks like there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be another cloture vote tonight on financial regulation, maybe then they could move very quickly if that happens to a final passage.\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about how significant the administration -- assuming that happens, when that happens -- how significant the administration sees that in the context of your achievement?\xc2\xa0 And obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s some more -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with the House and getting them together, but at some point do you go out and sell this thing to the American public?\xc2\xa0 It plays a big part in the elections this fall?\xc2\xa0 Talk a little bit about --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think it is -- I think, as you mentioned, Mike, when we get -- when cloture is invoked we\xe2\x80\x99ll be past a very big step toward final passage.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, I think you have two very good proposals on the House and Senate side.\xc2\xa0 We will have to mesh those two proposals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But you are going to have very strong rules of the road.\xc2\xa0 The Senate bill includes bringing derivatives out of the shadows and regulating them.\xc2\xa0 It includes -- both sides include very strong consumer protections, which in many ways is where middle-class families interact with the financial system -- getting an auto loan, getting a college loan, getting a credit card.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an enormously significant thing; the Volcker Rule, which limits the size and the scope of the activities that a bank can be involved in.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked a couple of times whether -- why is the President talking about financial reform; why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he talking about the economy?\xc2\xa0 Well, the lack of a set of strong rules is a big reason for why we\xe2\x80\x99re -- why we have experienced the economic downturn over the past several years that we have.\xc2\xa0 And putting rules in place that prevent that type of risky behavior from impacting the economy to the degree it has is a jobs issue and an economics issue.\xc2\xa0 I think it will play a very big role in what the President talks about over the next several weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I have no doubt that voters will have very clear decisions that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get to make in November about whether you supported -- whether you supported ensuring that the taxpayers never got the bill again for the risky decisions of Wall Street or whether you supported the risky decisions of Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 I think those are the votes that people will get a chance to make.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that the thing is very complicated, just because it deals with complicated financial --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that it is enormously complicated.\xc2\xa0 I will say, as I said a minute ago and the reason I talked about the consumer financial protection provisions, because, again, this is -- in many ways, this is where people intersect with the financial system.\xc2\xa0 I hazard to guess many of us don\xe2\x80\x99t deal in derivatives.\xc2\xa0 So -- Peter does -- (laughter) -- but just a little on the side.</p>\n<p>So, again, I think where you deal with the financial system, with a credit card -- with a credit card, with a loan to buy a car, to buy a house, to finance an education -- the type of protections that are there, those are tremendously significant based on the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s that intersection that happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I would ask you about derivatives, but -- (laughter) -- I have to be able to define it.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Abdullah, the former Afghan foreign minister and presidential candidate, is here in town just a week after President Karzai was here, but nobody from the administration will see him.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about why that would be.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will check with NSC on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, then that leads into my second question, which is that on Monday, our last chance with you, there were 10 questions you said that you would check with somebody on and get back to us on, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you had a chance to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was 10, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll go --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got a list.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, what are they?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s one?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One was, has the President read the Arizona law -- you said you would find out.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I said he -- I said --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you\xe2\x80\x99d asked for information about it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said ask for information about that.\xc2\xa0 He did in a meeting that we had before that, and he has read the law, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He read the law, okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s nine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Glass-Steagall amendment, you were going to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Glass-Steagall is -- the administration strongly believes that the Volcker Rule that limits the size and the scope of banks fully addresses what needs to happen in that area of financial reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to reimpose the Glass-Steagall because the Volcker Rule would take care of it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re really going to give him 11 questions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s following up on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just kidding.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April asked a great question the other day about who met with whom when it came to the civil rights groups and Elena Kagan.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I asked Josh to follow up on that, but I will follow up with Josh on following up with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Peter.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a question about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is great.\xc2\xa0 Can you do this every day?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the no-bid Halliburton contract.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I see our friend wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here to -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t here to illuminate us on the meaning of his question, but since I haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten the follow-up question on what his original question meant, I do not have an answer for the question he lacked a premise on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 I think it was Wendell who asked about the Center for Public Integrity report suggesting that BP -- was it two? -- two BP refineries were responsible for more than 90 percent of the flagrant violations.\xc2\xa0 You said you would check on it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That I have not checked on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll take that?\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 The West Point speech, you were going to look at and see if you could give us any more about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was going to ask about that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this counts as one of yours.\xc2\xa0 But -- no, the President has received -- is in the process of that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a draft of that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything additional for that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll let it go with this one, but I asked on Monday about whether Karzai had asked for a changed timetable on the operations or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I will-- again, you -- well, I think you had started your question out by saying that the -- it was your understanding that the operation -- the beginning of the operation in that had been delayed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s a report that says some aspect -- some of the military operations, not the whole thing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, I -- did you ask if that -- did you ask if it was some aspects or the whole thing?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I believe I read it correctly --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, how about you do this -- you go check on that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll go check on the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the transcript right here.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do you?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have to search for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is his iPad.\xc2\xa0 Okay, the McClatchy report --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He brought his iPad in.\xc2\xa0 Wow, that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of the military operations were going to be postponed until the fall.\xc2\xa0 And the question was, was that something that President Karzai had requested --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 That was your question, right?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the one I get the answer to.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yeah, that\xe2\x80\x99s the -- you buried the lead.\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to see the phrasing.\xc2\xa0 I believe you asked the -- I will check on whether Karzai -- I believe -- I thought the answer -- I thought the question had premised, had the entire operation been moved, but maybe I misunderstood.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you loop me in, too?\xc2\xa0 Our editors would be interested in the response --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Are you now piling on to Peter\xe2\x80\x99s question?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 That I think is eight, do you have two more?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I do, actually, you gave us -- (laughter) -- information about the MMS official who stepped down that you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris Oynes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would -- I will be happy to -- I think that was extensively covered in the newspaper.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I know, but you were going to give us your response to whether or not this was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This was a personal personnel decision that I understand that he made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then the last question --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which, again, I think most of you wrote about, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help TV.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I apologize.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the recovery was slowing, and you were going to look into that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not read the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s New York report on economic slowdown, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll print a copy and we can -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll share that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that Peter doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to do this every day, is there any way we could have like an organized system, where there\xe2\x80\x99s like a list of the questions you say you\xe2\x80\x99ll check on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That seemed calmly organized -- I love that.\xc2\xa0 I love that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Previous administrations would actually post responses for every --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, maybe -- could we do that?\xc2\xa0 Could we request that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We could.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your -- is there any reaction to the Salahis being stopped near -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, which do you prefer?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this one is -- you know, look, I heard about this last evening.\xc2\xa0 I shook my head.\xc2\xa0 Once again, the Salahis were not on the guest list.\xc2\xa0 At some point, that would provide a hint as to the degree to which you should show up.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were they trying to get in?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no information that they were trying to get in.\xc2\xa0 I think the Service has talked about stopping a car that had been seen repeatedly in the area.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President make them feel unwelcome at the Correspondents\xe2\x80\x99 Association Dinner with his comments?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m serious.\xc2\xa0 He made a joke about them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, if every time somebody makes a joke about somebody they take it that personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he made them feel uncomfortable, April.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t invited them to come to the White House.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s a level of discomfort that would chagrin them from attempting to come here.\xc2\xa0 I am reminded that it seems to me like their 15 minutes of fame were up almost six months ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some in Congress say it\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate for a foreign leader to come to the White House and to the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives and criticize American law, American state law, and the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 Was there anything inappropriate in what President Calder\xc3\xb3n raised yesterday about both the Arizona law and the guns?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- when you say \xe2\x80\x9csome people,\xe2\x80\x9d I don\xe2\x80\x99t know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Several members of Congress have issued statements today saying his comments were inappropriate.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, he is on Capitol Hill and I think they could take it up directly with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he said it there, too.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why they issued the statements.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, it seems to have not worked.\xc2\xa0 Ann, I would say that he has viewpoints on issues; some of those, as you heard yesterday -- related to the Arizona law -- are shared by the President, even as we all have to be mindful of and take steps to implement comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President feel that -- did Mrs. Obama tell the President all about her encounter with the school student yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that, to be honest with you.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, speaking of President Calder\xc3\xb3n, this morning in his address to Congress, he asked lawmakers to reinstate the assault weapons ban, something the President has supported in the past.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still support that and does he plan to lean on Congress to make progress?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would -- because the President largely got asked this question yesterday about both drugs and weapons moving across the border, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the answer that he gave about increased inspections on cargo that\xe2\x80\x99s moving from the north to the south.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I just really quick just follow on -- a while ago I asked if he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed -- (laughter) -- no, he took care of my other follow-up but I have one more about if he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed any opinion at all yet -- obviously the boycott is growing; people are joining.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any opinion?\xc2\xa0 He opposes the immigration law.\xc2\xa0 Does he support the boycott?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been pretty clear about the law.\xc2\xa0 I think he thinks that the effects of it are potentially quite harmful for many in this country.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard him speak specifically about that, except to laud during his Cinco de Mayo remarks the Phoenix Suns for the jerseys that they wore during that game.</p>\n<p>Christi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 On the proposal from the Iranians this week, is it your view that this slows up the drive toward sanctions?\xc2\xa0 I know that you guys are proceeding, but do you think there needs to be a pause to weigh the Iranian proposal before going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, we -- I think Susan Rice outlined a consensus proposal that the P5-plus-1 have worked on for many months, after the agreement and proposal that was discussed by the Iranians, the Turks and the Brazilians.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that the proposal that Iran says they\xe2\x80\x99ve entered into now is less than what they agreed to eight months ago.\xc2\xa0 They did not agree to, as they had in October, sit down with the P5-plus-1 to have a broader, fuller discussion about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 They have not agreed to provide unfettered access to nuclear facilities such as Qom.\xc2\xa0 And the proposal does not address in any form the increased enrichment that Iran said it was undertaking in order to provide material for their research reactor.</p>\n<p>So while we acknowledge and appreciate the efforts of the Turks and the Brazilians, I think it is important to understand that that agreement alone does not address -- or that proposal alone in its limited form does not fully address all of the concerns that the P5-plus-1 and the larger international community have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point to the things that Iran agreed to eight months ago that are left out of this proposal.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an effort afoot to get them to expand the parameters of their proposal?\xc2\xa0 For instance, did that come up in the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with Prime Minister Erdogan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have -- I will check on whether that came up with Prime Minister Erdogan or not.\xc2\xa0 Again, there are responsibilities that the Iranians have and that they must undertake.\xc2\xa0 While the proposal that was outlined on Monday would be a step in the right direction because of the amount of low-enriched uranium that would be transferred -- again, assuming that the Iranians kept up their end of the deal, which has not -- has almost never been the case -- we have had eight months of progression.\xc2\xa0 That progression has included increased enrichment.\xc2\xa0 And the proposal, again, fails to live up to even what they wanted to do just eight months ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any point then in getting the Turks and the Brazilians to try to press for some changes --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think the role that they -- again, I would again acknowledge the role that they played in trying to get Iran to live up to its obligations.\xc2\xa0 I think the international community, by releasing the consensus of the P5-plus-1 after that, understands that -- the international community understands that there is more that has to be done.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Earlier in the briefing in talking about the oil spill, you had said -- about the volume of the spill, you had said there are certainly many reasons to find out the degree to which that is happening.\xc2\xa0 Could you spell out what sort of the top, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, three or four reasons to want to know that is?\xc2\xa0 And then also, is the administration firmly committed to coming up once --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me say this, Margaret, and I will double-check this because I want to make sure that I\xe2\x80\x99m clear in understanding a portion of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and that is that there -- if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, there are some penalties that are derived from the amount.\xc2\xa0 But I want to make sure that that -- that what I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard is, in that way, correct.</p>\n<p>Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got scientists that are working on evaluating, testing, and setting a whole host of issues, from subsea oil, to loop current, to flow.\xc2\xa0 I guess my main answer was that our response efforts have not been predicated on a different flow --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but that I understand.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- or on a magnitude of that flow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But once -- the priority is to stop it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And everybody agrees that\xe2\x80\x99s the right priority.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration committed though at the end to coming up with an official sort of final number?\xc2\xa0 And are you concerned at all that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, again, I think that to some degree I would ask -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask a scientist whether that is -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s obtainable.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s my question is once it\xe2\x80\x99s out, can you go back and figure out how much came out?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.\xc2\xa0 I doubt we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the margin of error would be.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, one of the reasons that we know -- one of the reasons that you can predicate a question on the degree to which, or on the amount of oil that the Valdez spilled was because you had in a container in a ship a defined amount.\xc2\xa0 You have, again, several leaks coming from a structure and a pipe 5,000 feet below the surface.\xc2\xa0 And as I think Thad Allen has said, again, even the video that we see is two-dimensional.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing it on the screen, there\xe2\x80\x99s a depth that you would need, I assume, to make that measurement that is not completely apparent at first blush.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to keep going, but even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not the priority, it seems like it is increasingly a priority.\xc2\xa0 What are the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s changing --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think at some point you\xe2\x80\x99ll have -- again -- no, no.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anything is changing.\xc2\xa0 I think this is part of the response.\xc2\xa0 Again, I just -- without having the scientific background, again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which and with what accuracy you could come up with what that number is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in all honesty, I think if you go back and look at over a several-week period since the spill has happened, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen estimates -- and I think largely from reporting -- that have ranged each day by tens of thousands of barrels.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I think part of it would be the degree to which -- how accurate and how specific can you get, and I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the BP oil spill, and going to this last question, the sentiment out in the public is if this thing was built, why can\xe2\x80\x99t it be repaired, and what can\xe2\x80\x99t -- in an expeditious manner?\xc2\xa0 And why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the government acting in an expeditious manner to even go into the private sector to help rectify this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 April, the private sector is -- again, BP is an active member of the private sector and is working in conjunction, as I understand it, with many different oil companies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean -- the people that I\xe2\x80\x99m talking\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about just BP, not the people who are involved, but the people beyond them -- there are other ocean-type persons, marine-type persons, whatever -- (laughter) -- oceanographic, I guess, whatever, okay -- okay, whatever.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The decision I\xe2\x80\x99m contemplating in my head is to ask you, again, to be more specific as to said \xe2\x80\x9coceanographic\xe2\x80\x9d people, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be flip, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to figure out -- I mean, are you talking -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a scientific element to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the point they\xe2\x80\x99ll make.\xc2\xa0 People who have mechanisms to go down to be able to repair equipment, machinery --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I am being very clear -- with machinery as well as pods that you can go down in, robots --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 April, are you asking me or are you telling me that there is a -- there are a series of machines that -- no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be flip here.\xc2\xa0 But the predicate of your question is that there is -- hold on -- that there are a series of machines that exist that have not been deployed in order to deal with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening 5,000 feet below.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the question that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0 This is the question that\xe2\x80\x99s out there.\xc2\xa0 People want to -- if this thing could have been built that far down, it was built some kind of way, and there are machines and equipment --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s failed in a catastrophic way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but there are machines out there and other marine technology --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- private sector organizations that could be tapped by the federal government.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I want to be careful here, April.\xc2\xa0 I want to be careful because -- can I just, for a second?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I want to ask -- you\xe2\x80\x99re predicating your question on -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at whatever you have -- about the notion that there are a series of people or machines that could solve this that are somehow not being asked or used to solve this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my question that I\xe2\x80\x99m asking that we are getting, that people are saying, if this was built, if this could be built, and you could have siphoning of oil out of a well, as you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, four miles down, and then the actual equipment is a mile down, why not -- how can you not tap other resources out there -- marine technology resources -- to possibly help fix the problem?\xc2\xa0 Not just deal with BP and Halliburton group, deal with other people, tap other organizations.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to BP to get you a list of the people and entities that they\xe2\x80\x99re working in conjunction with in order to plug the hole.\xc2\xa0 But understand that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s where everybody is coming -- do you actually trust BP?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- you go to BP, go to BP.\xc2\xa0 Why not do something --going to BP.\xc2\xa0 Why not do something independent --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they have -- I do not think it is in their business model to continue to have the leak that they\xe2\x80\x99re having in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m under the strong impression that they have asked companies throughout the world that deal with these type of situations for technological and brainpower expertise in order to deal with this, because -- I mean, I think -- the larger point that I\xe2\x80\x99d make, April, is the equipment that is -- the equipment that\xe2\x80\x99s used to look at and deal with what is going on a mile beneath the surface, that\xe2\x80\x99s equipment that is owned and possessed by those companies that have an expertise in that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a federal government division of -- that has, as I said earlier, a submersible at 5,000 feet with the mechanical ability to lift many tons of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, you just tapped on in your answer basically the issue of trust with BP.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not giving out information on the video.\xc2\xa0 Why totally rely on them instead of going out to some other private sector organizations to possibly get some help?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going in a circle here, April.\xc2\xa0 But I got to say -- hold on one second, let me just finish this.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe that there is an entity in this country or, quite frankly, outside of this country that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been looked at or tapped into in order to try to make progress on this.\xc2\xa0 It just -- there is nobody that believes that what is going on, continuing to happen, is in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, everybody is trying to seek a solution.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the Woods Hole Center that found the Titanic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, April, I\xe2\x80\x99m way out of my proverbial depth.\xc2\xa0 Locating a ship resting on the floor of the ocean for many decades is somewhat different than finding a submersible to get to that depth and plugging many leaks in a riser pipe and in a blowout preventer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If it was just about pictures, if it was just about taking pictures, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 This is -- I hate to -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not simplifying it because I\xe2\x80\x99m not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly in follow up, I asked you something a couple of times on the issue --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on the cost -- the cost of jobs.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been working with people about the jobs that are lost down there, the fisheries that are affected?\xc2\xa0 Also on the cost of gasoline, as well as on the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is -- as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, this was not production oil.\xc2\xa0 This was exploratory drilling.\xc2\xa0 So the oil lost is not lost in a marketplace that expected a certain amount of deliverable oil on a schedule.\xc2\xa0 So, look, I think gas prices go up normally at this time of year as there\xe2\x80\x99s blend switching and increased demand for driving.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So in terms of jobs, SBA has been on the ground for now at least a couple of weeks, as NOAA first closed a portion of the Gulf and has now expanded the closing of the portion of the Gulf to commercial fishermen.\xc2\xa0 And that I think expands throughout the Gulf in order to deal with legitimate claims for economic loss or damage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Glenn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still support Blanche Lincoln in her runoff against Halter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to do anything in terms of fundraising or cutting ads?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked to do anything by the campaign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the lesson of -- a lot of people have speculated on the lessons of the Specter loss.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a signal to the President that he might in the future want to support a candidate who more closely represents the base of the party like Sestak, rather than a candidate -- an alliance with --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Glenn, we -- Senator Specter was -- Senator Specter made a series of important and courageous votes on economic recovery and on health care that the President was enormously thankful for.\xc2\xa0 He was, because of his switch, a member of -- an incumbent senator and a member of the Democratic Party and he enjoyed our support.\xc2\xa0 The President traveled there and raised money for him.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden traveled there a number of times as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he spoken to Specter?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He has.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could you just sort of --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it was -- he left him a message I believe on election night.\xc2\xa0 I think they connected today.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get a readout of that.\xc2\xa0 I think it happened not long before I came out here.</p>\n<p>But, again, Glenn, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going out -- way out on a limb to say this is a -- this is an anti-incumbent year, and Senator Specter had spent 29 years in one party and switched parties and was running in the Democratic Party in an extremely tough year for any incumbent.</p>\n<p>I will say this, as I said earlier, I think the -- what happened with -- what has happened with the Republican Party, and is the evidence you see in somebody like Arlen Specter, they are not even welcome in the party in which they\xe2\x80\x99ve been serving for 29 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I missed you over here.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you please elaborate a little bit on what John Brennan said about Hezbollah of Lebanon, that the administration is trying to -- some moderate elements within the party that was --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- let me get something from John on that.\xc2\xa0 And not -- George, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s your birthday, so let me -- (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I have 12 questions.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who do you think you are, Peter Baker?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joking.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, can I just point out for the record that since Peter asked his 12 questions, he and Mike have been playing with that iPod virtually continuously since that point.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I hate to bust them like that -- yes, the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking up --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re organizing a system for you to get back to us.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to Google that when I get back.</p>\n<p>Go ahead, George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mexican officials are privately very frustrated that no matter how many times they bring up the trucking issue with President Obama, they don\xe2\x80\x99t see any movement toward the United States honoring its treaty obligations there.\xc2\xa0 Is that frustration understandable?\xc2\xa0 And was any progress made --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get NEC -- I will get NEC to get something on that.\xc2\xa0 I know obviously that it came up as part of the two delegations in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s been something that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed around here, so let me get some greater clarity on that.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with Mike, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President made very clear yesterday that he supports President Calder\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in the war against narcotraffickers.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to Afghanistan, he\xe2\x80\x99s talked a lot about revaluating things as time goes on, looking at metrics, relooking at strategies.\xc2\xa0 The metrics in Mexico are not very good, and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been very good for a while.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of set in stone, or is there an active process at all, looking at whether their strategy --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our support or whether --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whether we support their strategy or whether there\xe2\x80\x99s possibly a better strategy or another strategy to deal with these issues?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I do not believe -- and, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll check with our Mexico guys whether or not a discussion of changing that strategy was part of these discussions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as you heard the President say, what President Calder\xc3\xb3n has done has been courageous and at the risk of safety and his own political standing has not been easy to undertake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me talk to them and see if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that came up throughout those discussions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, quick thing on the Rand Paul -- does the White House have any comment or any position on his position on the civil rights act?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not -- I saw clips of the interview; I\xe2\x80\x99ve not watched the whole thing.\xc2\xa0 I think I would go back to the answer I gave a little bit ago in terms of the narrowness of or the expansiveness of which -- of the party.\xc2\xa0 I think the issues that many fought for in the \xe2\x80\x9850s and the \xe2\x80\x9860s were settled a long time ago in landmark legislation.\xc2\xa0 And a discussion about whether or not you support those I don\xe2\x80\x99t think has a real -- shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a place in our political dialogue in 2010.</p>\n<p>Thanks.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:54 P.M.
