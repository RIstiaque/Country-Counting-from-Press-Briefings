EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Happy Halloween.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here for our off-camera gaggle previewing the President\'s trip later this week to the G20.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today someone you all know, Ben Rhodes, the Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications.\xc2\xa0 I also have on my left the Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs Lael Brainard; and on my right the Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economic Affairs Mike Froman.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have them here to discuss, as I said, the President\'s upcoming trip, take your questions on that trip.\xc2\xa0 I will remain after they leave to take your questions on other issues if you have any. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, Ben, I\'ll turn it over to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Trick or treat there.\xc2\xa0 Feel free to take two pieces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we want to talk a little bit about the President\'s trip to the G20 today.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just start by giving a bit of an overview of the schedule as it currently stands, and then turn it over to these guys to dig deeper into the issues that will be discussed in Cannes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ll be leaving here Wednesday night to fly to France.\xc2\xa0 After we arrive, we\'ll have two bilateral meetings in the morning, first with President Sarkozy of France, and then with Chancellor Merkel of Germany.\xc2\xa0 These are obviously the two largest economies in the eurozone and two leaders that the President has been in very close contact with over the last weeks and months about the issues that will be discussed at the G20 and about the situation in the eurozone.\xc2\xa0 So these will be important meetings for him to have consultations with these leaders before the G20 commences.\xc2\xa0 And Mike and Lael can speak a little bit more about those issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following those meetings he will also have a meeting with the L20, the international labor leaders who will be in Cannes as a part of the G20 program.\xc2\xa0 And then that afternoon we head directly into the G20 schedule.\xc2\xa0 And the G20 schedule for that afternoon includes a working lunch and then a number of sessions and a working dinner.\xc2\xa0 So the rest of the day on Thursday will be taken up with the G20 schedule.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then Friday morning, we will complete the G20 with a number of sessions in the morning and early afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Following the conclusion of the G20, the President will be able to meet with President Kirchner of Argentina.\xc2\xa0 She was recently reelected, as you may know, and this is an important opportunity for the U.S. and Argentina to discuss our relationship going forward and to congratulate her on her reelection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following that meeting, the President will have a press conference, as he usually does at the end of the G20.\xc2\xa0 And then we may have additional opportunities to spend some time with President Sarkozy.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working that out as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there are additional meetings that emerge on the margins of the G20, we\'ll, of course, let you know about them either before or during the sessions.\xc2\xa0 The President often has opportunities to speak to his counterparts at these summits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\'ll turn it over to Mike to talk through some of the issues, and then we\'ll go to Lael, and then we\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, as you all know, this is the -- Cannes will be the fifth G20 that President Obama attends.\xc2\xa0 In Pittsburgh, the leaders agreed to make the G20 the premiere forum for global economic cooperation and it\'s already established a solid track record of action. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In London, as you may recall, the G20 countries deployed their combined fire power to deal with the crisis of 2008-2009.\xc2\xa0 In Pittsburgh, the G20 launched the framework for strong, balanced and sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 In Toronto and Seoul, the G20 elaborated on that framework and launched work programs into new areas like anticorruption and development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The G20 agenda is critical to growing our economy here back at home, to strengthening the recovery, to increase exports and to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his op-ed last week, the U.S. plays a leadership role in strengthening the global recovery.\xc2\xa0 To promote near-term growth and job creation, the President of course has proposed the American Jobs Act, but he\'s also proposed the framework to put our medium-term public finances in stronger, more sustainable footing as well.\xc2\xa0 And together we think this approach of spurring job creation and growth in the near term and meaningful deficit reduction in the medium term represents the best insurance policy to protect the U.S. economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Cannes, we expect the eurozone to be the primary focus of discussion, but in addition, the leaders will focus on mechanisms that have been put in place to ensure strong, balanced and sustainable growth.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll talk about the next stages of financial regulatory reform, and they\'ll talk about how to keep momentum going on G20 priorities on common global challenges -- everything from development for security and infrastructure, as well as the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, fighting corruption, and strengthening the multilateral trading system consistent with our interest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These summits, like any summits, really have three purposes:\xc2\xa0 One, they\'re action-forcing events to make decisions; they are ongoing processes for getting work done below the leader level; and they\xe2\x80\x99re an opportunity for leaders to engage directly with their counterparts on the issues of the day. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me say, in many respects, the Cannes G20 has already been an important success as being a catalyst for the decisions that Europe took last week to deal with its crisis.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\'s more discussion to be had among leaders about the next steps in that process to include the fleshing out of the details and their full implementation.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the context in which the President goes to Cannes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And let me turn it over to Under Secretary Brainard.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Against a backdrop of renewed global risks, there is growing agreement around the world that the focus at Cannes needs to be on growth, safeguarding the fragile recovery, and laying the foundation for stronger, more balanced growth will, therefore, be the core of our economic agenda in Cannes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama remains intensely focused on putting Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0 Recovery in the U.S. remains fragile and still too vulnerable to disruption beyond our shores.\xc2\xa0 Pro-growth policies in the near term and meaningful deficit reduction in the medium term provide the best insurance policy to protect the U.S. recovery from global risks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama goes into Cannes on the heels of signing three new trade agreements that are at the center of our growth agenda by securing new markets for U.S. goods and services exports.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue in the weeks ahead seeking opportunities to capitalize on the export-led engine of growth and job creation that\xe2\x80\x99s central to the recovery, advancing the President\xe2\x80\x99s national export initiative goal of doubling exports in five years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama will also continue his close engagement with European leaders in Cannes, working together to safeguard the global recovery.\xc2\xa0 The comprehensive plan agreed by European leaders last week will lay a critical foundation for a durable solution to the euro area crisis.\xc2\xa0 The plan contains all the right elements:\xc2\xa0 building a more powerful firewall to overwhelm the markets and protect sovereigns so they have access to affordable financing as they reform; ensuring European banks have the liquidity and the capital cushions they need to maintain the full confidence of depositors and creditors; charting a sustainable path forward for Greece to support crucial fiscal and structural reforms; and ensuring member states are pursuing sound economic policies to address the root causes of today\xe2\x80\x99s crisis.\xc2\xa0 We are looking forward to hearing more at Cannes about the further elaboration and implementation of these elements. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the challenges facing Europe have significant implications for the U.S. economy and for the global economy.\xc2\xa0 The EU is a critical anchor of global stability, and our single-largest trading partner.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, Europe has the resources and the capacity to overcome these risks.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to support our European allies in their efforts to address this crisis, alongside the IMF and our G20 partners.\xc2\xa0 We also welcome Japan\xe2\x80\x99s recent initiatives to support growth by accelerating expenditures in its third supplemental budget, and through implementation of its national growth strategy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With weak demand in advanced economies, emerging markets, especially those with large surpluses, have substantial capacity to support growth by pivoting more rapidly to a pro-growth strategy driven by domestic consumption.\xc2\xa0 Recall in Pittsburgh, the leaders of the G20 recognized that an unbalanced global recovery will be neither strong nor durable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In China and other surplus emerging-market economies, allowing exchange rates to appreciate to reflect market forces is the most powerful near-term tool to accelerate the shift to domestic consumption, while countering inflationary pressures.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, the G20 will press forward with financial reform.\xc2\xa0 In Cannes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll seek agreement on a new global margin standard on uncleared derivatives trades to create incentives for central clearing while pushing forward on standardization of derivatives, exchange trading and trade reporting.\xc2\xa0 These efforts are critical to ensure international coherence and greater oversight of capital markets.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also expect the G20 leaders to move forward on important reforms for the largest, most interconnected financial institutions, including adopting a new standard for resolution regimes so that large cross-border firms can be resolved without severe disruption or taxpayer exposure to loss.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll also ask these firms to hold higher capital buffers so that they can withstand future shocks without imposing costs on the economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This builds on a host of initiatives to ensure the largest financial institutions bear their fair share of the burden and are discouraged from the risky behavior that led to the crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Stronger and more balanced growth, financial stability, these will be the key touchstones for the G20.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 If we can take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I had two questions for Lael, please.\xc2\xa0 The firewall that you mentioned, how confident is the United States that the European countries will be able to achieve that? It\xe2\x80\x99s expected to be $1.4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And will the United States either directly or indirectly be contributing any money to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Let me just say that the announcements that European leaders made last week were very significant.\xc2\xa0 We are going to hear more about the details of how they move forward on the four elements, including on the firewall.\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to hearing more about the elaboration and implementation of those initiatives at Cannes.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we are, along with other members of the G20, going to stand with Europe and support Europe.\xc2\xa0 Europe has substantial resources that it can bring to bear to address the challenge and we have a lot of confidence that they will do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you say you stand with them and support them, will there be any U.S. financial commitment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 The U.S., as you know, went through a number of important decisions on its own during our financial crisis, and we have been very engaged with Europeans, sharing our experiences during the crisis where we, ourselves, took quite decisive and overwhelming action to address the financial disruptions to our own economy.\xc2\xa0 And so we\'ll continue talking with Europe about those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The IMF also has played an important role, and through it the United States will continue to support Europe.\xc2\xa0 The IMF, as you know, received substantially greater resources, at our behest and with our support, back in 2009, and those resources are largely available today to support Europe and other countries as they confront financial volatility and as they mount plan to restore stability in the euro area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if I could follow up.\xc2\xa0 Do the Europeans really have the luxury of spending weeks, if not months, to flesh out the details of this plan, is my first question.\xc2\xa0 And I\'d like to follow up on something else as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as Mike noted earlier, European leaders came together.\xc2\xa0 They used the G20 summit in Cannes as a action-forcing event.\xc2\xa0 They came together on a comprehensive plan with the four key elements to address their crisis, and they will continue, I believe, moving quickly to elaborate and implement the four elements.\xc2\xa0 And we expect to hear more about those details and the implementation at Cannes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And to follow up, the Bank of Japan was intervening in currency markets overnight.\xc2\xa0 You talked about the need for currencies to appreciate for emerging economies that have surpluses.\xc2\xa0 But are you concerned over Japan intervening to prevent the rise of the yen?\xc2\xa0 That sends a potentially conflicting signal to that desire to see currency fluctuate freely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So the G7 reaffirmed in September its commitment to market-determined exchange rates.\xc2\xa0 In the absence of disorderly conditions or excessive volatility, that remains our position.\xc2\xa0 And in the G20 discussions, we do expect that as we look at the rebalancing agenda, emerging market economies that have surpluses will continue to move forward on their commitments to rebalance demand by allowing their exchange rates to appreciate in line with market forces, which is the most powerful tool they have to encourage the pivot to domestic consumption-led growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dr. Brainard, what -- or, Mr. Froman, what message will the U.S. deliver to Europe about their interest in China helping to make up some of the bailout fund?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So let me just broaden out that question a little bit.\xc2\xa0 You\'ll remember that, in Pittsburgh, it was President Obama that led the initiative to make the G20 the premiere forum for international cooperation to strengthen growth and to secure more balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 And that was because he saw then the importance that these economies, the emerging markets, would play in coming years in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 So it is, I think, important that we have all the countries around the table, including key emerging markets.\xc2\xa0 And China and other emerging markets -- like us -- have a tremendous interest in seeing European stability and confidence return, and European growth return.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of us are going to work together to support European efforts.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very much in all of our interests to see them return to stability and growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has made it clear that we want -- or this administration wants Europe to bail out Europe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say again, we are all working with Europe.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very much in all of our interests.\xc2\xa0 But Europe has substantial capacity, substantial resources, and, indeed, they\'ve indicated that they are going to bring those resources to bear.\xc2\xa0 So we will stand with other members of the G20.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll continue to support the IMF having a very important role working with Europe as Europe takes steps to address its own crisis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying it\'s okay with the U.S. if China contributes a significant sum to that bailout fund?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 I think that we will have a variety of conversations in Cannes about steering the global economy to a stronger place, and we\'ll have members of the G20 sitting around the table that make contributions such as -- in the case, for instance, of some of the emerging market surplus economies, they have a tremendous contribution they can make through their own domestic consumption and through pivoting to domestic consumption-like growth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll all stand together with the IMF, but again, Europe has substantial resources to bring to bear to the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the IMF is much better resourced than it was in 2009 because of our efforts in 2009.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2009, compared to today, I think the IMF has four times greater resources to deal with any crisis around the world than we saw back in 2009.\xc2\xa0 But we will have a set of conversations, and we will work together with other countries to support Europe and to support the global recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is for Ben.\xc2\xa0 You were talking about this meeting with President Kirchner.\xc2\xa0 So the relationship between the two countries has not been particularly good in the past months, so I would like to know what you are expecting there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you expect, for example, any engagement from Argentina concerning the point that has been the burden in the relationship in the past months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly there have been ups and downs in the U.S.-Argentina relationship over the last couple of years. But we believe very much that when you have an election and you have a new mandate for a leader, that presents an opportunity to put the relationship on a stronger footing and to establish a basis for cooperation going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we very much view this as an opportunity following the reelection of President Kirchner to pivot on the relationship towards a more positive direction, and again, to cooperate with Argentina on issues in the hemisphere, our shared interest in economic growth and security in the Americas, as well as cooperating on global issues, Argentina, obviously, being a member of the G20 and many other forums where we have common interests. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take advantage of this opportunity for the two leaders to come together after President Kirchner has won her new mandate and to, again, put the relationship on a stronger foundation and point a positive way forward coming out of the meeting between the two Presidents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talked about the shared experience you have with the Europeans.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you have been listened to enough?\xc2\xa0 And I would like also to know (inaudible) came out in support of the new transaction tax, the international financial transaction tax.\xc2\xa0 Would you support that (inaudible)?\xc2\xa0 And is that why you say that you need to see President Sarkozy again at the end of the G20, so is there a specific reason for that?\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the last question first.\xc2\xa0 Simply the fact that we are in France and President Sarkozy is the host, the President was interested in spending additional time with France as a key ally of the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the principal reason why. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have the bilateral meeting at the beginning that will be intensely focused on the G20 agenda.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated, but the thought was that the two Presidents, given their close personal relationship and the close alliance between the U.S. and France, would have some additional time together at the end of the summit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had very extensive engagement with Europe and, of course, we worked closely with them during our financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 I think President Obama has had a number of important conversations with his European counterparts, and we have shared back and forth some of the experiences we had during the crisis, and in particular, the need to move with overwhelming force.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to discussions about getting the financial sector to bear their fair share of the burden, we\xe2\x80\x99re very much in sync with Europe on their goal of ensuring both that the financial sector -- large financial institutions -- bear their fair share of the burden, but also that they\'re discouraged from taking the kind of risky behavior that led to the crisis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a number of steps and got started a little earlier here, as you know.\xc2\xa0 We undertook stress tests back in 2009 and asked our largest financial institutions to materially increase their capital buffers, and they have.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve doubled their capital since that time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has also put forward a financial crisis responsibility fee that would be directed at the largest financial institutions that really impose the greatest costs on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well designed to both deter the kind of risky behavior that led to the crisis, and to ensure that these large financial institutions and not retail investors bear their fair share of the burden.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I would just add to it that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to hearing the full Bill Gates report, but our understanding is in fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s looked at development finance, broadly, including the importance of developing countries mobilizing domestic sources of finance and creating enabling environments for attracting private sector investment; countries upholding their commitments to aid where there is a varying degree of success; and then a series of innovative financing techniques -- that being just one of several that he is suggesting are worth consideration.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to having that conversation about the array of things that could be done to support development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just partially answered the question I had.\xc2\xa0 I understand that the development portion of the agenda is going to come up on the first day.\xc2\xa0 What are President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s goals for the issues of hunger, food security, the other humanitarian issues?\xc2\xa0 And what are the prospects of that just simply going to get overwhelmed by the overriding issue of the debt crisis?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you may recall, in L\xe2\x80\x99Aquila three years ago, the President launched a food security initiative -- here in the United States it\xe2\x80\x99s called Feed the Future -- and it mobilized over $20 billion of commitments from around the world. But more importantly -- or equally importantly to the overall commitment, was the agreement to have countries align their assistance programs with country plans to focus on increasing agricultural productivity and leveraging the private sector that had as much to do with changing the way we do development assistance, consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s own development policies that he laid out about a year or so ago at the U.N. as it does with the mobilization of finance itself.\xc2\xa0 So that will be very much on the agenda. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Koreans added development to the G20 agenda last year.\xc2\xa0 The French focused on food security and infrastructure in developing countries as the two priorities for this year.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to engaging with that, because he has been personally very much involved in both of those issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 My question is to Ben.\xc2\xa0 Ben, the Russians keep raising the possibility of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Moscow in December.\xc2\xa0 Is such a possibility even considered at the White House?\xc2\xa0 And if not, what are your plans for the upcoming bilaterals?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 At this point, we don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate the President being able to travel to Russia this year, given a very aggressive schedule both domestically and then internationally. However, he will be, in addition to the G20, as you know, going to the -- hosting the APEC forum in Hawaii and then going to the EAS.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly anticipate that we will have the opportunity to have the bilateral meeting with President Medvedev at one of those stops on the Asia Pacific trip.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly believe he\'ll meet with President Medvedev bilaterally.\xc2\xa0 We think it\'s unlikely that he\'ll be able to get to Russia this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there specific things the President is seeking at the G20 and in the bilaterals that you can talk about, and more generally, how you would judge the success of this trip at the end of it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d say a couple of things, and would just offer Lael or Mike the opportunity to add to this. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Mike said, the G20 is both an ongoing process and an action-forcing mechanism.\xc2\xa0 The preeminent issue right now in the global economy has been the eurozone crisis.\xc2\xa0 The steps that the Europeans took in announcing a comprehensive package in advance of the G20 was an important marker leading into the G20 to give confidence and to provide a way forward that could help stabilize the situation in Europe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Lael has said, there will be discussions about the ongoing implementation of that plan.\xc2\xa0 And I think what we want to see is a G20 as a forum where the leaders of the world\'s largest economies can come together behind that plan and in support of it, to project, again, confidence in the efforts to address the situation in the eurozone and to move forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we also see the G20 as an important place to focus on steps that countries are taking to foster both growth in the immediate term that can stabilize the global economy, and then the type of fiscal consolidation in the medium and long term that the United States is pursuing at home as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, lastly, it\'s, of course, an important forum to discuss a range of issues across the international agenda, be it development, be it the continued efforts to reform and modernize organizations like the G20 and others that address these global issues.\xc2\xa0 But I think, as we\'ve led into it, the President\'s conversations with his counterparts, particularly his European counterparts, have really focused on this question of, how do we deal with the eurozone crisis; what lessons do we have to offer from our own financial crisis, in which the U.S. took very robust action, again, to address a financial crisis in our country and also to help stabilize the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And so those discussions will be ongoing as he talks to Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy, and then with his other leaders there. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s how I would frame it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roger.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to go back to the transaction tax.\xc2\xa0 Europe is going to be pushing it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not clear on what the U.S. position is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think Europe is in the middle of their own discussions within not just the euro area but within the EU more broadly.\xc2\xa0 We\'re very much synched up with the goal of assuring that the largest financial institutions, whose risky behavior led to our financial crisis, bear the burden of the costs associated with it, and also have disincentives to engage in that kind of behavior.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve put in place a number of elements that we think are very powerful in that direction, including, as I mentioned earlier, asking them to hold much thicker capital cushions.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have agreement, we think, at the G20 on additional capital buffers for the largest financial institutions.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve also put forward a financial responsibility fee.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As Europe is thinking through how to go forward on its own goals, they\'ll be going through the same thought process that we went through.\xc2\xa0 And we put forward the fee because we think it\'s more important to put the burden on the largest financial institutions rather than shifting it to retail investors.\xc2\xa0 We think that the financial responsibility fee, which is on the liabilities of the largest financial institutions, is well targeted to make those institutions that are bearing greater risk pay more.\xc2\xa0 It is better targeted to prevent evasion.\xc2\xa0 And the IMF went through a similar assessment exercise and came, frankly, to a pretty similar conclusion.\xc2\xa0 But that said, looking forward to having the discussions with them; share very much the goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the U.S. will not support it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Again, we very much support the goal and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that the goal is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 -- look forward to having conversations about the best way to achieve that goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, then Jon-Christopher.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about whether you\'re concerned at all that China is being asked for 100 billion euros to bail out Europe?\xc2\xa0 And will this G20 -- will the headline coming out of it be that this is a shift in economic power to Asia and Latin America?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I would repeat something that Lael said earlier, which is that the whole idea of the G20 and the reason that President Obama insisted on it becoming the premiere forum for international cooperation is to recognize that emerging economies have an important role to play, commensurate with their size in the global economy; that they need to have a seat at the table, and that there are certain responsibilities that go along with having that seat at the table. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the concept that China and other emerging economies are part of this discussion, that they will be there, along with ourselves and other industrialized countries, speaking with the Europeans, talking about the elaboration and the implementation of their plan, and expressing unity and support of what the Europeans are doing, we think is very much appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. is the largest economy in the world.\xc2\xa0 We are a very important market to China and others.\xc2\xa0 We continue -- this is the place that parents all over the world want to send their kids to university.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re the center of innovation.\xc2\xa0 We have a great network of alliances around the world that no other country has. People continue -- I\xe2\x80\x99m struck -- in the G20 and the other forums that we\'re involved in, I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by the degree to which other countries very much look to the U.S. for leadership, thought leadership and leadership on action, to ensure a way to resolve global problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that China is being asked for a hundred billion euros, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to bail out Europe -- might bail out Europe?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 As I said, I think the U.S. plays a critical leadership role, and we believe that having all the major emerging and developing countries around the table, along with the industrialized countries, talking about what\xe2\x80\x99s important for the global economy is what the G20 is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of the recent vote in Parliament last week regarding the level of involvement Great Britain will be having in the EU, will the President be speaking to Prime Minister Cameron?\xc2\xa0 Will it be a bilateral?\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of this particular issue that\xe2\x80\x99s going on -- conflict that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the UK right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 The President is very much aware of it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will have an opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Cameron over the course of their time together there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no bilateral set up at the moment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no formal bilateral set up at the moment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If we can just take a couple more for Lael and Mike. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a push in Europe to regulate credit rating agencies and essentially shield countries -- there are going through bailouts from adverse credit ratings.\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be part of the regulatory reform discussion at the G20?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what\xe2\x80\x99s the U.S. position on it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 The G20 and the FSB have, to date, been very focused on credit rating agencies, but making sure that credit ratings don\xe2\x80\x99t play an inappropriate role in terms of the supervisory process.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a number of very strong commitments there to ensure that credit ratings are not used in a mechanical way but that supervisors are actively engaged. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I would anticipate that conversations will continue along those lines.\xc2\xa0 As you know, in the U.S., under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Dodd-Frank Act has very strong provisions so that supervisors need to assess risk weights without relying, as they had previously, on credit ratings.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a number of very strong steps here to ensure that credit ratings play a more appropriate role.\xc2\xa0 And so that is, to date, where the G20 and FSB discussions have been, and I anticipate they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue in that vein.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two important follow-ups.\xc2\xa0 First, my colleague from Bloomberg asked a pretty important question -- because the people on Wall Street do not know how to parse diplomatic-speak.\xc2\xa0 And so you will probably roil the markets if your wording is not clear and concise.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So could you please tell us if the U.S. supports or opposes a transaction tax, number one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Number two, to Norah\xe2\x80\x99s question, Europe\'s relation with China has been reduced to mendicancy.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re mendicants to China.\xc2\xa0 You talk about talking about currency manipulation and China\xe2\x80\x99s mercantilism.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like an empty agenda item if Europe is going to China hat in hand.\xc2\xa0 What kind of strong language can they expect out of the G20?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So on the issue of how to get Wall Street to bear its fair share of the burden, how to ensure that the largest financial institutions do not again impose costs on the system through risky behavior, were very much in sync with Europe.\xc2\xa0 Europe is having its own conversations about this issue. They are looking at a financial transactions tax, but there is a debate within the European Union, as you know, on this issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very much aligned on the goal.\xc2\xa0 We went through our own analysis and assessment.\xc2\xa0 We put in place a number of things that we think are very tough and very effective, including having our institutions go through stress tests and requiring them to build capital, to double capital.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now going to require the largest institutions to build additional capital buffers.\xc2\xa0 We put forward a fee -- a financial crisis responsibility fee that, again, we think is well targeted because it puts the burden on the largest institutions, yet disincents them from taking risky behavior that could be imposing costs on the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we think that\'s an approach that works better than putting the burden on retail investors.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s an approach that better addresses issues of evasion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have that conversation with European friends and more broadly. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of what role we would want to see various emerging markets playing, I think it is, again, very much with our support and leadership that the major emerging economies are sitting at the G20, which is now the premiere forum for steering the global economy.\xc2\xa0 They have critically important contributions to make in steering the global recovery. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they have said in the G20, and we expect them to continue moving in their policies to contribute importantly by shifting to more domestic, consumption-led growth.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 They\'re looking at the same numbers that we are.\xc2\xa0 Demand is likely to be weak in the advanced economies for some time, so it\xe2\x80\x99s very much in China\xe2\x80\x99s own interest, as they know, and as you see in their own policies, to shift to domestic consumption-led growth, rather than relying on an outdated growth model based on net exports to advanced economies where demand is likely to be weak for some time.\xc2\xa0 And the exchange rate plays the most powerful potential near-term role as a lever in helping that shift.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They will also be -- parts of the conversation in how we make sure that the IMF continues to be as strong as it possibly can be.\xc2\xa0 And again, it has four times greater resources than it had going into the crisis in 2008-2009, when we moved forward on this very significant decision to up the resources. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to having that conversation, and we think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the emerging markets be central parts of that conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I want to thank Mike and Lael, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to other topics, if that\'s okay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tony Blair meeting, can you give us a --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As we said when we announced it, there\xe2\x80\x99s no set agenda.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously talk -- discuss a number of topics.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more specific on it for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the President aware that Qaddafi had kept his chemical weapons?\xc2\xa0 Or were reports of chemical weapons being found in Libya a surprise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anything that\'s been reported that has surprised us out of Libya, but I can check on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Palestine is now a member of UNESCO.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s our thinking about this?\xc2\xa0 How does that affect Israel\'s relationship with the Palestinians --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s vote at UNESCO to admit the Palestinian Authority as a member is premature and undermines the international community\xe2\x80\x99s shared goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s vote distracts us from our shared goal of direct negotiations that result in a secure Israel and an independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security.\xc2\xa0 I mean, not unlike the issues of membership, as we discussed, the path to peace is through direct negotiations, and we support measures that -- and steps that bring the two sides closer to direct negotiations, which is the only way to resolve the differences between them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 Yes, Victoria.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the reason for putting both David Plouffe and David Axelrod on the Sunday shows yesterday?\xc2\xa0 I mean, generally speaking, if you\'re going to have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To see who did better.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, usually you put one political strategist out there, but to put two out -- I mean, it was like two guns.\xc2\xa0 It was just odd this early in the campaign to put two out there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We make decisions about who appears on which show based on not just our desires, but on the requests.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, David Plouffe\'s role here in the White House is different from a role on the campaign, and he can address different subjects more broadly, and certainly did in his appearance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you\'re announcing some new steps today on the We Can\'t Wait program regarding prescription drug shortages.\xc2\xa0 Given that there\'s pending legislation in Congress and, if I understand, only today is the White House actually endorsing that, why is it necessary to move forward unilaterally from this end if you\'re just now endorsing what Congress is doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, our endorsement hasn\'t determined whether or not Congress acts on a piece of legislation, first of all.\xc2\xa0 As we have said throughout this initiative and in general, the President looks to ways he can use his executive authority to, broadly speaking, help Americans who can be helped through actions that this administration can take -- whether it\'s helping underwater homeowners refinance their loans, take advantage of these historically low mortgage rates, or students ease the burden of their student loans, or, in this case, speed access -- or ensure that there are not shortages of -- try to ensure that there are not shortages of very, very important drugs for Americans who may be in great need of them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we will continue to take these actions as the President determines them, because we can\'t wait for Congress to act -- whether it\'s on legislation to take on this problem or on the American Jobs Act, the provisions therein that the Congress, thus far, has refused to pass -- the Republicans in Congress have refused to pass in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 We hope that changes as more votes are taken in the Senate, because there is no more urgent priority than the need to grow the economy and create jobs here in America.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Scott.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is the White House going to keep that focus on the economy during this short G20 trip within the longer --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, both of these trips are all about economic growth, global as well as domestic economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The President has said repeatedly, as have I and others, that the crisis in the eurozone has a direct effect on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 It is why it\'s so important that Europeans implement the important decisions that they made last week, and why the G20, as a forcing mechanism, was so important and continues to be so important.\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously a leader in that forum.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That will be the case when he goes to the Asia Pacific region and participates in both APEC and the EAS and other -- has other meetings that are directly related to the need to expand global markets to grow the economy in that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And that has great benefit to American markets and to American workers.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would also simply say that we will continue to press the agenda on all fronts while the President travels, both from wherever he is and here back in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mark.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the announcement -- I\'m sorry -- are the Republicans obstructing this in some fashion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the question here isn\'t -- it\'s not about a contrast, necessarily.\xc2\xa0 It\'s simply about action.\xc2\xa0 Action needs to be taken; action hasn\'t been taken on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 So the President has the authority to take this action, so he will take it because it\'s in the best interests of the American people and the many Americans who need these particular drugs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s no counterpoint -- it\'s not as if you\'re -- this is one or the other; it\'s not like the jobs package where there\'s specific votes that have been against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but there is inaction.\xc2\xa0 There is a lack of action, so there is a need to move -- because we can move.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is not, broadly speaking -- the We Can\'t Wait actions, the executive actions that the President is taking and will take are not substitutes for legislative action.\xc2\xa0 He fully understands that the kinds of things that are contained within the American Jobs Act require congressional action, require laws being passed.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he\'s pressing for Congress to take action legislatively.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he can also act independently -- or, rather, administratively, and exercise his executive authority to benefit the American people in other ways.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 The President is now going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to APEC and East Asian Summit as well.\xc2\xa0 Will he hold any bilateral meetings with President Hu?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more meetings to announce beyond what Ben did at the top of this briefing.\xc2\xa0 As we have meetings to announce we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly make you aware of them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you arranging --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you arranging the meeting right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that would be kind of announcing it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Or announcing our intentions.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait for the announcement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the House Speaker has expressed concerns over some of the We Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait legislation or executive action, and the RNC is suggesting its political expediency.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you addressed this, but could you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked about this concern, which I would just suggest is misplaced, because the President is acting well within his authority, well within his constitutional authority.\xc2\xa0 And he is simply acting to help the American people, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s with their mortgages, their student loans, their access to vital drugs, assisting businesses to speed up the process by which they get either contracts with or payments from the federal government.\xc2\xa0 These are all measures he can take administratively, and he will continue to take them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, one of the reasons why we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait is because Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act.\xc2\xa0 So if the Speaker is concerned about the President acting administratively, he can certainly assist in the effort by allowing the provisions of the American Jobs Act, for example, to be voted on by the House of Representatives.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Paula.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Keystone Excel Project -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been deferring that decision to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of reputable scientists and climatologists that have said that this would cause irreversible environmental damage if that pipeline is built, so -- and also, it\xe2\x80\x99s a litmus test for the President as far as his commitment to climate change.\xc2\xa0 So what is the White House response to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say two things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to addressing these issues has been demonstrated by the actions he took for historic fuel efficiency standards, an action which by itself will have dramatic effect on the amount of fuel consumed in this country.\xc2\xa0 Great reduction -- great increase in our fuel efficiency; great reduction in our demand for foreign fuel from -- I mean, fuel from abroad, as well as savings for American consumers that are quite extensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I will return to the fact that this is a decision that will be made by the State Department, or is housed within the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And they are taking into -- they are in a phase now of taking into public account, public comment and comments certainly from experts, both environmental as well as energy experts.\xc2\xa0 So this process includes a full review of various concerns from all areas.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jay, let\xe2\x80\x99s just do one more.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One more. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one more question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes. Sorry.\xc2\xa0 And then you -- yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I know one of the arguments for supporters is that it would create jobs as well as that there is a concern about the need for reducing foreign dependence on oil.\xc2\xa0 But those that oppose it are saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s no guarantee that the oil would even go -- or stay within the United States, that it could be exported to other countries such as China.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I understand.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get me to engage in something that\xe2\x80\x99s being reviewed over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And my comments weren\xe2\x80\x99t meant to address the Keystone issue, but to -- in response to the suggestion -- or the comment you made about the President\xe2\x80\x99s environmental record. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, I would point to you that just one of his achievements, the fuel economy standards accomplished by this administration, with industry support and without the need of congressional action -- which, given our circumstance is always a good thing -- will reduce our reliance on foreign oil, saving a total of 12 billion barrels of oil, and by 2025, reduce oil consumption by 2.2 million barrels a day -- as much as half of the oil we import from OPEC every day.\xc2\xa0 These steps will save American families $1.7 trillion, and by 2025, result in an average fuel savings of over $8,000 per vehicle.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, Mr. Plouffe on \xe2\x80\x9cMeet the Press\xe2\x80\x9d had strong words about Mr. Romney.\xc2\xa0 Would you say those are Mr. Plouffe\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, or does that represent the White House\xe2\x80\x99s opinion?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, Mr. Plouffe works for the White House, so I would say that his views represent the White House\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 You have to be more specific if there is a -- that is my broad statement, but is there one in particular that you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That he has no core?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think as anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s watched this campaign and watched Mr. Romney\xe2\x80\x99s previous campaigns, it is always a question as to where he was and where he is and where he might be on any given issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND 11:29 A.M.
