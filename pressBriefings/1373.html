BURTON:\xc2\xa0 All right, so, a couple things here before start.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Bill, can you try to speak louder?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You bet.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow the President will host a meeting of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Economic Recovery Advisory Board -- also known as PERAB -- at the White House to discuss a range of economic issues, including job creation and the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to double the number of exports over the next five years.\xc2\xa0 He will discuss with PERAB members the urgent need to pass strong financial reform legislation and the momentum behind reform efforts currently in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 He will specifically address the steps we must take to strengthen oversight of derivatives, the same financial products that led to the near collapse of AIG, warning that the problems of the future will rest on the steps we take to address derivatives now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s on that board, Bill, do you know?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can get you a full list of it.\xc2\xa0 It includes --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So who\xe2\x80\x99s going to be at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Wolf will be there, Robert Wolf.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll get you a full list.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for digging me on a question I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, some notes on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got going today.\xc2\xa0 On the plane is Senator Bill Nelson, Representative Kosmas, Buzz Aldrin, John Holdren, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden.\xc2\xa0 Mona is along for the ride.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Mona Sutphen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s the person you said before Bolden?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Before Bolden?\xc2\xa0 Buzz Aldrin.\xc2\xa0 Astronaut.\xc2\xa0 American hero.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Before the speech, the President will tour a commercial rocket facility, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll see a Falcon 9 rocket, which is scheduled to lift off next month.\xc2\xa0 Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to the event.\xc2\xa0 It will be about 200 -- there will be about 200 leaders in space; members of Congress; workers.\xc2\xa0 And the President will outline his bold and ambitious space initiative.</p>\n<p>Then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go on to -- oh, and the members who will be there include Bill Nelson and Kosmas, of course, and Representatives Bill Posey, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.*\xc2\xa0 And then this evening in Miami we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a private -- a fundraiser in a private home, and then -- be about 100 people -- and then another at 6:30 p.m. at the arts center, which will be about 800 people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are those both DNC?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\xe2\x80\x99m not 100 percent sure.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m almost certain, but let me double-check that for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the question?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 If it was DNC.\xc2\xa0 Just want to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not joint or something like that -- mislead you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both DNC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Schedule said DNC.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about the evolution of the bold space plan?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is something that was done in consultation with leaders in space, members of Congress; obviously the President\xe2\x80\x99s advisors on science.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels that he\xe2\x80\x99s come to a program that will create more innovation for our country, that will create more jobs than the trajectory we\xe2\x80\x99re currently on, and there will be more [astronauts in space].</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a feeling when the budget came out that you needed to add a little more specifics --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that we go through, and in consultations with members of Congress what we were able to do is find ways that we could improve upon the plan, take a look at some of the programs that worked and that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, like with the Constellation program, use the things that were working, and do away with the things that weren\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>So the President thinks that his plan is the right one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there going to be any specifics, any additional specifics announced today beyond what you\xe2\x80\x99ve already put out?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a lot more in the way of specifics.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll get some fact sheets that help to flesh out some of the details, but that will be about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just go back to the PERAB stuff real quick?\xc2\xa0 Will the President be making public remarks?\xc2\xa0 And forgive me if I missed that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably -- the coverage plans are still being determined.\xc2\xa0 They may have determined them since we took off, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re expecting the President to talk about derivatives in front of the cameras?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that you can expect that the President is going to make remarks in some fashion or another, be it at a pool spray or something else.\xc2\xa0 When we land I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on what the latest is and make sure you know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given some of the concerns about NASA cuts and the proposals, does the President feel like he needs to make any sort of -- do any convincing today?\xc2\xa0 And what sort of -- what does he anticipate from the crowd?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that every time we put out a new policy, especially when we\xe2\x80\x99re changing course to some extent, it requires a lot of explanation.\xc2\xa0 So you can bet that the President is going to be -- explain it in detail why we made the -- why he made the decisions that he made and why we didn\xe2\x80\x99t take other directions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The space program that was in place when he came into office had made some determinations about the direction of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s space policies that the President thought could be refined and moved in a different direction.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be explaining that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then also I think that folks in Florida and people who are a part of this space program all over the country obviously have a lot at stake here.\xc2\xa0 And, you know, take for example the decision that was made six years ago to end the shuttle program.\xc2\xa0 As a result of that, a lot of people are going to lose their jobs.</p>\n<p>What the President will talk about today is the $40 million fund that he has to help train those workers and help them transition into other ways of work.\xc2\xa0 Obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of solace for someone who\xe2\x80\x99s losing their job, but he\xe2\x80\x99s serious about making sure that these Americans get back to work.</p>\n<p>I would also point you to a story in the Orlando Sentinel today that gives a sense of what kind of reaction we might get, and I think that, if you look at the headline, that this program gives some hope to the people of Florida about the direction of space.\xc2\xa0 I think that that answers your question about the reception.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the audience contain any of those workers who are concerned about their jobs, may be losing jobs?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically what workers will be there, but you probably will have a chance to talk to some of them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious who he -- how he selected who he\xe2\x80\x99s addressing.\xc2\xa0 And if part of this is to try to explain what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, will the audience itself include some of the people that have most at stake?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there certainly will be workers from the Kennedy Space Center who will be there.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if specifically there are going to be workers who are going to be losing their jobs or transitioning to something else, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to see them when we get there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Florida politics come into play here?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think what -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that good policy is good politics.\xc2\xa0 So what he did was he talked to experts, he talked to the people that he trusts on these issues, and he came up with what he thought was the best plan.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s convinced that the people of Florida and the folks who are really interested in our space program are going to see the truth, which is that it is the best direction for the space program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sally Ride, in her essay that you all distributed, talks about how the Constellation never really captured the public\xe2\x80\x99s imagination.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to have something for the public\xe2\x80\x99s imagination today?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you be the judge of that, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a look at the remarks and I certainly think so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the thing in Iceland, the volcano, with all the flight cancellations, whether the President will still travel to Poland?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re keeping an eye on.\xc2\xa0 Right now our schedule is still on.\xc2\xa0 We have every intention of making it to Poland.\xc2\xa0 I talked to some of the folks in the Air Force before I came back here and they feel confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make that trip.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re watching and obviously cognizant of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then China\xe2\x80\x99s decision to I guess divest some U.S. Treasury bonds -- what\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a matter like that here, but I would refer you to the Department of Treasury where you can probably get some more information about what their view of that is.</p>\n<p>Anybody else?\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Bill.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>*Senator Nelson, Representative Kosmas, and Sheila Jackson Lee will be at Kennedy Space Center.\xc2\xa0 Representatives Kosmas and Debbie Wasserman Schultz will be in Miami.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
