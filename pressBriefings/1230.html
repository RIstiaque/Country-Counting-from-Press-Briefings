EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ So tell us what it was like in there. You were just standing around a friend of yours and -- just put it in your terms.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Okay, well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go, and then you\xe2\x80\x99ll go -- okay. Well, we were very excited that we were even going to have the chance of getting to visit her hospital room. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know when we first came whether we had that opportunity. And so when we did have the chance, we were so excited to get to see her. And when we came in the room, the doctor was there, her parents were there, Mark is there, and the Speaker -- Speaker Pelosi and Debbie and I went in.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we just were so excited, so we were telling her how proud we were of her and how she was inspiring the whole nation with her courage and with her strength. And then Debbie and I started joking about all the things we were going to do after she got better. And we were holding her hand and she was responding to our hand-holding. She was rubbing our hands and gripping our hands so we could -- she could really -- we knew she could hear and understand what we were saying and she moved her leg, and so we knew she was responding. And the more we joked about what we were going to do, she started to open her eyes literally.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then you have to recognize, her eyes hadn\xe2\x80\x99t opened -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- and so she started to struggle. And one of her eyes is covered with a bandage because it was damaged in the gunfire. So her eye is flickering. And Mark sees this and gets extremely excited. And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what that meant. And so he said, Gabby, open your eyes, open your eyes. And he\xe2\x80\x99s really urging her forward. And the doctor is like perking up and everyone is coming around the bed. And she\xe2\x80\x99s struggling and she\xe2\x80\x99s struggling and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good -- we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure it out, maybe 30 seconds, where she\xe2\x80\x99s really trying to get her eyes open, like doing this, this, this.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then she finally opens her eyes and you could she was like desperately trying to focus and it took enormous strength from her. And Mark could just -- can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s so happy. And we\xe2\x80\x99re crying because we\xe2\x80\x99re witnessing something that we never imagined would happen in front of us.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so Mark says, he says -- he said, Gabby, if you can see me, give us the thumbs up, give us the thumbs up. And so we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting and we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting and --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And she didn\xe2\x80\x99t at first.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: And we just thought, okay -- and you could watch -- when you\xe2\x80\x99re watching her eyes, she\xe2\x80\x99s really trying to focus. Like you could see she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t opened her eyes in days. And then instead of giving the thumbs up, she literally raises her whole arm like this -- like this. It was unbelievable. And then she reaches out and starts grabbing Mark and is touching him and starts to nearly choke him -- she was clearly trying to hug him.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so like -- she was -- it was such a moment. And we were just in tears of joy watching this and beyond ourselves, honestly. And then Mark said, you know, touch my ring, touch my ring. And she touches his ring and then she grabs his whole watch and wrist. And then the doctor was just so excited. He said, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, this is amazing, what\xe2\x80\x99s she\xe2\x80\x99s doing right now, and beyond our greatest hopes.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so then they decided we had to go because it was a lot -- (laughter) -- of excitement for her and it was -- we just told her how proud we were and how much we loved her and said we\xe2\x80\x99d visit soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, Gabby, you should describe a little about how you felt --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: You know what, she keeps -- she\xe2\x80\x99s been calling me Gabby the whole day. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Debbie has to tell you --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: That\xe2\x80\x99s the sixth time she\xe2\x80\x99s called me Gabby. (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Debbie has to tell you about what she said after because the way she -- the way Debbie phrased it was I thought very amazing.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: It was just -- really, it felt like a miracle. It felt like we were watching a miracle. And Kirsten is totally right -- we just both wanted so badly to be there for her as her friends. We wanted to do -- we wanted to be there for Mark and for her parents. And just the strength that you could see just flowing out of her to get -- it was like she was trying to will her eyes open. It was just -- I mean, it felt --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Debbie, you should say about -- when you had your children -- that it was like the only experience that\xe2\x80\x99s similar is when you have a child.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Exactly. The only way I could describe the feeling that we had, that I had, was other than the birth of my kids, this was the most incredible feeling, to see literally your -- one of your closest friends just struggle to come back to you, to come back to her family, to come back to her friends. I mean, we know how strong Gabby is and you could see all the strength pouring out of her to touch her husband --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: And to tell us she\xe2\x80\x99s there. Like she was -- it was -- you imagine this when you watch a movie, but it\xe2\x80\x99s like she wanted to tell us, I\xe2\x80\x99m here, I can hear you, I\xe2\x80\x99m with you, and I appreciate everything you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We told her -- when Kirsten was talking to her, she said -- because she and her husband had just gone and had pizza with Gabby and Mark, so she said, you know, come on -- come on, Gabby, you got to get going here, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go out for pizza. The last couple of summers, Gabby and Mark and Mark\xe2\x80\x99s kids have vacationed with my family and I in New Hampshire. And I said, Gabby, we fully expect you to be up and ready to go to come back up to New Hampshire this summer, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when she started to open her eye. And the Speaker was talking to her this whole time. We just kept alternately talking to her.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd literally the doctor said, no, you don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, this is really, really significant progress. He starts pounding out a message on his BlackBerry. Her mother and father are just crying. When we -- when they finally pretty much kicked us out because, you know, obviously --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: It was a lot of excitement.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: A lot of excitement, she had to rest. We told her how much we loved her and we\xe2\x80\x99d be back to see her and whatever she needed us to do, we\xe2\x80\x99d be here for her. And we went out, Dr. Lemole, who is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s been on TV and has been so good about explaining everything, he literally said to us, you know, I\xe2\x80\x99ve discounted -- on TV, I\xe2\x80\x99ve discounted emotion being -- and friendship and family -- really, I\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of discounted that as meaningless out loud. He said, I just witnessed the impact of friendship and what you guys -- he said, you did this here today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ That was not the doctor in the room; that was a different one?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Different doctor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Different doctor. And what was his name?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I forget.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And just real quick, which hand were you holding?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: I was holding her left hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And it was you who was holding the hand?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULT: We were alternating holding here hand.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what she was doing -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll demonstrate it on your hand. Can you hold this for her?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: So this is Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s hand and I\xe2\x80\x99m just holding it like this and her hand -- she kept doing this, she kept going like that, like her thumb was reacting. And then she squeezed, like she totally was present in every way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ And then when she lifted up her arm, that was her right arm?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: The same one. Same arm. She lifted it up like this -- it was like a whole hand thumbs up.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And he was trying to -- he kept telling her, if you can see -- he said, Gabby, if you can see me, give me a thumbs up sign, give me the thumbs up sign. And then she went -- she pulled up her whole arm.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Whole hand, like that.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Actually, they wanted her to calm down --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: They\xe2\x80\x99re untying her arm because when she started to move more --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: -- involuntary movements --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: -- they wanted to give her the freedom to move so -- her hand had been secured. They unsecured it so she could move freely, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when she brought the whole arm up to do her thumb up. Because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want her to take the --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: The neck tube. She was going back to reach for the breathing tube.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Yes, she obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like the breathing tube.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Clearly uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Could you talk a little bit about the friendship between -- among the three of you and how you got to know each other? We talked on the phone about this the other day a little bit, but I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in knowing a little bit more from you guys about the bond that you share.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think I told you the other day, I mean, there\xe2\x80\x99s very few of us --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Young women.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: -- young women who -- so we naturally gravitate to each other. And Kirsten and I were -- I was assigned as Kirsten\xe2\x80\x99s mentor when she --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Before I ran for office in 2006, I called Debbie and she gave me advice about what was it like to have young children and serve in Congress. So Debbie was instrumental in making me feel comfortable before I even ran for office to be able to know that I could be a good mom and a good legislator at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: So literally right from when I was elected, these were my two girlfriends. I mean, I met Gabby before I was elected, Kirsten before she was elected -- or Gabby before she -- both of them before they were elected.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Well, you ran Red to Blue.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Right.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: She ran Red to Blue --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: The year they were elected, right.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: So that\xe2\x80\x99s how we -- so were entwined in many ways. But Gabby and I were on Armed Services together as freshmen members after we won in 2006. And what I admired about her so much is the way she brought something different to our committee. I always complimented Speaker Pelosi because one way she transformed Congress was she put five women on the Armed Services Committee all at one year. And our nature of our questions were always different.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd one thing Gabby always focused on was the well-being of the troops and their families. And she would talk about how she\xe2\x80\x99d be talking about the troops with the doctor at the military base where she represents, and he would always say, I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned about sending these men and women back into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way when they\xe2\x80\x99re not mentally or physically ready. And so I\xe2\x80\x99d often bring up her stories as evidence that women in Congress matter because we have a different perspective.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then I always wanted to get our husbands together because a lot of -- some of the women don\xe2\x80\x99t have their husbands in D.C., and so -- and as you know, Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s husband is an astronaut so he travels all the time. So we always talk about, we got to double date, double date, double date. So we started to do these double dates and her husband is one of the most charming men in the world. He\xe2\x80\x99s not only brilliant and fascinating and an astronaut, but he\xe2\x80\x99s a nice person and they love each other so clearly.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what they seem to enjoy most about each other as a couple is how interesting each other -- each of the other one is. And so they take their New Years and they go to the renaissance weekend and they were telling me all about their New Years and the different speakers. And both of them were like finishing each other\xe2\x80\x99s sentences.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: The best way to describe them --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Clearly in love.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: -- they\xe2\x80\x99re really in a perpetual state of newly-wed. I mean, they really are. Steve and I -- my husband Steve and I met Gabby and Mark because Gabby and I were both chosen for this legislative fellowship, the same one that Trey Grayson was in; we were all in the same fellowship together. And so we were a part of this couple-year fellowship and we travelled around to different places and spent a lot of time together.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then Gabby ran for Congress -- she was a state senator, she ran for Congress. I was the head of the Red to Blue program, so we got to know -- I travelled to Tucson that cycle. Mark\xe2\x80\x99s last shuttle launch, our family went with Mark and Gabby\xe2\x80\x99s family to see the launch. We were able to be there the night before with the family when the shuttle is all lit up at night. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had them in New Hampshire for the last couple summers.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then as far as social time -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of social time -- but like I said, we gravitate to each other so Gabby is one of the girlfriends that I spend time with after -- I mean, we really miss Kirsten because she\xe2\x80\x99s on the other side of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: -- I had planned and we had lunch, a ladies lunch at the Senate dining room.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: She had us all over.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Gabby, Debbie, and Stephanie -- it was the four of us.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Yes, Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, Kirsten, Gabby and I all had lunch --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: I just wanted them, I missed them so much -- I was like, you have to come have lunch with me.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: It was great.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Moving back to the hospital room just a little bit, once the eyes were open, was she smiling? Can you describe her --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: No, she has a tube in her mouth. No, she can\xe2\x80\x99t move her face.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No expression. No expression. She just --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t because of the equipment. Even if she tried -- I mean, she kept pursing her lips and I felt like she was trying to talk, but she has the breathing apparatus in her mouth so she can\xe2\x80\x99t really --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But you could see -- you could clearly see the determination in her face that she was struggling to get her eyes open because she was responding to our voices. It was like she wanted us to know that she knew we were -- that we were there. It was --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: It was raw courage. It was raw strength. It was so beautiful and so moving. And, I mean, as I said, we were in tears. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe our eyes how courageous she was and how much she wanted to talk to us, that she wanted to -- she wanted us to know that she was with us a hundred percent and understood everything we were saying and appreciated it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Can you talk a little bit about what you were told kind of going into the hospital, what you were expecting?</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: They didn\xe2\x80\x99t really tell us a whole lot. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t warn us about anything. I mean, I had spoken to Mark on the phone and he kind of gave me an idea a couple days ago of what she looked like -- I mean, where there was a big scar and what bandages there were and things like that. So I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so -- actually she looked --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: She looked beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: She did look beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Absolutely beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And she looked not anything like you would imagine someone with a gunshot wound to the head would look. She looked angelic, I have to tell you. It was stunning. I mean, she -- the strength that she has is -- we were already aware of, but it clearly -- I mean, it just resonates all the way through her.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Describe the room a little bit for us.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Well, if you ever have a chance to talk to her mother, you can understand where Gabby gets it from, because her mother was just sparkling with pride and her own level of determination and will.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re bordering on violating her privacy now by describing -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into what she looked like or, you know, the --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: Between her mother and Mark, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt -- both Debbie and I know Gabby has the courage and strength it will take to recover from this. We know her spirit is indomitable. We know she\xe2\x80\x99s got the kind of conviction that it would take someone to recover from this kind of incident. But when I finally met her mother, I knew where it came from because her mother says, of course she\xe2\x80\x99s getting better, of course she\xe2\x80\x99s going to be walking soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when I talked to Mark two days ago -- both Debbie and I have been sharing this story -- he said, Gabby is going to be walking. I told the doctor that Gabby would be walking on two weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: A couple, two weeks. He said the same thing to both of us.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: And so when Mark told to both Debbie and I the story, we said --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Separately, and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know that we both had talked to him.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: So you can understand the world she\xe2\x80\x99s in. There\xe2\x80\x99s the people who are around who believe in her, who know of her strength, and we just feel so lucky that we could have been a small part of this -- of the hope that I think the whole nation has for her future.</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: She\xe2\x80\x99s totally enveloped by the love of her family, of her friends, of her constituents, and now the whole nation. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely clear that all that energy has been felt by her.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you. We really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What was the name of the pizza place where you were joking about going back to?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: We went to --</p>\n<p>\n\tREPRESENTATIVE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Matchbox.</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: It was Matchbox.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ The Matchbox on the Hill or --</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: On H Street. (Laughter.) They have really good pizza.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ What\xe2\x80\x99s her favorite pizza?</p>\n<p>\n\tSENATOR GILLIBRAND: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but then -- the funny thing about the dinner was we were supposed to go to a more conservative, fancy restaurant and when I saw it on the schedule, I said, no, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the mood. So I called Gabby and I say, where do you want to go? And I talked to her scheduler and I gave her four options of restaurants I knew were good. They picked Matchbox and they had been there the night before, so they really like it. (Laughter.) And they had had pizza the night before so -- it\xe2\x80\x99s Mark\xe2\x80\x99s favorite. It\xe2\x80\x99s his favorite restaurant.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ Thank you both very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:31 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
