EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome back aboard Press Force One, as we begin our bus tour, two-day bus tour.\xc2\xa0 It\'s always a pleasure to see you.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, and that makes me happy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Jen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any real announcements.\xc2\xa0 So since we\'re in Florida, in the spirit of that, I just thought I\'d tick through a couple facts about Florida for you guys.\xc2\xa0 One, on Thursday evening, during the President\'s speech, they held nearly 900 house parties across the state to watch his speech.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMedicare, as you know the President talked about today, and he talks about regularly out there -- as we all know, there\'s a large senior population in Florida.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve put out reports on this in the past, but more than 238,000 Floridians with Medicare have already seen cuts in their cost of their prescription drugs. So I wanted to make sure you had that number.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Voters can register until October 9th in Florida.\xc2\xa0 And in the state, we\'ve been outspent by Republicans and the Republican super PACs by about $10 million.\xc2\xa0 So keep that in mind.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo those are just a few stats, and we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question.\xc2\xa0 You\'re going to Melbourne tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Do we assume that there\'s going to be a big NASA focus there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates on the President\'s remarks or what he\'ll talk about.\xc2\xa0 He will -- as you know, the President has a plan for the space program.\xc2\xa0 That\'s more than Mitt Romney and his team can say.\xc2\xa0 So there certainly is a contrast.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let you know if there\'s any update on his remarks, if he\'ll be addressing that tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd just to add -- I know Adam is here -- I don\'t know if you guys all know Adam, but he\'s the Florida expert in the crew. But obviously a number of our stops are along the I-4 corridor, where the Latino population has been growing.\xc2\xa0 The demographics in the state in this area have been moving more towards supporters of the President and his agenda.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll also be visiting areas over the course of the next two days where we haven\'t won traditionally in the past.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s a mix through the course of the bus tour.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Melbourne is one of the (inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 What\'s the thinking in terms of going into territory that\'s not typically yours?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we spend a lot of time, as you know, in parts of states like Florida, but also states like Colorado and Ohio, where we may not have won the vote four years ago, and there may be more voters who are leaning towards our opponent, but these are still places where we feel we can not only energize our supporters but also make an appeal to soft supporters of our opponent on issues like the economy and middle-class tax cuts, on issues like Medicare and the dramatic cuts that the Romney/Ryan budget would propose.\xc2\xa0 And we feel every moment of time we spend is worth it, even in places where we didn\xe2\x80\x99t win four years ago because we need to still energize and excite the voters we turned out four years ago and build on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, now that people have had a chance to digest yesterday\'s unemployment report a little bit more than when it first came out, what are your concerns about the impact of it, and sort of the drip, drip effect there\'s going to be another one and then another one just four days before Election Day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President made a very strong case on Thursday night for the choice he\'s offering the American people when it comes to the economy and the plans he\'s presenting to move the economy forward.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\'s proposed a number of pieces in the American Jobs Act that Republicans and Mitt Romney could get behind right now.\xc2\xa0 And independent economists have said that would create 1 million more jobs.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to talk about those on the campaign trail.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know most people are not sitting at home clicking "refresh" on the BLS website; they\'re concerned about how things are impacting them.\xc2\xa0 Do they have health care?\xc2\xa0 Can they send their kids to college?\xc2\xa0 Are they able to get a job?\xc2\xa0 Can their small business get access to the loans and assistance they need? That\'s what the President will be talking about.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what he\'s been talking about and what he will be between now and November.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And if I could just say as a matter of policy, because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- the jobs report represented the 30th straight month that we\'ve had private sector job growth, for a total of 4.6 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 That stands in stark contrast to the situation that existed in the country when President Obama was sworn into office.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when we talk about simply policy comparisons, proposals that are designed to keep the country moving forward, continue to have economic growth and job creation, and to increase that growth and job creation, what the President believes in and what he\'s putting forward -- and there is a useful comparison here because the recession was not that long ago.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not asking people to reach back and look at policy proposals from the \'70s or \'80s.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about what was in place four years ago and led to the worst economic crisis in the lifetime of everybody on this bus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are your concerns, though, Jay, from a policy standpoint that the job creation, the 96,000 jobs reflected in this report was not as strong as many economists originally thought it would be, and the fact that unemployment notched down a bit because fewer people are looking for work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First, we never react too happily to job reports that exceed expectations or too negatively to job reports that come in below expectations because we are focused on trends.\xc2\xa0 You may recall that in the earlier part of this year we had a series of months where these same reports came in significantly above expectations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is that we need to continue moving in one direction, which is forward, and that\'s positive job growth, positive economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The President is the first one to say -- you heard him say it today and he said it yesterday and the day before -- that we\'re not anywhere close to where we need to be in this economy because the hole that was dug by the recession was so deep.\xc2\xa0 And he wants to not just settle for the status quo for the middle class that existed prior to the recession; he was running in 2008 on the idea that the middle class was already under intense pressure and needed help.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Jen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I was going to add one thing.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney has been out there talking about his plan to create 12 million jobs that\'s lacking in any concrete detail on exactly how he\'s going to get there.\xc2\xa0 We know that from the American Jobs Act, which I referenced, that would create a million jobs.\xc2\xa0 We know the Romney/Ryan budget independent economists have said could cost a million jobs.\xc2\xa0 So next year alone, we\'re talking about a difference between President Obama\'s plan that could put 2 million people back to work more than Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s plan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd ultimately, I think people across Florida, people across this country are looking at the difference -- the choice in this election, the difference between what they\'re presenting and what their priorities are.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to bring into focus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would either of you give us an idea, since yesterday was the first day in a long time that the full ticket was campaigning together, any color about how they were?\xc2\xa0 Were they buoyant?\xc2\xa0 Were they revved up from the campaign?\xc2\xa0 Anything that we didn\'t see behind the scenes -- and then also just bring it into today, the President is on another bus tour, it\xe2\x80\x99s Florida -- does he seem fired up and ready to go?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The President loves nothing more than bus tours.\xc2\xa0 He loves --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s true.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And the campaigning.\xc2\xa0 The President absolutely loves bus tours because you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting on and off of a plane. You\'re actually spending time in the state of Florida.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make some local stops.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to go to places where people are having lunch, where they\'re working, where they\'re spending their Saturday afternoon, and have individual conversations that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take back with him for weeks to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is our third bus tour since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been back, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve done them in Iowa and Ohio.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more of between now and November.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0In terms of color, you may --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 It obviously creates a lot of energy when you have the President and the Vice President together, and in this case, even more energy because you had the First Lady and Dr. Biden.\xc2\xa0 There were a couple of really nice moments that I noticed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Before they -- before the President went out, there was a little tent backstage, but outside, a small, little tent.\xc2\xa0 And I know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where was this?\xc2\xa0 Which stop?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 First event.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The first event.\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President and President were just sitting next to each other, sort of heads together, talking, and just very intimately -- no other staff were around.\xc2\xa0 And you could tell they were catching up because they have both been on a busy schedule traveling separately.\xc2\xa0 And you just really -- you could tell that they were both feeling very good about the night before, and the overall convention.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0And then there was a nice moment inside in a really, lovely historic building that served as a hold where I noticed that the First Lady and Dr. Biden and some others were catching up, as well, prior to the event.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0What you can definitely say about having worked for both men, that these are -- family is a dominant theme for both the Obamas and the Bidens.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that I know the two men speak about a lot, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the First Lady and Dr. Biden do, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Charlie Crist campaigned for you guys today.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, his Florida career in the Republican Party was doomed somewhat by that famous photo from 2009.\xc2\xa0 I noticed they hugged again today.\xc2\xa0 Were there one -- were there any similar discussions with the two of them backstage?\xc2\xa0 And two, what do you think Charlie Crist brings to the campaign?\xc2\xa0 And how is he helpful, given all the history?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The only thing the President loves more than a bus tour is a hug, so -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Charlie Crist has -- the speech he gave the other night at the convention made a strong case for why moving past partisan politics, supporting the person who you believe is the right one to lead the country forward, is one of the reasons why people should get behind President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has widespread appeal in the state with independent voters, with women, with seniors.\xc2\xa0 He can make a strong case for people who know him well, partisan politics aside, about why the President is a better person to protect against voucherizing Medicare, why he\xe2\x80\x99s the right person to protect against Republican attempts to challenge a woman from being able to make choices about her own health care.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s expressed a willingness to be out there for the President.\xc2\xa0 I expect he will be over the next two months.\xc2\xa0 And we think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be a help to our efforts in Florida.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, yesterday the campaign and today the DNC have been making an issue out of the comments that Governor Romney made about Steve King in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a kind of usual acknowledgement that a politician makes when they\'re making a local campaign, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President -- is the President going to be held to the same standard when acknowledging people in the audience who may have some views that he doesn\'t necessarily agree with to result in this connection that you guys are making that they are partners in extremism?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you are, and you can be defined, by the people you surround yourself by.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney gave a rousing endorsement of Steve King and said he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody he absolutely needs in Washington.\xc2\xa0 So that is a bit more than just acknowledging he\xe2\x80\x99s in the audience.\xc2\xa0 I think the point here is that there is a clear difference between what Todd Akin, what Steve King, and what some others in the most extreme right wing of the party are standing for and representing when it comes to women\xe2\x80\x99s health care.\xc2\xa0 And to kind of wrap his arms around him, it just raises the question of who he\xe2\x80\x99s surrounding himself with.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Romney is campaigning in Virginia today with Governor Allen.\xc2\xa0 Does Governor Allen bring anything to his support in Virginia?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think in Virginia, people are going to be making the decision between -- on the presidential ticket level\xc2\xa0 -- what President Obama represents and what Mitt Romney represents.\xc2\xa0 We know there\xe2\x80\x99s a very competitive Senate race, and the President has a strong and longstanding relationship with Tim Kaine, of course.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in the state, and I think people are going to be deciding between each of the tickets for the most part.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on some of the things the President said at the rally in Seminole?\xc2\xa0 So he said that on Medicare he would never just dump costs on to seniors, and on Social Security that he would never reform it by turning it over to Wall Street. He certainly implied that that\'s what he thinks Mitt Romney would do, but he didn\'t say it directly.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that that\'s what Mitt Romney would do?\xc2\xa0 Or was he just talking more broadly about Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As far as the policy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 While Mitt Romney has said that he would -- and this is policy we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about -- he has said he won\xe2\x80\x99t tell the American people any specifics about how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay for a $5 trillion tax cut, he and his running mate have been abundantly clear about what their plans for Medicare are. Abundantly clear.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOutside analysts have said that the implementation of that plan would result -- in turning Medicare into a voucher, would save money by shifting costs to seniors, not by reducing health care costs, but by raising costs, out-of-pocket expenses for seniors.\xc2\xa0 That\'s simply a fact.\xc2\xa0 The President opposes that, adamantly.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe only reason why you would need to do that is in order to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 You can strengthen Medicare, and the President already has, and make sure that the benefits that seniors have long enjoyed through Medicare are preserved.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what the President is committed to doing.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Social Security, Governor [Congressman} Ryan has supported a plan, both of his own and then the President\xe2\x80\x99s [Bush], that did turn in full or in part Social Security over to Wall Street.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ryan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congressman Ryan.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I have -- that\'s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s also the wrong policy and entirely unnecessary unless you need that money, you need the savings extracted out of our seniors in order to pay for tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just add -- Jay obviously did a thorough review of the policy -- but the most important decision Mitt Romney has made is picking his running mate, and that tells you something about not only his priorities, but the kind of leadership that he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for to join him in the White House. And Jay was very clear about Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s record on these issues, and they have not backed away from their support for voucherizing Medicare, and have said that they think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right step.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Facts are facts.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Facts are facts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aside from the guidance we have for next week, any idea if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing more bus trips here or elsewhere?\xc2\xa0 And in particular, next weekend, do you expect him to be down, or do you expect him to be on the road?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling updates to provide.\xc2\xa0 When we have them, we will.\xc2\xa0 Like Jen said, I know this mode of campaigning and moving around the country is very appealing to the President.\xc2\xa0 And I think it goes to some of the earlier questions about why you go certain places.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that is useful about a bus trip is it allows you to go to towns and places that are hard to reach when you\xe2\x80\x99re flying in a 747.\xc2\xa0 And the President particularly enjoys that aspect of it.<br/>\n\tBut we just don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make in terms of modes or sites of future travel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to note on this Saturday in September, weekend in September, that we are at that annual moment of sublime convergence where you have college football, the NFL, and the end of the baseball season leading into the post-season.\xc2\xa0 There is no finer time in American sports.\xc2\xa0 And I know the President will be enjoying all that is on offer, as will I.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a prediction on the NFL season, a Super Bowl prediction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is a Bears fan all the way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But who does he think will win?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him, but I know he bets on the Bears.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All that is on offer -- on the satellite on the bus, you mean?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the bus is like the plane.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve told you all that when there\xe2\x80\x99s a TV on in his presence, it tends to be ESPN.\xc2\xa0 And this morning, we were talking -- we were all having a chat on the bus, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I was briefing him on football and where things are.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We weren\xe2\x80\x99t watching TV.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, that tends to be in the background most times.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of betting does he do on the Bears?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Do you want to get in on a bet?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a suicide pool?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no money bets.\xc2\xa0 But his heart is firmly with the Bears.\xc2\xa0 And, look, they\xe2\x80\x99re strong I think actually this year.\xc2\xa0 They have a remarkable running back.\xc2\xa0 I think Cutler is very strong.\xc2\xa0 So as an observer -- not a Bears fan, but as an observer, I think the Bears could be a real contender.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0And the White Sox are hanging in there, as the President reminds me every day.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m changing the subject from sports, but is this the first time that Obama has been in Florida since Ryan was added to the Romney ticket?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have we been here?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s all a blur.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I thought we had been here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We can check.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll double-check for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you do a quick Latino question -- so how much of the Orlando stop is about the Puerto Rican vote?\xc2\xa0 And is that -- I know he wants to appeal to all voters and all Latino voters and stuff, but can you talk about the importance of the Puerto Rican vote in Florida, sort of as a counter to the Cuban American vote?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if Jay was going to jump in.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no -- that\xe2\x80\x99s purely electoral.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There are -- as I mentioned earlier, there are changing demographics in Florida, as there are in many states across the country, and there certain has been a growth in Orlando in the I-4 corridor in the Latino population.\xc2\xa0 Because of the difference between the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies -- he has been a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform, he has taken steps to ensure that children are able to stay here and go to college and been really a very strong advocate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0On the flip side, Mitt Romney has the most extreme position of almost any candidate in modern American history on immigration.\xc2\xa0 And he has not taken steps to lay out not only what we need to do to address the problem, but he has also said he would veto the DREAM Act, and taken steps that I think have given pause to many who care deeply about issues like immigration, which is the Latino population, but also far beyond that in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0We know also that issues like education, health care, economy are also very large issues in the Latino community.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about those, as he consistently does, tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But certainly, we are visiting parts of the state where we know we can continue to build our support, we know we can energize supporters.\xc2\xa0 And that demographic is one of them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I could just add as a matter of policy -- it\xe2\x80\x99s particularly interesting I think to readers of Bloomberg -- is that immigration reform, comprehensive immigration reform, must and will, if this President is reelected, include measures that will enhance the capacity of our businesses, American enterprises, to retain the very best talent.\xc2\xa0 And that will help us grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 And that has to be part of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why the President feels so strongly about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Immigration, though, is not a direct issue for the Puerto Rican population.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I was talking about the Latino population in Florida broadly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, did you have a specific question about how we\xe2\x80\x99re appealing --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you targeting Puerto Rican voters in Orlando?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I think there are many demographics in the state that will make up the group of people that we think will help us win the state.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly is one of them.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, obviously the difference on immigration for many other Latino voters in the state, the difference on women\xe2\x80\x99s health care, the difference on Medicare and Social Security -- these are all issues that will help us make Florida blue again.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We all know that Florida has this large elderly population, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether the Medicare issue resonates -- well, first of all, whether the elderly population is pretty much locked in, if that\xe2\x80\x99s a voting bloc that\xe2\x80\x99s already partisan, and whether the Medicare argument reaches to a different voting bloc, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s 50-year-old men or -- are you guys looking at that in that particular way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0MS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about which demographics we\xe2\x80\x99re targeting.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re right that it is beyond the population of seniors over 65. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of the issues that we highlight, because it speaks to also the priorities of the candidates.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s alarming to people when they hear that costs could go up on prescription drugs, that costs could go up on their health care plans.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly impacts people who are not only in retirement, but are nearing retirement and looking ahead to their future, and even the children of people who are in retirement and nearing retirement and looking to the future of their parents and grandparents.\xc2\xa0 So it is a message that I think resonates beyond just the people who are currently in retirement, currently recipients of Medicare.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important when you talk about repealing health care reform to note that the consequence of that would be to bring about, according to the independent experts, the insolvency of Medicare eight years sooner.\xc2\xa0 If you repeal Obamacare, the experts say, Medicare would begin to be insolvent in 2016.\xc2\xa0 And that should be -- and I know is -- a concern to not just today\xe2\x80\x99s seniors, but men and women in their --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Rising seniors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- rising seniors in their 50s and 60s.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is so committed to strengthening the program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:33 P.M.
