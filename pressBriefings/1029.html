WITA</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Love your hotel.\xc2\xa0 I have with me today the National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon, who\'s here -- he can take your questions, give you a brief summary.\xc2\xa0 First he\'ll give you a summary of the trip and its accomplishments, and then take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben Rhodes and I will be here, too, if you have questions that we can take that Tom wants to defer to us on.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, and no further ado, Tom Donilon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Good to see everybody.\xc2\xa0 First of all, let me say thanks for the commitment of your news organizations to cover this trip.\xc2\xa0 I know it\'s expensive and it takes a lot of commitment on your part as well, and it\'s much appreciated -- because this trip has obviously had a tremendous amount of coverage and thoughtful commentary.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just appreciated.\xc2\xa0 I know in this day and age, it\'s a lot to do.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s a lot to do for you and your families as well.\xc2\xa0 It\'s much appreciated, as I said.</p>\n<p>\n\tI was just going to make four observations about the trip.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard a lot from Ben and the area substance folks on our trip during the course of it and I think you\'re familiar with the general laydown.\xc2\xa0 But I thought it might be useful for me to just take a few minutes to make four or five observations about the trip.\xc2\xa0 And then I\'ll be glad to take your questions on the trip or anything else that you want to talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\tObservation number one, on strategy:\xc2\xa0 What we\'ve seen in this trip is the implementation of a substantial and important reorientation in American global strategy.\xc2\xa0 That is the rebalancing of our efforts towards the challenges and opportunities in Asia on the part of the United States.\xc2\xa0 Now -- and the President, I think, best summarized this in his Canberra speech before the Australian parliament, when he said the United States is all in.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what you\'ve seen during the course of this trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis has been an effort that we\'ve had underway, as many of you know, since our transition into office.\xc2\xa0 During that transition, we had the opportunity to ask ourselves the following questions:\xc2\xa0 Where are the opportunities of the future?\xc2\xa0 Where are we currently, as the President comes into office, underweighted and overweighted with respect to U.S. effort?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the conclusion that we reached, among others, is that we were substantially underweighted in terms of our engagement and resource allocation and attention to Asia.\xc2\xa0 And we have been about a three-year effort to address that.\xc2\xa0 And we call this rebalancing -- strategic rebalancing, which I\'ve talked to a number of you about over the course of the last three years, as we\'ve laid this out and implemented this during the course of the President\'s three trips to Asia and many things in between, obviously.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, it was born of the observation that we were underweighted in Asia, given the importance of the region, given the economic dynamism in the region, and the strategic dynamics in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we set about, through three lines of quite specific work, to address that underweighting.\xc2\xa0 And they were these:\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, to strengthen our alliances and security partnerships in the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAlliances are critical for the United States around the world.\xc2\xa0 Alliances are an essential strategic asset for the United States around the world.\xc2\xa0 They are very different than coalitions of the willing.\xc2\xa0 And they are to be valued by the United States\xc2\xa0 -- and we do that, and we\'ve done that in Europe, and we\'ve done that in Asia.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, over the last two weeks the United States has -- the President has met face-to-face with each of our Asia treaty allies, and engaged in really the continuing work to strengthen those alliances.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNo other nation in the world has the alliance system that the United States has around the world, and it is, I said, a strategic asset of the United States, and one that in this region and around the world we have undertaken to strengthen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur alliances in Asia today are as strong as they have ever been.\xc2\xa0 And if you look through the state visit that President Lee and the South Koreans had in the United States, if you look through our work with Japan over the last three years, and you look at the comments from the Japanese government -- if you look at the demand signal for American leadership in the region, I think it\'s pretty clear that the alliances are in good shape in the region -- I think in the best shape they\'ve been in in a long time -- and the demand signal for U.S. leadership in the region is very high right now, for a variety of reasons that we can discuss.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second line of work we undertook with respect to strategy in Asia was to engage intensively with the emerging power centers in the region -- like China and India and Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 We have been intensively engaged with these nations, and you saw that during the course of this trip.\xc2\xa0 The President had has 10th face-to-face meeting -- that\'s hard to say -- the President had his 10th face-to-face meeting with President Hu Jintao in Hawaii this past week.\xc2\xa0 We had, yesterday, a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Singh of India, following up on, really, the historic three-day trip that the President had a year ago this month in India.\xc2\xa0 And of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re hosted here by the Indonesians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe frequency, the depth of these engagements I think have really paid off.\xc2\xa0 And, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States presence in this region, the United States with an affirmative agenda in this region that is critical.\xc2\xa0 And I think the level of engagement, really, with the emerging powers in this region is unprecedented.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third aspect of the strategy -- and you all have heard me talk about it a lot -- is to participate actively and, indeed, help form up the regional multilateral institutions -- the architecture, if you will -- to be all in, as the President said, with respect to building up this architecture -- economic, diplomatic, and security architecture in the region in order to pursue our interest, but the interest of the region as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you can go through this week and have a sense of our vision for the architecture and the development of the architecture, beginning with APEC, where the President hosted 21 economies in Hawaii; the TPP, nine participating, in what we hope will be a fundamental, high-quality trade arrangement in this region, to which other countries will be attracted -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen, as you know, expressions of interest in coming and consulting and joining the TPP by substantial economies in the world; ASEAN -- the 10 ASEAN countries, the ASEAN-United States Summit, which is the third time the President has done this since he came into office; and then, of course, the fundamental decision of the President of the United States to participate at the leader level at the East Asia Summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had a debate in the administration about whether to do this.\xc2\xa0 And this goes back to the first thing I said at the briefing.\xc2\xa0 You can sit back and say, well, is the agenda what we want it to be?\xc2\xa0 Is it really moving in the direction that we think would be most useful for the region?\xc2\xa0 And you could ask those questions and never come in.\xc2\xa0 Or you can decide to be all in, and to come at the summit level and help shape the agenda, and help transform this institution, we hope, into the premier institution in Asia for addressing diplomatic security and other issues in this region.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President did.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he led on.\xc2\xa0 And that was the genesis of the decision and why we are here at this meeting -- and the East Asia Summit is 18 countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can talk for a long time, as a lot of you know, about the strategy here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been on this from the first day we came into office, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to take any questions on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing I wanted to comment on, though, is the scale of the trip.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important to note as well.\xc2\xa0 As I said, APEC, 21 countries, at the meeting chaired by the President; the ASEAN, 10 countries, and obviously, a fast-growing part of the world; TPP, nine countries; the East Asia Summit, 18 countries all in -- the President worked with during the course of this week, some 25 nations in the fastest-growing economic region in the world, had formal bilateral meetings with 10 countries.\xc2\xa0 So the scale of this trip, I think, it is notable.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s direct activity, direct encounter with the leaders of this region on behalf of the United States, I think is notable.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third thing I wanted to make an observation about is the President\'s comments on resources and the really critical statements that he made in the Canberra speech about resources.\xc2\xa0 It\'s one thing to make a declaration on a policy basis that the United States is going to be reengaging in Asia as part of our rebalancing effort -- and by the way, the rebalancing effort has other aspects to it as well -- refocusing on the economy, tightening up our counterterrorism efforts to really focus on the real threats, but critically, here, in terms of regions coming into Asia -- but without the resource dedication, those are just words.\xc2\xa0 And without the activity of the President and the activity of the diplomatic corps and programs, those are just words.\xc2\xa0 And the President went well beyond that during the course of this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndeed, in the Canberra speech, he announced that in the context of our reviewing our budget on the security side for the next 10 years, which is what we\'re doing now under the Budget Control Act -- we\'re looking at the Defense Department budget and the deductions that need to be made under the Budget Control Act. And as you all know, that has a security side and a non-security side.\xc2\xa0 The security side is the side that I work on.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his Canberra speech, he has given clear guidance -- one of the first decisions that he has made with respect to the defense budget over the next 10 years is a strategic decision, and that is that we will allocate the resources necessary to maintain a strong military, security presence in Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are different ways to go about these projects of something of that scale.\xc2\xa0 Essentially what we\'re looking at here is a $489 billion reduction over a 10-year period.\xc2\xa0 You can take a percentage cut across the board, or you can engage in a deep strategic look.\xc2\xa0 And the President chose the latter -- to say, we\'re just not going to have reductions across the board on everything; we\'re going to make choices and we\'re going to decide to do the things we\'re going to do well.\xc2\xa0 And with Asia, that means being all in, and doing the things that are required here with the resources that are necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that was my third observation.\xc2\xa0 Jay told me I could only have four.\xc2\xa0 I had 12 -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He looked out -- he said, based on looking out the window here, if you get past four you\'re going to be lucky.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I\'ll try my best to contain myself about these things.\xc2\xa0 They keep me away from you, you know, almost physically, during the course of these trips.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fourth comment or observation I wanted to make is with respect to trade and the economy.\xc2\xa0 You saw really in direct, concrete terms yesterday the kinds of opportunities that are going to exist in Asia with the announcement of the commercial transactions that the President announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also had a very important stretch here, notable stretch here, for trade policy generally.\xc2\xa0 If you take it from the Korean U.S. Free Trade Agreement through the WTO accession for Russia, through the APEC conference, through the TPP announcement, and the announcement of a number of countries who want to come in to the TPP, it\'s been an extraordinary stretch in terms of trade policy -- and focused on high-quality trade agreements that focus on the sectors of the future and that are fair and really models.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what I wanted to comment on with respect to that.\xc2\xa0 There really is tremendous economic opportunity here.\xc2\xa0 But you have to have an affirmative agenda and lead and put together the kinds of architectures and structures here that you\'ve seen.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, stopping at four points and, in sum, I think that we have seen implementation here of a critical strategic reorientation in policy by the United States, a rebalancing, if you will -- all in, in Asia, for the United States.\xc2\xa0 The region has been looking to it.\xc2\xa0 It has a lot of elements that we can talk about in the question-and-answer period, but nonetheless, from our perspective, we\'ve been able to positively advance each of the key goals that we had for the course of this trip.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s been in the U.S. interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that -- Jay -- I\'ll take questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for doing this.\xc2\xa0 How do you think China is looking at this rebalancing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'d say -- the question was how China is -- how do we think China is looking at this.\xc2\xa0 We look at this from a perspective of our overall Asia policy.\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll get to your question in just a second.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, our view here is that it\'s quite important for our interest and it\'s important for the interest of this region for the United States to put the resources in place, to continue to provide what it\'s provided for the last 60-plus years, which is the foundation, the platform on which you\'ve seen this tremendous rise in economies here and social development.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the Chinese know that.\xc2\xa0 Put simply, the United States has done more with respect to the security platform that it has put in place in Asia over the last six decades -- it has done more to contribute to the economic rise here than any other country.\xc2\xa0 And the Chinese know that.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at their official statements, they recognize, obviously, the United States is a principal Pacific power here.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve also been quite direct with the Chinese about our strategy here, and I think they understand and appreciate that we are going to meet our obligations here, that we are going to meet our commitments to partners and allies, and that we think it\'s in the United States\' interest, obviously, but it\'s also in the interest of the region -- including, ultimately, China\'s interest in terms of us having a solid, stable, peaceful region that allows the kind of development I think that\'s China\'s top priority right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, are partners and allies look to us for that reassurance.\xc2\xa0 They want to know that the United States is going to play the role it\'s played with respect to security and reassurance and balancing and stability here.\xc2\xa0 But they also expect that the United States would engage, as another part of its multidimensional responsibilities in the region, to engage in a productive and constructive relationship with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And they look to us to do that, which is why we have had -- in parallel and as part of our overall Asia strategy -- a deep engagement strategy with the Chinese to manage a range of issues. We have a very complicated and quite substantial relationship with China across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that they understand it in that context.\xc2\xa0 I think that our relationship with China has, in the main, been productive and constructive.\xc2\xa0 We have had economic issues with the Chinese -- and, again, I don\'t, by the way, want to in any way discount the range of issues that we have worked on constructively with the Chinese because they are substantial and -- well, in my area, and I spend as much time with the senior Chinese leadership and policymakers than anyone in our administration -- and we have done a lot of work together with the Chinese.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe do have economic issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President has raised them directly with President Hu.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve been briefed on the conversations that we have, and they are around the appropriate contribution that China needs to make to global growth.\xc2\xa0 And that goes to currency and other kinds of policies -- and the specific areas beyond currency that impair the fair access of the United States and other countries into the Chinese economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the bottom line is I think they understand our strategy.\xc2\xa0 I think that they understand the importance of it for the region.\xc2\xa0 We are, as I\'ve said, just to be totally straight with you, we are in a important conversation with them about economics, which we think is important for the region and important for the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last think I\'ll say is this.\xc2\xa0 The other priority that we\'ve been pressing during the course of this week and leading up to this week has been one around rules and norms.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s been an important conversation to have.\xc2\xa0 And that goes not just in the economic area, but also in a conversation we\'ve been having about the South China Sea and the necessity of having any disputes there really settled peaceably -- peacefully -- and in accord with international norms and rules.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on China -- could you read out the President\'s meeting with the Premier today --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\'d be glad to do that.\xc2\xa0 The meeting that the President had with Premier Wen today was a follow-on to a conversation that they began at dinner last night.\xc2\xa0 And Premier Wen asked for a few more minutes today to continue that conversation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the backdrop to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey had an informal meeting this morning, and the principal focus of the meeting was on economics.\xc2\xa0 And the President went through a number of the points that he had made to President Hu Jintao in Hawaii in the earlier part of the week.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re as I described -- the importance of China\'s currency policy to the world and the appropriate contribution that it needs to make in terms of a fairly valued currency policy; some of the specific issues around business practices -- if you will, currency-plus, in terms of the discussion that they had today.\xc2\xa0 It was a good engagement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, the President set it out as directly as he did with President Hu.\xc2\xa0 It was important, I think, to continue that conversation, because, as you know, Premier Wen is the principal economic manager in China.\xc2\xa0 They briefly talked about the South China Sea and the East Asia Summit at the end of that -- because it was a short meeting.\xc2\xa0 And the President indicated that they would have a further conversation about it in the context of the East Asia Summit leaders\xe2\x80\x99 retreat this afternoon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat, by the way, follows on the discussion that the President had with the ASEAN leaders yesterday about the South China Sea.\xc2\xa0 And a number of those countries yesterday raised that issue.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the U.S. position here is a principled position.\xc2\xa0 The United States is a Pacific power; it\xe2\x80\x99s a trading power; it\xe2\x80\x99s a maritime power.\xc2\xa0 The United States has an interest in the freedom of navigation, the free flow of commerce, the peaceful resolution of disputes.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a claim.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t take sides in the claims.\xc2\xa0 But we do, as a global maritime power, have an interest in seeing these principles applied broadly.\xc2\xa0 But the conversation today, to be just totally straight with you, was a short conversation, principally focused again on economics.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, hi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hang on now, I just lost my question.\xc2\xa0 Here it is.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you a follow-on on China and the South China Sea, and then a military one, if I could.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regard to the South China Sea, what evidence does the U.S. have that China is actually a threat to the freedom of navigation or commercial access?\xc2\xa0 And are there some incidents in the sea that have been increasing?\xc2\xa0 Can you put a measure on it? And I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask for the second after.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be glad to address that.\xc2\xa0 It really isn\xe2\x80\x99t about, from our perspective, about specific instances, although, there have been tensions that have risen.\xc2\xa0 And you see that in the comments and the concerns that are raised by a number of ASEAN countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, again, just to be totally straightforward about this -- the United States interest here is in the freedom of flow in commerce.\xc2\xa0 We have a big interest in it here.\xc2\xa0 We have an interest in these principles around the world.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t have an interest, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a claim.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t -- as I said earlier, we don\xe2\x80\x99t take sides in any of these claims.\xc2\xa0 But we do believe that there should be developed a collaborative diplomatic process for the resolution of these claims.\xc2\xa0 We do believe that they should be resolved peacefully.\xc2\xa0 The United States has an interest in that, obviously.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that they should be resolved in accordance with international norm and international law.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has made this -- this has been the position we have taken on this for a period of time.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a position that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken directly with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a position I said that is rooted in our global application of these principles.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a set of positions that I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually, with the Chinese, said directly, that as they -- that they should be interested in seeing applied globally as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s a -- but again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the questions raised.\xc2\xa0 I think that -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quantify or comment on the specifics of any claim.\xc2\xa0 But you have seen the comments from other countries about concerns that they have.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the United States interest is not in taking side in any specific claim.\xc2\xa0 The United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have an interest in any specific claim.\xc2\xa0 But the United States has an interest in the peaceful settlement of these kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 The United States has an interest in the freedom of navigation, and not being upset by disputes, and certainly not being upset by disputes that aren\xe2\x80\x99t settled peacefully.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the military question I wanted to ask you is a follow-on to the Australia partnership that was announced.\xc2\xa0 Are there any plans to expand that?\xc2\xa0 You know the way the TPP is kind of an aspirational thing for other countries to join -- is there any thought that the U.S. would start rotating assets into maybe Vietnam or some other friendly Asia Pacific partnering nations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 There\'s certainly no decisions made along those lines.\xc2\xa0 But the Australian decision I think is important again to undergird some of the things I said at the outset.\xc2\xa0 It really is deepening that alliance.\xc2\xa0 And what it involves for us\xc2\xa0 -- and obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take place at a very measured pace, as you know, in terms of our participation on the Australian bases and building up to working on joint exercises and engaging in some regional work.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here, though, again, kind of -- I talked at the top about our global rebalancing -- that is turning our attention to Asia and resources to Asia, mindshare, if you will, and policy attention to Asia.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s notable, even from the outside of the administration, by the way -- I should have mentioned this -- that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first trip was to Asia.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the first that a Secretary of State has taken his or her first trip to Asia since Dean Rusk in 1961.\xc2\xa0 And that was, I think, an important signal of where we were going on this.\xc2\xa0 This has been three years of work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to you all about in an hour, implementing here.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut within Asia, Margaret, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing also is looking at where we have our resources.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that we were underweighted, as you went south, given the importance of those sea lanes, given, by the way, the important contribution we make to things like disaster relief.\xc2\xa0 So that is part of kind of an internal rebalancing within Asia that the United States is making in order to be effective, efficient, cost-effective, and able to take on the challenges that we face.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on any further basing announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to discuss things loosely on Canberra here.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a pass on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay, Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- quick ones.\xc2\xa0 One, as important s this trip is, obviously back in Washington you\'re trying to keep an eye on the super committee -- most of the reports are pretty grim, that they\'re not going to get a deal at this point.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there\'s still time.\xc2\xa0 What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s latest on whether they\'re close to a deal or whether they\'re close to triggering the defense cuts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 That\'s substantially outside my lane.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you want to hold that or you want to do it now, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what I can comment on is what we\'re doing within the current context of the Budget Control Act with respect to security, and what the United States\' priorities are.\xc2\xa0 But I really can\'t comment on the -- I don\'t know anything about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just do this real quick.\xc2\xa0 Ed, our position on this is what it has been.\xc2\xa0 We very much hope that the super committee will fulfill its mandate, produce a proposal that is balanced and fair, that doesn\'t ask any sector of society to bear the burden of reducing our deficits and getting our fiscal house in order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, as you know, from the very beginning of this process put forward a very detailed proposal.\xc2\xa0 Somehow, someway, there are some people out there who still claim it doesn\'t exist. I can give you the website if you\'d like, but I know you know it exists.\xc2\xa0 And it is really a road map for the kind of outcome that the President believes -- and not incidentally, the American people believe -- this is the right way to resolve this.\xc2\xa0 So we hope that in the coming days the committee will produce something that meets the principles the President laid out in his proposal.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBack to Tom.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had a chance to ask you about the story on Pakistan, "memogate" -- and I think retired Admiral Mullen has confirmed that he at least received this memo, and it\'s really kind of threatened the whole Pakistani government right now.\xc2\xa0 And I guess two parts:\xc2\xa0 One, what do you think about the state of the Pakistani government right now, whether President Zardari may step down?\xc2\xa0 But also, was anyone at the White House ever involved in these conversations with the Pakistani ambassador who\'s now been recalled?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\'t have a way to comment from this distance.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have a way to comment on that from this distance at this point.\xc2\xa0 We have obviously a critically important relationship with Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 We have a critically important counterterrorism relationship with the Pakistanis that we work on every single day.\xc2\xa0 We have, obviously, the support that we need for our efforts in Afghanistan that we work on each day with the Pakistanis.\xc2\xa0 We work with both the civilian government and with the military, depending on the issue.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a way, from this distance, to comment on the question that you raise.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 This is sort of a two-part question that relates:\xc2\xa0 One is, you\'ve talked about how you\'ve pivoted to Asia on this trip.\xc2\xa0 What do you see as the next steps going forward?\xc2\xa0 When do you anticipate the President returning to the region?\xc2\xa0 And what are the concrete things that you think come next to make this a reality?\xc2\xa0 And I\'ll just ask you a second part, too, because it relates, which is, you\'re pivoting away from the old problems, but the old problems still have a way of raising their hands for attention, such as the situation with Pakistan; obviously the war in Afghanistan is ongoing; the Middle East peace process hasn\'t gone away.\xc2\xa0 I mean, all of these old-school problems are still there.\xc2\xa0 So if you could talk about how you deal with that even as you say you\'re rebalancing, and what specifically is to come.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\'m glad to do that.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the first question, there\'s a tremendous work stream, I think, that comes out of this trip, beginning on the economic side. We\'ll need to continue to work through the arrangements that we put out for implementation at APEC in terms of economic integration.\xc2\xa0 Very importantly, TPP.\xc2\xa0 We announced that we had agreement on a framework, but we set the goal of getting the actual agreement negotiated during 2012.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a very important -- obviously a very important piece of follow-up coming out here.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, it really is a significant event -- the United States participating in an effort here to put together a high-quality open-trade agreement, to which other countries have been attracted.\xc2\xa0 And so there will be several lines of work -- Taking the framework and making that into a real agreement, but also on the consultative side, consulting with the nations who want to join the TPP going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith respect to alliances, we have a tremendous amount of work that we\'re doing all the time with our allies in the region. I can\'t announce at this point when the President\'s next trip back is to Asia.\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to go back and look at the calendar and look at the dates that are assigned to various events.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second question was with the respect to the other challenges that we have.\xc2\xa0 This doesn\'t mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t, obviously, have intensive engagement on the other challenges.\xc2\xa0 Now, we have engaged in a number of strategies here that have allowed, I think, in terms of policy attention, resources for us to turn to a number of these other challenges.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have drawn down our troops in Iraq, and by December 31st, 2011, we\'ll complete that drawdown.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged in a very -- a much tighter and quite aggressive effort with respect to counterterrorism.\xc2\xa0 We are on track to complete our drawdown of the surge forces in Afghanistan by September of next year.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have 10,000 that had drawn down during the course of 2011, and then another 23,000 that we\'ll draw down by the end of the summer -- next year sometime -- in September, and headed towards a more sustainable long-term relationship there.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this doesn\'t -- this is really a statement here about having been underweighted and bringing new energy, resources and attention here.\xc2\xa0 It obviously doesn\'t mean that we don\'t have a range of other issues that we\'re dealing with every day.\xc2\xa0 Although, as the President said, as the tide of the wars recede, we will shift our attention to those challenges that we think are critical for the coming century.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re in the process of doing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think we\'ve been pretty successful at it, frankly.\xc2\xa0 It takes a -- it does take, obviously, the President setting out the strategy and then our implementing it.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\'ve been pretty successful of accomplishing the goals that we set out for ourselves, and enabling us to engage, as I said, here with respect to Asia in an "all in" way on those priorities that we think needed more attention and are important for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tChuck.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the IAEA Board of Governors\' statement mean China and Russia actually believe the IAEA report now?\xc2\xa0 Do you believe they believe it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\'t speak for the Chinese and Russian governments.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you what the facts are.\xc2\xa0 The facts are, in the last two days that two events have taken place which I think are notable.\xc2\xa0 The first is, with respect to the IAEA report, which after tremendous amount of work by the professional technical staff at the IAEA, found that in fact up to 2003 the Iranians were pursuing nuclear aspects of their nuclear efforts -- weapon aspects of their nuclear efforts and that some of those elements continued after 2003.\xc2\xa0 It was a thorough, professional and impartial report.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd yesterday, as you know, 32 countries voted a resolution asking the Iranians to meet their obligations.\xc2\xa0 These votes took place after the President had talked directly, as you know, to President Medvedev and to President Hu.\xc2\xa0 Russia, China and the United States, I can tell you, share a similar goal, and that is not seeing the Iranians move towards the development of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we share the goal of having the IAEA be an effective organization.\xc2\xa0 With respect to every paragraph in the report, you\'d have to talk to the Russians and the Chinese about that.\xc2\xa0 But the vote yesterday was 32 yes, 2 no\'s -- Cuba and Ecuador.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that happened yesterday was this -- is that there was a United Nations General Assembly resolution put forth, principally sponsored by the Saudis but joined in, I think, by about 40 other countries, Ben, if I\'m not mistaken, and passed yesterday deploring the assassination plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 That vote yesterday was 106 to nine, and notably -- and this, I think, is critical -- there wasn\'t one Arab or Muslim country that voted with the Iranians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt indicates, I think, the isolation that Iran is undergoing right now with respect to the choices they\xe2\x80\x99ve made on the nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And the degree of isolation really is unprecedented, Chuck, when you think about it.\xc2\xa0 Again, 32 to 2 at the IAEA -- that\'s a stronger vote than in the last IAEA resolution -- and 106 to 9, without a single Arab or Muslim country voting against it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd of course, the principle at stake at the U.N. was really important, and that is the safety and security of diplomats around the world, and countries meeting what is an absolutely fundamental diplomatic obligation -- and that is to respect the privileges and immunities and safety of the diplomats around the world from civilized countries.\xc2\xa0 This is a -- so it\'s a notable set of events.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you speak to the fact that the Russians and the Chinese in the bilats that you participated in, in Hawaii seem to not have the same sense of urgency that they had two years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been united on this effort for three years now.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re always going to have conversations about tactics, Chuck, with respect to how to how they go about this.\xc2\xa0 But I think we share this --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- not disagreements over the report itself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you\'d have to ask -- I\'m not going to speak for the Chinese and the Russians with respect to every paragraph in the report.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the Russians and the Chinese, along with 30 other countries yesterday, at the IAEA voted for a resolution calling on Iran to meet its obligations, and commending the Secretary to the IAEA for the report.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Tom, I\'d just add one thing --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, you were asking me about this the other day and I\'d just remind you that one of the points that the President made in both of those bilateral meetings was the importance to demonstrate international unity in support of Iran meeting its obligations in the context of the IAEA report.\xc2\xa0 And the President specifically raised in both meetings the Board of Governors meeting as an important opportunity for the P5-plus-1 to continue to show that unity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo both meetings with the Russians and the Chinese, the President specifically raised the importance of this upcoming vote and the need to show that unity, and there was good follow-through on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I think -- and that\'s a very important point, Ben.\xc2\xa0 And that unity is absolutely important.\xc2\xa0 There is, among almost the entire world, a unified view that Iran should not go down the path towards developing nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we have had, from the outset of this administration, through a lot of work -- working with great powers and others around the world -- a high degree of unity on this.\xc2\xa0 And I think as the Iranians look out this morning, Chuck, they see themselves really wholly isolated here.\xc2\xa0 Again, 32 to 2, with the Cubans and the Ecuadorians, and then the United Nations deploring an assassination plot -- 106 to 9.\xc2\xa0 Those are significant events with respect to Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look, by the way, at Iran\'s place in the wake of the Arab Spring and the cost that they\'ve paid for the choices and decisions their leaders have made here, not being able to assure the world that they\'re engaged in peaceful nuclear activities, it\'s been substantial -- with respect to their economy, with respect to their political isolation.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s a longer discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tom\'s got time for two more.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Okay, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has sort of publicly given the Chinese quite a lot to think about on this trip.\xc2\xa0 How would you expect them to respond in the long term?\xc2\xa0 And do you think any of the sharpened U.S. tone in this rebalancing of forces could sort of have an effect on domestic Chinese politics?\xc2\xa0 Could, like, sources in the PLA say to the leadership, "see, we told you all along -- the U.S. is trying to isolate us and contain us"?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Of course, the -- but let\'s go through what the President said this week as well.\xc2\xa0 This has nothing to do with isolating or containing anybody.\xc2\xa0 The President has publicly welcomed, as a matter of United States policy, China\'s peaceful rise and success.\xc2\xa0 That\'s in the United States\' interest.\xc2\xa0 The President has said in his Canberra speech, and I said again here today, that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 goal in the region is to have a stable, peaceful, economically prosperous region, and that\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of everyone in the region, including the Chinese.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have been very direct with the Chinese about our plans here.\xc2\xa0 And, again, if you look at the public statements of the Chinese, they have welcomes the United States presence in the region.\xc2\xa0 I do think one of the things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on here is important to note, which is we have been working on trying to deepen military-to-military conversations so that we can even have more transparency on both sides with respect to military plans and intentions.</p>\n<p>\n\tThird, I think that you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in China a debate that\xe2\x80\x99s been quite public over the last year or so, about the extent to which China should pursue a more aggressive foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 I think the current leadership has really come down squarely in the camp of not pursuing, with respect to the United States, a confrontational policy because it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in the interest of China.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you look at the peaceful rise paper that was put out I think this past September -- if you look at Dai Bingguo\xe2\x80\x99s paper that was published a year ago, December, and public statements, you can see there is a debate, as you point out.\xc2\xa0 But this leadership team I think sees it in the interest of China to continue to engage in a cooperative and positive and constructive relationship with the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 From much of the 2000s, the focus of U.S. foreign policy seemed to be the terrorist threat -- of terrorists.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard very much about terrorism on this trip.\xc2\xa0 Bali has been the scene of some terrible terrorist attacks.\xc2\xa0 Have we more or less achieved many of our goals in combating terrorism to a point where we can now sort of pivot to and focus -- refocus our attention on other things, like the importance of Asia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a broad question and let me address it. We work on addressing the terrorist threat every single day.\xc2\xa0 And we have made progress.\xc2\xa0 Indeed, we believe, as of the end of 2010 -- and we said this publicly, I think, Ben -- that in fact\xc2\xa0 al Qaeda was in the worse shape it had been in since 2001.\xc2\xa0 We obviously dealt a strategic blow to al Qaeda with the operation against Osama bin Laden in May of this year.\xc2\xa0 And we have had an aggressive continuation of pressure on al Qaeda and associated entities that threaten the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe work on this every single day in a targeted way.\xc2\xa0 One of the most important things I think that President Obama has done is to be very clear about what the threat is, what the target is. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s enabled the United States to address it very effectively.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIs a terrorist threat defeated?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Have we made a lot of progress?\xc2\xa0 I think we have, frankly, in the last three years.\xc2\xa0 But it is a priority every single day of the week for all of us in the national security team and for the President, absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask just one follow on Iran?\xc2\xa0 Because there is a report out saying that the U.S. plans to sanction Iran\xe2\x80\x99s petrochemical industry.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t confirm that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. DONILON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all.\xc2\xa0 I really appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As Tom is walking, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one on the super committee.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the super committee, has the President been doing any calls lately?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have -- the President has obviously been engaged in numerous bilateral meetings and group meetings here.\xc2\xa0 He has not made any other calls to leaders of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But he is obviously in regular contact with his staff in Washington, including those who are monitoring the super committee\xe2\x80\x99s progress and engaging with Congress on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, all.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:55 P.M.
