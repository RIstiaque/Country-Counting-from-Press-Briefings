EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started here, I wanted to introduce Brett McGurk.\xc2\xa0 He is the President\xe2\x80\x99s Special Envoy to our Global Counter-ISIL Coalition.\xc2\xa0 And he has prepared some materials to discuss with you today some of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on the ground against ISIL in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And then he\xe2\x80\x99s got a little time afterwards to take a handful of questions from all of you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that before we go back to our regularly scheduled programming.\xc2\xa0 So, Brett, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 So I thought what we\xe2\x80\x99d do -- I\xe2\x80\x99d take about 10 minutes to put you into the picture of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing day to day in this very difficult, extraordinarily complex fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t overstate the complexity of this, and yet despite that, we now have some real traction against this very serious enemy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We define ISIL -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a global organization; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve built a global coalition of 66 partners to combat it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really defined as the core in Iraq and Syria, the phony, self-proclaimed caliphate.\xc2\xa0 There are then networks -- global networks, propaganda networks, foreign-fighter networks, financing networks -- so we\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of gotten a handle on those. And then affiliates, about eight of them around the world.\xc2\xa0 Of course, Libya is one we\xe2\x80\x99re particularly concerned about, and we took some action there this week.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I wanted to focus on today, just about 10 minutes as an opening, is the core in Iraq and Syria, because there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great deal of focus on there.\xc2\xa0 And, as the President has said, we have to defeat them in the core and show that this is not an expanding movement; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a shrinking movement.\xc2\xa0 And so to defeat them in the core is how you actually begin to unravel the entire global network, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to see that now in some concrete ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a map here, which I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go around very briefly, kind of clockwise, to describe what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and just how complex this is, and what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The number one, that is what we call the Manbij pocket.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a 98-kilometer strip of border with Turkey.\xc2\xa0 It is the last remaining outlet of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s territory with the outside world.\xc2\xa0 Turkey has done a very good job of beginning to close down that border, and the President spoke with President Erdogan earlier this week, and that was of course one of the topics of conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to situate this map real quick -- orange is areas that ISIL controls.\xc2\xa0 Green are areas that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost over the last 18 months, so you can see the constriction of the areas they used to control.\xc2\xa0 And red are areas in which they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually made some gains.\xc2\xa0 So just to the west of this number one is where they\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to push out, and we call that the Mar\xe2\x80\x99a line.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to push out there for about a year.\xc2\xa0 We think we\xe2\x80\x99ve halted that flow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Russian air campaign in this part of the country has dramatically complicated the picture.\xc2\xa0 The Russians, in working with the regime, have cut off the main supply corridor coming from Turkey into Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 The Russians say that\xe2\x80\x99s to cut off the weapons corridor; it\xe2\x80\x99s actually primarily a humanitarian corridor.\xc2\xa0 And this has really created a real humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also completely shaken up the situation north of there to the Turkish border.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most complex areas of the map, which I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to talk about in more detail.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Number two is Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 Raqqa, of course, is their main headquarters.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s where we think most of the leaders are.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s where plots like Paris are planned and coordinated.\xc2\xa0 And so, therefore, we are focused on eliminating the enemy in Raqqa every single day.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing airstrikes there constantly, but most importantly, not just the military part, we\xe2\x80\x99re fusing information from across the government and, most importantly, from across the coalition about what we know about this enemy -- about how it finances itself, how it communicates, how it funds itself.\xc2\xa0 We know more now than we ever did before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to constrict its hold on Raqqa.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This dam just to the northwest, Tishreen Dam, that was the main roadway from Manbij to Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now sliced off.\xc2\xa0 ISIL can no longer access that.\xc2\xa0 And that was an operation by Syrian Kurds and Arabs about a month ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, if I move to number three -- number three right now is the town of al-Shaddadi.\xc2\xa0 Shaddadi, an operation, started about three or four days ago, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very complex operation and it includes thousands of fighters -- I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the specific numbers -- but about 40 percent of them are non-Kurds, 60 percent are Kurd.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When I was in Kobani a couple weeks ago, the main focus was in getting all these disparate groups together and putting them together to kind of consolidate with some coherence and mass to move on ISIL, particularly in Shaddadi.\xc2\xa0 And if you think about it, the kind of metaphor we use, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of different groups that are kinds of shards of wood that want to fight ISIL; it\xe2\x80\x99s our job to try to pull them together not just in bundle but in a bat.\xc2\xa0 And what you have going now towards Shaddadi is a baseball bat.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds, it\xe2\x80\x99s Arabs, it\xe2\x80\x99s Christians -- a number of forces with good command and control, good coordination with our air power, and they\xe2\x80\x99re having some real effect.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is -- again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a military side, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m primarily focused on also is there\xe2\x80\x99s a politics to this -- who\xe2\x80\x99s going to govern a town like Shaddadi afterwards.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s primarily an Arab town, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working very closely to make sure that locals are in control of that town once it\xe2\x80\x99s cleared of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So that is still ongoing.\xc2\xa0 It will unfold over the coming days.\xc2\xa0 So far, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s going fairly well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Number four is Sinjar.\xc2\xa0 Sinjar was the main connector between Raqqa and Mosul.\xc2\xa0 And Shaddadi is the last piece of cutting off this connection between Raqqa and Mosul and making sure that they simply cannot travel those roads anymore.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s been Sinjar, Shaddadi, cutting off the connection between Raqqa and Mosul.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSinjar was for primarily Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.\xc2\xa0 Sinjar is where ISIL really broke onto the international scene with everything we know about the Yazidis and the Yazidi slaves.\xc2\xa0 In fact, they used to take their -- they would take these young women off Sinjar Mountain, collect them, separate them, and then bring them to Shaddadi to kind of trade them as slaves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here is not only a military operation, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a moral imperative to take these areas from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason we\xe2\x80\x99re so focused on it.\xc2\xa0 But Sinjar was very important because it cut off the main highway into Mosul.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to Mosul.\xc2\xa0 Mosul, of course, everybody asks about -- when are we going to move on Mosul?\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question because we won\xe2\x80\x99t put a timeline on it.\xc2\xa0 But Mosul is already started.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re already working to constrict it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pooling all of our information, intelligence, to basically learn more about them.\xc2\xa0 Doing airstrikes into Mosul every single night based on that -- upon that intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And again, most importantly, working the local politics.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m in constant touch with our ambassador on the ground in Baghdad, with our diplomats in the field up in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 And then, again, taking these kind of shards of wood together and turning them into a baseball bat.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done for Mosul -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll see Makhmur on the map -- that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99re setting up a joint -- a headquarters, pooling all of these fighters that are going to fight ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Sunni tribes, it\xe2\x80\x99s local notables from Ninawa province, it\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi Peshmerga, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the Iraqi army.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in Munich last week, for example, I saw both President Barzani of the Kurdistan region and Prime Minister Abadi to sit together to talk about how are we going to deal with Mosul not only militarily, but also politically.\xc2\xa0 That is something we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on, and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually coming along fairly well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll skip to seven, because seven is Tikrit.\xc2\xa0 Tikrit, an iconic city in the heart of Salah ad-Din province, it\xe2\x80\x99s where ISIL moved into in the summer of 2014 and totally depopulated the city -- killed thousands of people in massacres they put on YouTube.\xc2\xa0 It was retaken last year.\xc2\xa0 And then we focused very hard, after the military operations, on what we call stabilization.\xc2\xa0 And that means returning internally displaced people, getting them back to their homes, getting the lights back on.\xc2\xa0 Extremely, extremely difficult to do, especially when we don\xe2\x80\x99t have large numbers of forces on the ground to do this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re working through the U.N. and through our local partners.\xc2\xa0 But Tikrit has been a real success.\xc2\xa0 About 90 to 99 percent of the people are now back in their homes.\xc2\xa0 And one reason of that is very good cooperation from the Iraqi government and Prime Minister Abadi, and he\xe2\x80\x99s delegating a lot of authority to the locals in these areas, so the governor of Salah ad-Din province and to local Sunni leaders in these areas that kind of take charge.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then through the Global Coalition, we have a stabilization fund -- about $80 million now -- to fund these very quick-hit rapid projects.\xc2\xa0 So Tikrit was a proof of concept.\xc2\xa0 It actually worked pretty well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd now we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to do the same thing in Ramadi, which is number eight on the map.\xc2\xa0 Security operations in Ramadi finished about a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 There are still some things ongoing.\xc2\xa0 But now we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on the stabilization piece, trying to get people back into their homes, and most importantly, trying to get de-mining, and IEDs out of the streets and out of the homes.\xc2\xa0 The governor of Anbar province -- I was in Baghdad about 10 weeks ago -- I talked to the governor who was just in Ramadi; every second or third home is wired with IEDs and land mines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo to get people back, we have to get the de-mining teams in.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi de-mining teams but also international de-mining teams.\xc2\xa0 The foreign minister of Norway will be here later this week.\xc2\xa0 Norway has taken a global leadership role in this type of issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to them about that.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s setting up the conditions for Ramadi to get the stabilization moving.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, again, already started.\xc2\xa0 We have -- about 36 electricity generators have come in; about 115 more will be coming in in phase two.\xc2\xa0 Very, very hard.\xc2\xa0 Very painstaking.\xc2\xa0 Very tedious.\xc2\xa0 It requires the government of Baghdad to delegate authority to local leaders in Anbar province.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re working with them on every single day.\xc2\xa0 So the Ramadi stabilization piece about what comes after ISIL is a real focus of ours.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNumber nine, in Haditha -- I point out Haditha because there\xe2\x80\x99s Al Asad Air Base there.\xc2\xa0 And early on in this campaign, President Obama made the decision to put our forces and our Special Forces out at Al Asad Air Base.\xc2\xa0 We were joined by some of our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 And it was really -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out there a few times -- it is Wild West territory.\xc2\xa0 It was very difficult.\xc2\xa0 Had we not gotten out there when we did, this entire area would have been controlled by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But we started working with about two or three tribes, reconnecting with relationships we had previously.\xc2\xa0 Those tribes are now fully mobilized.\xc2\xa0 We have about 10,000 tribal fighters now in Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not only defending against ISIL, they\xe2\x80\x99re now moving and operating on offensive operations, and doing a great job.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s because of our great operators who are out there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Number ten is Rutbah.\xc2\xa0 Rutbah is the highway from Amman to Baghdad.\xc2\xa0 We had a team last week in Amman.\xc2\xa0 King Abdullah is, of course, here this week.\xc2\xa0 We saw the King last week in Amman with his entire interagency team -- his chief of defense, his intelligence chief, his foreign minister -- to talk about western Anbar province and Jordan, and the role that Jordan can play, and the importance of opening up this economic lifeline.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99re also going to be looking to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just not defeating ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what comes after, and opening up the economic interconnections between these places that ISIL has severed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just focus last on eleven -- that\xe2\x80\x99s Palmyra.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important because it\xe2\x80\x99s the dark red.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for ISIL now to take territory.\xc2\xa0 The last major offensive operation it really had was in May of last year, when it retook Ramadi.\xc2\xa0 Little things here and there. \xc2\xa0But Palmyra is -- as we push ISIL from the north, they try to fill space to the south and southwest, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also something we\xe2\x80\x99re focused very much with our Jordanian partners on.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s one reason King Abdullah will be here this week, and we look forward to seeing him.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll, of course, see the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So all of this, it\xe2\x80\x99s military, it\xe2\x80\x99s economic, it\xe2\x80\x99s diplomatic, it\xe2\x80\x99s political.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s extraordinarily complex.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made a great deal of progress, particularly over the last six months after we put a lot of the pieces together.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see over the coming weeks and months more of that kind of coming into shape.\xc2\xa0 Shaddadi is something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening this week, but there will be more things like it over the coming week, which I won\xe2\x80\x99t really preview.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, of course, to pull this all together, we\xe2\x80\x99re in constant communication with our national security team and the President.\xc2\xa0 And the President will be coming to the State Department on Thursday -- as he\xe2\x80\x99s come to the Pentagon in the past; and we, of course, have meetings here in the Situation Room constantly -- but to talk about the political and diplomatic piece of this, which is critical to the long-term success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is the core -- shrinking the core in Iraq and Syria, which is fundamental to our overall strategy, and at the same time drawing up the global networks, and of course focusing on the affiliates.\xc2\xa0 One thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about the global networks -- my final point -- is finances, because I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed by my colleague, Adam, and others about the finances.\xc2\xa0 It took a long time to figure out how is this organization financing itself, what are its weaknesses, and how can we go after it.\xc2\xa0 That was a very intensive intelligence-driven exercise on our part and with the coalition.\xc2\xa0 We learned an awful lot.\xc2\xa0 And then we began to systematically, working with our DOD colleagues, rooting out their economic infrastructure.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that ISIL is now cutting its salary to its fighters by about 50 percent, and I think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see that continue to decrease.\xc2\xa0 Their ability to fund themselves has taken a substantial hit, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make sure that it continues on that trajectory.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very short overview of an extraordinarily complex situation.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 What can we say about the current numbers of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria?\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hearing a lot about Saudi Arabia making these offers to possibly use ground troops or do something more.\xc2\xa0 What can you say about that, as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So, foreign fighters is a great question because the foreign fighter question kind of exemplifies why this is something -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen something like this before.\xc2\xa0 So total foreign fighters we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- about 35,000 from 120 countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Traveling?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 No, total number that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten that down now to about -- I think the high-end estimate now is about 25,000.\xc2\xa0 But if you put that in perspective -- and it depends on who you talk to, who were following this in the Afghanistan days in the \xe2\x80\x9880s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s about twice as many of jihadist foreign fighters that went into a theater, and that was only a handful of countries.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why this is such a global threat like something we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what are we trying to do?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not only working with our partners in Turkey to close the border and to do a good job in terms of who comes through Turkey, and the Turks have actually done a very good job at that recently.\xc2\xa0 But also the source countries -- they\xe2\x80\x99re coming from 120 countries all around the world, and we need those countries to share information with Turkey, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also improved that quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s still an extraordinary challenge.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that foreign fighters cannot get into Syria, and once they get into Syria, they\xe2\x80\x99ll never get out.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some of them now try to go to Libya.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to come into Syria, and those that get into Syria are finding a pretty miserable go of it and we want to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia is also a key partner in the coalition, a real leader in terms of the counter-messaging, particularly religiously based messaging that we obviously cannot take the lead on.\xc2\xa0 And so we very much encourage that.\xc2\xa0 And when they come to us with some ideas, we\xe2\x80\x99re very much open to those ideas because we want them to be a part of this campaign within the umbrella of our broader coalition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned shrinking the core.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the capability that ISIS had to plot or orchestrate the attack in Paris, what evidence is there that you have degraded that capability?\xc2\xa0 Is there any?\xc2\xa0 And do you think you have, or do you not know whether they have the same capability that they had a few months ago when they orchestrated that attack?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a great question.\xc2\xa0 They have a sophisticated external plotting network.\xc2\xa0 We know more about it now than we did before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to learn more about it.\xc2\xa0 And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve done with similar networks, we will learn about it and then we will completely uproot it and eradicate it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What makes ISIL a little bit different is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a state-like entity.\xc2\xa0 It tries to pretend that it\xe2\x80\x99s a state, it controls territory, it controls territory with millions of people.\xc2\xa0 It plans operations in Raqqa, it then sends its operatives, we believe, from Raqqa up through that Manbij pocket, and they\xe2\x80\x99re able to sneak out.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s harder for them to get out now.\xc2\xa0 So we really want to do two things:\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that border is sealed, and we want to take the territory away so they can\xe2\x80\x99t move.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the map shows, as I mentioned, the Tishreen Dam, from Raqqa to Manbij is kind of how they used to go and then get out.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we had to take away that Tishreen Dam.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s basically a bridge that crosses the Euphrates.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s much harder for them to move now, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue doing that.\xc2\xa0 And as we know who is part of that network, we\xe2\x80\x99ll of course target them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something our DOD colleagues are focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is that capability dependent on them physically moving out of Raqqa?\xc2\xa0 Are there communications abilities that they have that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able trace?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned money, cutting salaries or pay of some fighters.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for to see what evidence there is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So they try to do two things.\xc2\xa0 They try to inspire lone-wolf attacks, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely with the private sector, with Twitter, with Facebook, everything to eliminate their ability to do that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some other things to eliminate their ability to do that.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of lone-wolf one-off attacks they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to inspire.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut they also are planning -- trying to plan bigger things.\xc2\xa0 So Paris, for example, was we believe planned in Raqqa, planned by some of their foreign fighter external operatives.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we find these people, and we do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re able to kill them.\xc2\xa0 So, Jihadi John.\xc2\xa0 Jihadi John was one of the main guys on the Internet trying to inspire lone-wolf attacks.\xc2\xa0 That was his main reason for being a part of the organization of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Not only did we shut down his network, we were able to find him and kill him.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering what you -- in your diplomatic engagement, what you say to Syrian rebels who think that perhaps the United States hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a reliable ally to them.\xc2\xa0 In recent months, people have been pummeled in Aleppo, and the U.S. hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to step in and save them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re doing an awful lot.\xc2\xa0 But one thing we\xe2\x80\x99re doing right now is working very hard at the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And nobody is under any illusions for how difficult this will be.\xc2\xa0 And my colleague, Michael Ratney, is talking to all the groups now.\xc2\xa0 And we are working particularly in this area north of Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 Because the area north of Aleppo is not Nusra, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ISIL, it\xe2\x80\x99s moderate opposition groups.\xc2\xa0 So if the cessation of hostilities is to take root and hold, we should see a serious de-escalation of violence there.\xc2\xa0 And so the conflict in Syria between the regime and the opposition -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of discussions with our partners on this and with, of course, with the Russians and everyone else through this Vienna format.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s the type of conflict that can go on and on forever.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at the numbers, just open-source numbers from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and other sources, about 100,000 combatants, give or take, have been killed.\xc2\xa0 More fighters on the regime side have been killed than the opposition side.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is something that can just go on and on forever.\xc2\xa0 And if the Russians don\'t make some changes in their behavior, and the regime doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make some changes in their behavior, and we can\'t have a serious political process for a transition -- which is now locked into U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 -- this will go on forever.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we\'re trying to do is to deescalate the conflict and to lock into place a cessation of hostilities, which will begin to change the dynamic -- to get humanitarian supplies into these besieged areas.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen some progress in that.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s one reason we\'re working so hard at that right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll know more next week about how this is going.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of people working very hard at it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this ceasefire or cessation of hostilities doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold, is the U.S. credibility among those rebel groups further damaged?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I think Secretary Kerry spoke to that before the Congress today.\xc2\xa0 We\'re, of course, preparing for all contingencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You saw some car bombs in Damascus this week.\xc2\xa0 Is it the U.S. assessment that ISIS has been able to infiltrate what has been an Assad stronghold?\xc2\xa0 And if you could also talk -- what you\'re seeing in Libya.\xc2\xa0 How is the growth of foreign fighters there and the kind of structure they\xe2\x80\x99re building different than what is happening in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 So ISIL took credit for those car bombings.\xc2\xa0 It\'s signature ISIL-type attacks, and we have no reason to doubt it was ISIL.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done a number of attacks in Damascus before.\xc2\xa0 ISIL is really a threat to everybody.\xc2\xa0 And one thing all of our partners in the region -- we try to make this point all the time -- that there\xe2\x80\x99s different threat perceptions in every capital around the region, but ISIL is a threat to absolutely everybody.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re a threat, frankly, to the people in Damascus.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we want to unite ranks as much as possible against ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Libya is just a bit of a different situation.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have the sectarian dynamic; you don\'t have a lot of the dynamics we have in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 But we do see ISIL using the same tactics that it used in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So it establishes itself.\xc2\xa0 It eliminates all competitors and it tries to attract, through the migrant flow in Africa, it tries to attract foreign fighters into Libya.\xc2\xa0 Its own open-source propaganda in Dabiq Magazine is now telling people, hey, don\'t go into the caliphate in Syria, come to Libya.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s trying to attract as many foreign fighters to Libya as possible.\xc2\xa0 And where it has roots, such as Sirte, it eliminates all of its competitors.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s trying to project attacks outwards, as we\'ve seen in Tunisia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, it\'s a serious threat and it\'s something that, obviously, we\'re focusing on every day.\xc2\xa0 But the sequence of events in Libya that we want to see is to have the Libyan political process completed, and we\'re hoping to have a vote in the Libyan parliament to approve the new Government of National Accord, from which we can, as a whole international community -- which is locked into a U.N. Security Council resolution -- support that government and help them get on its feet.\xc2\xa0 But when we see a threat emerging in Libya, we won\'t hesitate to act in the meantime.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify, given the proximity of Libya to Europe, is there more of a focus not only on these affiliates but on having those affiliates act externally -- more external attacks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Yes, a lot of focus is on Libya.\xc2\xa0 So when we had -- the coalition got together in Rome a couple weeks ago with Secretary Kerry, and a main topic of conversation was Libya.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now flying -- I think the Italians announced yesterday -- flying our ISR out of Italy.\xc2\xa0 So Libya is a huge focus, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve already launched external attacks from Libya.\xc2\xa0 But one reason we launched the attack the other day on a leading terrorist who was responsible for the attacks in Tunisia and on a ISIL training camp was because, when we see an ISIL training camp and we see them doing pushups and calisthenics there every day, they\xe2\x80\x99re not there to lose weight.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99re there to train for something, and we\'re not going to let them do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nadia.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m actually surprised that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk in detail about the efforts to fight ISIS in Syria, considering that you talked about the coalition, the Russians claiming that they are fighting there, the Syrian regime, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So considering that ISIS is not part of this cessation of hostility agreement that was signed yesterday, can you just put this in a picture, where are we now in terms of ISIS and its gaining territories or not in Syria?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, one part in this communiqu\xc3\xa9 that I\'m sure you saw yesterday -- that is says that the commission will identify both the areas under ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra.\xc2\xa0 And you know very well, probably more than most people, that Jabhat al-Nusra was under Jaysh al-Fatah.\xc2\xa0 So how difficult is it for all parties, actually, including the Russians, to target this Syrian opposition, the moderate one, if there\xe2\x80\x99s -- Jaysh al-Fatah and they are very close to Jabhat al-Nusra?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 It\'s an excellent question.\xc2\xa0 And ISIL -- we have not seen them launch major operations in Syria for some time.\xc2\xa0 It\'s doing some things right now -- actually northeast of Aleppo, trying to take away some territory from the regime.\xc2\xa0 That sort of stuff goes on day to day.\xc2\xa0 But delineating where ISIL is, is fairly easy; delineating where Nusra is in some parts of the country is also fairly easy.\xc2\xa0 But we also have these difficult parts of the country where things are marbled together.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you read the statement carefully, we\'ve agreed to try to delineate as best we can, but also the groups that sign up to the cessation of hostilities will not be attacked by the Russians and the regime.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very clear.\xc2\xa0 So if groups are signing up to the cessation of hostilities and those attacks continue, that will be a clear violation of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s very clearly stated and signed on to by the Russians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have to see how it is implemented, but this will all be -- the proof of the pudding is in the eating in these things. So we\'ll know once we get into the implementation phase.\xc2\xa0 And if the Russians and the regime are continuing to attack opposition groups that are part of the cessation of hostilities, they will be in total violation of the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll know more as we get into next week.\xc2\xa0 But you hit the nail on the head of a very difficult question, which we need to delineate as best we can.\xc2\xa0 But we have an agreement from the Russians and, again, we have to see.\xc2\xa0 But opposition groups that agree to the cessation of hostilities will not be attacked.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And nobody is under any illusions of how difficult this will be, nor are we under any illusions that we can take their word as it stands.\xc2\xa0 We have to see.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the test will be in the implementation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You touched on this a bit, but can you kind of talk specifically about what comes next in Libya?\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the recent airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 Is this going to be an incremental approach where you expect to carry out more airstrikes as the political process plays out?\xc2\xa0 And you said that this is a big focus in Europe.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect a lot of cooperation from the European partners on this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I would expect an awful lot of cooperation --Italy, France, a lot of those countries, particularly in Rome, are talking about taking a leading role, but mainly a leading role in supporting a new Government of National Accord.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s been a great effort and emphasis in getting that government formation process finalized.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, at the same time, though, we\'re not just letting these threats fester, as you saw earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 But we want to see that government formed just as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 It\'s very important.\xc2\xa0 My colleague, Jonathan Winer, our Envoy in Libya, is working this day and night with Martin Kobler, the U.N. Special Envoy.\xc2\xa0 So we want to see that government formed.\xc2\xa0 And once that government is formed, I think the international community and our partners in Europe will swing behind it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, when we see threats emerging such as ISIL, and threats emerging that threaten us or our partners in a very direct way, we won\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brett, would you agree that the current counter-ISIL strategy is effective?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I think if you look back to where we were only 18 months ago -- and I was in Iraq when Mosul fell; I was in Baghdad when we were having very serious conversations about the total collapse of Baghdad, about the fall of the Baghdad airport, about the fact that you had this entire fraying of an entire society; seven Iraqi army divisions simply totally collapsed -- if you go from that point to where we are now, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take it from Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Working as a coalition to rebuild an Iraqi security force that had been totally demoralized and almost on its back to getting them back up, to getting them trained, to bringing them back into some coherence -- that baseball bat analogy I used before -- and then to retake a city like Ramadi, one of the most difficult terrains in an urban environment to fight in -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made quite a bit of progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my first point here was how difficult this was going to be.\xc2\xa0 We always said it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a long time.\xc2\xa0 But if you go from where we were in the summer of 2014, and recognizing how difficult this is, and you just look at the map of taking away 40 percent of their territory in Iraq -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to shrink -- we\xe2\x80\x99re having some good effect.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re taking out about one to two of their main, key leaders every few days, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing some things that obviously I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about from the podium, but some momentum is beginning to build.\xc2\xa0 They would flow freely from Raqqa to Mosul.\xc2\xa0 They had the highway. And now they can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That road is entirely cut off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to squeeze them, restrict them in Mosul, continue to squeeze and constrict them in Raqqa, and also continue to galvanize the entire international community against this threat, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a global challenge.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s also something that we began beginning in the summer of 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it has been effective, but nobody working with us every day is under any illusions of how difficult this is, of how sophisticated this organization is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, its external plotting network is not just a bunch of leaders who are plotting; it\xe2\x80\x99s organic.\xc2\xa0 They try to do lone-wolf attacks -- inspire lone-wolf attacks while they plan and try to do more sophisticated things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we try to stay ahead of every day.\xc2\xa0 We, within our government, led by the President and the national security team, we try to have a pretty flat organization, working with fusing information from the Treasury Department, Defense Department, State Department, to stay ahead of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s actually -- we\xe2\x80\x99re doing a better job at that now than we were about a year ago.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep at it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I think the momentum has turned.\xc2\xa0 The foreign fighter numbers have begun to go down.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to keep at it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about Turkey.\xc2\xa0 Can you sort of talk a little bit about their role in all of this?\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be too happy when you met with YPG in Kobani, and they have basically said the U.S. should either for us or against us.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that and sort of talk about how Turkey will play a role in the cessation of hostilities, but also making sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re not taking out the Kurdish fighters that we\xe2\x80\x99re partnered with?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been to Turkey more than any country in the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re a critical partner of ours.\xc2\xa0 I was last there with Vice President Biden.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with them extraordinarily closely.\xc2\xa0 And, as I said when President Obama saw President Erdogan in Antalya for the G20, one of the main focuses of conversation was this 98-kilometer strip of border.\xc2\xa0 We had some recommendations for the Turks; they had some recommendations for us.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked very closely together, and have made a real difference on that border.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that very close partnership.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My trip to Kobani was primarily focused on, as I mentioned, getting the political cohesiveness -- not just Kurds but Arabs, Christians, other units -- getting them together, a political cohesiveness, to begin to move on Shaddadi.\xc2\xa0 And that was the main purpose of the trip.\xc2\xa0 And now, I think, the fact that the Shaddadi operation is underway, I think we feel pretty good about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work closely with Turkey day to day.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re one of the primary partners for us in this campaign.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President spoke with President Erdogan for almost an hour and a half the other day.\xc2\xa0 And we have to work on this closely together.\xc2\xa0 So we can\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in this without Turkey.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll do Jon and then Tara.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, just a quick follow-up on the overall strategy and how effective.\xc2\xa0 In your answer on the last 18 months, you talk about the territory that\xe2\x80\x99s been taken back in Syria and in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 If you look at ISIL as an overall organization, and you factor in what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to gain in Libya and the foreign fighters that have now started to go to Libya, and you see what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in terms of recruitment and inspiring followers globally, would you say that this organization is stronger or weaker now than it was 18 months ago?\xc2\xa0 Not just the core here, but the overall.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 I think overall it\xe2\x80\x99s weaker.\xc2\xa0 Look, a couple things.\xc2\xa0 Some of the affiliates, such as Libya, it\xe2\x80\x99s ISIL taking advantage of an anarchic situation.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not sending paratroopers into certain areas to start a franchise.\xc2\xa0 Boko Haram is a preexisting problem, preexisting terrorist organization that now flies the flag of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So just because you have an ISIL affiliate pop up, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean suddenly it\xe2\x80\x99s a fundamentally different situation.\xc2\xa0 These are mostly locally driven events.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLibya is a little different; that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it. \xc2\xa0But we look at how they recruit, and they recruit on three levels.\xc2\xa0 One is these kind of sun-drenched scenes of the caliphate, and come live in this historic movement.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually a vast majority of their propaganda -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s a historic movement, it\xe2\x80\x99s expanding, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go all the way to Rome, and come be a part of it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s like 60 percent of the propaganda is that.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much attention because the second part is the gore and violence and the mayhem.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty small category of their propaganda.\xc2\xa0 And then they have a religiously based message, which they also put out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that first primary propaganda effort on their part is no longer credible.\xc2\xa0 So their chief spokesman, Adnani, when he speaks now, he is very much on the defensive, trying to explain, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, here\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all this territory, but we\xe2\x80\x99re coming back.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a totally different message.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not inspiring people, I think, like it was 18 months ago.\xc2\xa0 I mean, 18 months ago, when I\xe2\x80\x99d be in Malaysia or Australia, there was a sense that ISIL was just totally on the march, and that was having an effect, a radicalizing effect.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the case anymore.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking.\xc2\xa0 Their leaders are dying.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Jonathan, I\xe2\x80\x99d just make the point, which I made in the beginning.\xc2\xa0 Nobody here, working on this every day, is under any illusions for how difficult this is going to be, for how lethal this organization remains; for how hard it is to build not only a global coalition with all these different countries, but also a coalition of different actors on the ground; to be cohesive -- like I said, all these different shards of wood, to turn them into a bat to really fight.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really hard.\xc2\xa0 And given that, I think if you look at where we were 18 months ago until now, I think you can now see the progress and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see more I think over the coming months.\xc2\xa0 But nobody is under any illusions for how hard this is going to be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Tara, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let Brett go.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your presentation.\xc2\xa0 I liked the maps.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re very helpful.\xc2\xa0 And obviously you thought about this so carefully, it\xe2\x80\x99s really interesting to hear your perspective on it.\xc2\xa0 And I liked the way you described how the global perspective of the 125 countries.\xc2\xa0 You talked about the moral imperative, so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering you can tell me more about where that comes from.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you talked about how they put the women into slavery, but then also, where does that lead the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this is an organization that enslaves women, it destroys our common heritage, it murders anybody that disagrees with them.\xc2\xa0 So it speaks for itself.\xc2\xa0 But I was in northern Iraq with the Peshmerga before they did the Sinjar operation, and you could get a sense from the fighters and from President Barzani and the commanders that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply a mission against a brutal enemy; it\xe2\x80\x99s against an enemy that is just different for what it\xe2\x80\x99s done to people.\xc2\xa0 It also, though, exemplifies why the post-ISIL is so hard.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a story from that meeting, before that operation began.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tA very senior Peshmerga commander told me he was dealing with all the local leaders, particularly the Yazidis, who are from this area, about, after the operation, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to govern and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to take charge.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on, once areas are cleared, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have revenge attacks and tit for tat, because that can begin to unravel things very fast.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that in the past.\xc2\xa0 And this Peshmerga commander told me he was discussing this with an elderly Yazidi civilian from this area, talking about this fact -- what comes after -- and he said the Yazidi elderly man said, you know, these people, Daesh, they took my wife, they took my three daughters, they took my sister, and all I have left in this life is my revenge against these people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done to the psychology in some of these places.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re working to do, as we clear out ISIL, is try to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s a way -- working with the U.N. and the coalition -- to restore life to these areas so you don\xe2\x80\x99t get into these cycles of revenge.\xc2\xa0 But, I mean, your question hit on something for why not only is it imperative upon all of us to defeat this enemy, but also imperative upon all of us to focus on what comes after.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Brett.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. MCGURK:\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I know the map up here was a little hard to read from there.\xc2\xa0 We have copies of the map that we can distribute on paper, so just contact our office and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure that we can get you a copy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But obviously Brett\xe2\x80\x99s experience in the region and the amount of work that he has put into this makes him I think a pretty useful messenger in helping all of you and your readers and viewers and listeners understand exactly what our strategy is and what we are focused on to advance the interests of the United States but also to keep the American people safe.\xc2\xa0 And that work is ongoing at a rather rapid pace, even on those days when it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the headlines.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s actually rare for Brett to spend a day in Washington, D.C. and so I thought it was important to make sure that we try to make sure that all of you were on his schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where is he usually based?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, he is based here, but he spends so much time traveling in the region that it\xe2\x80\x99s unusual for him to spend an entire workday here in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 So we were pleased to have a little bit of his attention today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He was good.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So with all that, Kevin, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to your questions on other topics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to turn to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 So should Senate Republicans take the advice of Joe Biden from 1992 when he said action on Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over, or Joe Biden of 2016 who insists the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should get full consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, I\xe2\x80\x99d go with both.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Because Vice President Biden in 1992, in the same speech that you noted, said if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support, as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve observed in the past that we can spend a lot of time sort of throwing quotes back and forth, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of indicative of some comments that the President made last week about how this process has become politicized.\xc2\xa0 But when you consider the record of Senator Biden and his service on the Judiciary Committee, it\xe2\x80\x99s a record that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to beat.\xc2\xa0 When you consider that he presided over the last time that the Senate voted to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in an election year, that was a nominee that was put forward by a Republican President, and Joe Biden was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and ensured that Justice Kennedy got both a fair hearing and a timely yes-or-no vote.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking the Senate to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of examples of this.\xc2\xa0 Senator Biden, more than anyone else, has ensured the fair confirmation of nine Supreme Court Justices.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any other senator that can stake a claim to that kind of record.\xc2\xa0 He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just in the United States Senate so that he could confirm Supreme Court justices appointed by Democrats -- he often presided even in difficult situations, like an election year, of ensuring that even appointees of a Republican President were confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I know there\xe2\x80\x99s often this old adage that sometimes politicians are reduced to the expression that people should do as I say, not as I did.\xc2\xa0 In this instance, we actually want the Republicans in the Senate to do precisely as Vice President Biden did when he served in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And if so, it will allow the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee when he puts that individual forward to get a fair hearing, to get a timely yes-or-no vote, and for the Supreme Court of the United States to function precisely as the Founders intended.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, senators are going to pick and choose quotes.\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge that the comments -- Senator McConnell was speaking on the Senate floor quoting the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 Would you acknowledge that this has made more difficult, more unlikely that the nominee will get a hearing and a vote this year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would not, precisely because of Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s record when he served on the Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me give you -- I mean, I said the examples of Justice Kennedy and his overall record of confirming Supreme Court justices.\xc2\xa0 There are other elements of his record that are just as enlightening.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden, when he presided over the confirmation hearing of Justice Thomas, he did not support Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to the Supreme Court, but yet he allowed Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to move through the Judiciary Committee and move onto the floor of the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is exactly the kind of commitment to the functioning of the institution of the United States Senate that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Republicans demonstrate.\xc2\xa0 And again, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a matter of doing as Senator Biden recommends -- as then-Senator Biden recommended.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going as then-Senator Biden actually did.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re counting on Republicans in the United States Senate to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it because they are forced into some position based on awkward quotes that they themselves have given -- and goodness knows there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how long this goes; maybe we can discuss some of those as well.\xc2\xa0 But in some ways, the most important element of this is they have a constitutional duty.\xc2\xa0 They swore to uphold an oath and to fulfill the responsibility that the institution of the United States Senate has to consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, to give that individual a fair hearing, and to give that person a yes-or-no vote.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know there are at least two Senate Republicans yesterday who acknowledged that oath and acknowledged that if the President -- when the President nominates someone, that hearings should go forward.\xc2\xa0 Senator Kirk himself specifically referenced the oath that he took not just as a member of the United States Senate, but also as a member of our armed forces.\xc2\xa0 He certainly takes that oath seriously, and he recognizes that giving the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee a fair hearing is what that oath requires.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully he will be able to persuade other members in his conference of the importance of that oath.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ayesha.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Turning to the report on Guantanamo Bay, why not name the 13 facilities considered, or at least make -- and also to make a recommendation for a facility to move the transferees that would be left over?\xc2\xa0 Part of what the administration is saying is they kind of want to -- you want to rise above politics with this issue and to have Congress move forward.\xc2\xa0 But are political concerns keeping you from naming these facilities?\xc2\xa0 And is it a concern about not wanting to put certain lawmakers on the spot if you name certain facilities or put them on the table?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ayesha, you won\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised to hear that the reason that the administration can\xe2\x80\x99t undertake a more thorough and detailed evaluation of a specific site is because it\xe2\x80\x99s specifically prevented by Congress.\xc2\xa0 Congress passed a statute that instructed and has prevented the administration from undertaking serious planning that would be required to do the prudent thing, which is close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and to take those individuals who cannot be safely transferred to other countries and incarcerate them here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is a common-sense proposal, as the plan that we rolled out today makes clear.\xc2\xa0 It would save taxpayers billions of dollars over a couple of decades, or at least $1.7 billion over a couple of decades.\xc2\xa0 And we would be eager -- in fact, we are asking Congress to work with us to allow us to do the kind of planning that needs to be done to do this safely and in a cost-effective fashion.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need congressional cooperation in order to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tCongressional cooperation in this instance is a reference to Congress actually removing a barrier that prevents that from happening.\xc2\xa0 And if Congress is willing to act on that, then we\'ll be able to move in a direction of actually having serious discussions about specific plans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Department of Defense, I know, has indicated that these kinds of plans could be initiated in relatively short order.\xc2\xa0 So this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to be a longer-term goal, but what we need to see in the short term is a willingness on the part of the United States Congress to put the interest of our national security ahead of the interest of their politics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that this law is the law that\'s preventing -- or that prevented the administration from putting forward a more detailed plan?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this was a nine-page plan not including the appendix.\xc2\xa0 So it seemed kind of sparse.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that it was legislation, laws that have been passed that prevented you from going into more detail?\xc2\xa0 And also, if it\'s the case, if it\'s you need Congress to act to pass laws to remove these restrictions, if they don\'t move, what is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s plan going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me be clear about this.\xc2\xa0 The administration is constrained by law from undertaking designed or detailed planning for a U.S.-based facility.\xc2\xa0 And that hinders our ability to put forward the kind of details that you\'re suggesting.\xc2\xa0 However, what we were able to do within the confines of the law is to develop a plan based on a prototype detention facility, essentially a model that could give us an estimate about what that looks like.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What that looks like is a savings to the taxpayers of up to $85 million a year.\xc2\xa0 Over about 10 years, that\'s a net savings, once you\xe2\x80\x99ve factored in the transition costs, of more than $300 million over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 And those costs explode over the longer term -- we\'re talking a savings of about $1.7 billion in net savings over 20 years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is a clear argument.\xc2\xa0 The facts bear this out --\xc2\xa0 even in our nine-page report -- you can take a look at the numbers and see that there is a significant benefit for taxpayers of doing something that is clearly within our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 It is not just President Obama who thinks that closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay would advance our national security; President Bush held the same view.\xc2\xa0 Senator McCain, at one point, even held the same view.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously the view of our Department of Defense that issued this report.\xc2\xa0 This is the view of \xc2\xa060 retired generals and other senior military officers who wrote a letter to the *President Congress today, announcing their support for this plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We hear a lot of rhetoric on the campaign trail that the President needs to do a better job of listening to his military commanders and military leaders.\xc2\xa0 This is what our military leaders suggest is necessary to enhance our national security.\xc2\xa0 And right now, it is Congress who isn\'t just listening to them -- failing to listen to them, it\'s Congress who is actively blocking these steps to save taxpayers money and to make our country safer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Josh, given what you just said, and given what Loretta Lynch said back in November when she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to individuals being transferred to the United States, the law currently does not allow that.\xc2\xa0 Certainly it is the position of the Department of Justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard to that issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So given that it would be against the law to bring detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the United States, is it safe to say that if Congress does not act to change the law, then the prison at Guantanamo Bay will not be closed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, I\'m not ready to arrive at that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 What we\'re focused on right now is congressional consideration of a plan that they specifically asked for so that we can have a discussion about the best path forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s clear, based on the fact that we\'ve submitted this plan to Congress right on the deadline and the time frame that they asked for, that we\'re interested in a robust consultation about this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but wait a minute.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t understand how you can say that you\'re not willing to rule that out.\xc2\xa0 It\'s against the law.\xc2\xa0 The law says, as I think you just said from the podium, and certainly the Attorney General of the United States said in congressional testimony, and in fact, the Defense Secretary said just last month in congressional testimony, it is against the law to move those detainees to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So unless you\'re just going to let them all go, how could you close down that prison?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, nobody is talking about letting them all go.\xc2\xa0 So we put forward this very specific plan for how these individuals can either be safely transferred to other countries, how they can go through a criminal justice process, or how they can be safely incarcerated here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That is a cost-effective plan that is consistent with our national security interest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the congressional reaction to that plan, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, what I have seen is the plan that we have put forward actually lay out exactly why what our argument is reflects the facts. It reflects the facts that we can save money by doing it in the way that we\'ve outlined, and it reflects the need to protect our national security.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re interested in a serious conversation with Congress about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, there is this emerging trend in Congress that has worsened in just the last few weeks where Congress isn\'t simply in a position of just saying no; Congress is actually refusing to engage.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not just actively saying no, they\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to do the basic function of their job.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to consider this specific Gitmo plan.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to even consider the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re refusing to even take any sort of action on an AUMF.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to even convene a hearing to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director -- something that has happened every year for the last 40 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not really sure exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Congress.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re doing just about everything except for fulfilling their basic constitutional responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this case, Congress actually has acted, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve acted repeatedly, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve acted to vote in a bipartisan fashion to say no, they don\'t want detainees from Guantanamo Bay brought to the United States.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m asking you, if they don\'t act on this, if they don\'t approve this plan that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just outlined, can the President still close that detention facility before he leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, Congress specifically --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes or no, can he still do it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Congress specifically requested this plan on this time frame, and we have provided it to them.\xc2\xa0 So, again, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to decide whether or not they actually want to take a look at this.\xc2\xa0 What they have done thus far, as you point out, is put in place barriers that have prevented the administration from moving forward in this way.\xc2\xa0 But by putting those barriers in place, they have led us down the path of a policy that wastes taxpayer dollars and makes the United States of America more vulnerable to terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not answering my -- it\'s a really simple question.\xc2\xa0 If those barriers remain in place, can you still close that facility, yes or no?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President himself has considered this question, and what he has said publicly is that our focus is going to be on working with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And working with Congress requires presenting them a specific plan on the time frame that they asked for.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what we\'ve done.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re now asking for Congress to give it fair consideration.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to speculate at this point if Congress refuses to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 Marco Rubio today suggested that the President is also considering turning over the entire naval base to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that in the white paper.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that is under consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not under consideration, and we\'ve said that many times.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In deciding the cost savings over a 20-year period -- does that mean the American people should expect that some of these inmates will be held for 20 more years, in some cases without charge?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Scott, in some cases, we\'re talking about individuals who were initially apprehended and transferred to the prison at Guantanamo Bay at pretty young ages, as teenagers.\xc2\xa0 So it does mean that we need to start thinking long term about how this process is going to work.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, our preference is, where possible, to conduct the review and determine how these individuals can be transferred to other countries, with appropriate security restraints to make sure that we are mitigating any risk that they may pose to the United States.\xc2\xa0 There is a long process for certifying that.\xc2\xa0 It requires a specific approval of the Secretary of Defense before an individual can be transferred.\xc2\xa0 But there are about 35 individuals who are currently detained at the prison at Guantanamo Bay who are eligible for that process.\xc2\xa0 We just need to find a willing partner overseas who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to receive that individual and put in place the security restraints that we believe are necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'ve discussed at some length the options for bringing these individuals to justice, either through military commissions or through Article 3 courts.\xc2\xa0 The President made an allusion to some reforms of that process that he believes would make military commissions, in particular, themselves more cost-effective and efficient.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, some of you also may have seen earlier today a tweet from the Chief of Staff who indicated that right now we have a situation at the prison at Guantanamo Bay that it\'s not possible for some individuals to actually just plead guilty.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an indication that we need to fix a broken system.\xc2\xa0 And right now, again, as Jon pointed out, all we\'ve seen are Congress throwing up obstacles.\xc2\xa0 And what we would like to see is Congress engage with us on this plan so that we can act in the best interest of taxpayers, that we can act in the best interest of our national security, and that we don\'t end up in a situation where this unwieldy problem ends up on the plate of the next President, whoever that person may be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, people on the Hill are calling this dead on arrival.\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the plan was put forward just a couple of hours ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This plan that they\xe2\x80\x99re saying is dead on arrival.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty inconsistent.\xc2\xa0 So I guess, look, I guess you have to ask Congress if they were pretty disingenuous in making the request that we actually send them a plan.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like they didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually take it very seriously.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I actually think that just reinforces a pretty significant problem that Congress has right now.\xc2\xa0 I think by anybody who is paying attention, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to figure out exactly what Congress is doing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not doing their job.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not considering a plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve ruled out consideration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve refused to take any sort of tangible action on an authorization to use military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And they won\xe2\x80\x99t even engage in a hearing with the President\xe2\x80\x99 budget director on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal in the same way that every Congress for the last 40 years has.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Congress right now.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on right now is doing the job of the American people -- making sure that we are being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and looking out for our national security.\xc2\xa0 And so I think in each of those instances, what you have is you have the administration trying to move the country forward and trying to set politics aside and actually focus on the best interests of the country.\xc2\xa0 On the part of Congress, you see nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if the President and what you\xe2\x80\x99re describing is that the White House is really trying to work with Congress and, in many ways, dependent on Congress to get this prison closed, but in the face of that intractable opposition, is the President willing to leave office with Guantanamo Bay still open?\xc2\xa0 Is he ready to admit defeat?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That surely is not his preference.\xc2\xa0 As the President noted today --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it a possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- I remember standing -- sitting in that chair, right over there, and I believe it was January 22nd, 2009, where the President put forward his specific plan for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about this in detailed fashion for more than seven years.\xc2\xa0 This has been a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And at each turn, we have been stymied by Congress, and that\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating.\xc2\xa0 But that frustration pales in comparison to how irresponsible it is to treat taxpayer dollars and our national security in that way.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you just going to let the clock keep ticking?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a year left here, and time is of the essence, as the White House keeps saying.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now, it appears that Congress is going to let the clock tick without doing anything.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put together --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Gitmo will stay open after President Obama leaves office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward a very specific plan for ensuring that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that somebody in Congress somewhere will actually take a serious look at this, be willing to put the national security of the United States and the importance of efficient use of taxpayer dollars ahead of their own personal political considerations.\xc2\xa0 I recognize that that may be a bold consideration to make in Washington, D.C. these days, particularly in an election year, but it\xe2\x80\x99s what the American people expect and it\xe2\x80\x99s what the Constitution requires.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you address -- the President talked about what he saw as this sort of scary idea for people -- moving terrorists closer to the U.S. mainland and, in some ways, to their own backyard.\xc2\xa0 Given that there are, among these 91 people here, still about 46 who can\xe2\x80\x99t be cleared out, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough evidence against them, but there\xe2\x80\x99s too much worry to release them.\xc2\xa0 Moving those people to the U.S. mainland, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just shifting the same problem to another zip code so that the next President faces the exact same problem of indefinite detention of detainees with no clear sign of avoiding what has become what the White House says is a rallying point for terrorists?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot there, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised what I think is an important question -- several important questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first thing, as the President referenced in his statement in the Roosevelt Room earlier today, is that there are hardened, dangerous terrorists who, right now, even as we speak -- dozens of them -- who are serving time in American prisons on American soil, right now.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the United States more vulnerable, it makes us safer.\xc2\xa0 They have gone through a criminal justice process where they have been convicted and they are serving time, and they are being held where they cannot pose a threat to the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in this case, many of these detainees, it is not nearly as clear cut in terms of the evidence and in terms of the trial.\xc2\xa0 And that is one of the problems along these many years with closing the facility, is how do you get around all that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So there are a group of people where that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply; where we should be able to find a justice process of one form or another that will allow the justice to be served.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is there is a process that was put in place on January 22nd of 2009 that initiated a formal review of the files of these individuals who were detained to determine how and where they could be safely transferred.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to implement that process to determine if there are more individuals who, based on an updated intelligence assessment and based on updated diplomatic conversations with our partners, could be safely transferred somewhere else in a way that is consistent with our national security interests.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that more people from the group of 46 or 56 that we have here, that they could be moved into the category of eligible-for-transfer.\xc2\xa0 And that is a testament to the success of the process that the administration put in place on the President\xe2\x80\x99s second full day in office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But look, the final thing is, the option is -- the other option that right now Congress is nudging us in the direction of is one that only serves to exacerbate our national security vulnerabilities.\xc2\xa0 It only allows extremist organizations to continue to use the operation of the prison at Guantanamo Bay as a recruiting tool.\xc2\xa0 We know that they do that.\xc2\xa0 And why we give them that weapon to use against us is beyond me.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that the dollars and cents here just don\xe2\x80\x99t add up to a logical, Republican congressional strategy.\xc2\xa0 Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s some Democrats who are complicit in this too.\xc2\xa0 So this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- members of Congress suggesting that we continue to operate the prison at Guantanamo Bay even after we\xe2\x80\x99ve transferred all those individuals who are eligible for transfer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t add up.\xc2\xa0 The per-inmate cost of the prison at Guantanamo Bay is only going to continue to skyrocket.\xc2\xa0 And when you look at the longer-term cost implications -- well, look, even in the short term it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the short term, we could recoup the transfer costs in three to five years, but essentially be in a situation where we are saving taxpayers up to $85 million each year by moving these individuals to U.S. soil.\xc2\xa0 Over the long term, the cost savings are even more significant.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you consider just the dollars and cents here, when you\xe2\x80\x99re a fiscal conservative and looking at making sure that government is smaller and that taxpayer dollars are effectively used and efficiently used, that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to cut wasteful spending, $85 million a year -- that seems like a pretty sizable amount.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on the numbers of this?\xc2\xa0 It seems like this plan was delayed for many months, basically as you guys tried to get the cost squared away.\xc2\xa0 And it does sound like you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have 30 to 60 individuals, and even though you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be saving $85 million, it\xe2\x80\x99s still hundreds of millions of dollars -- probably over $200 million -- for 30 to 60 individuals.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that cost is something that the President is comfortable with.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s still a per-prisoner cost of several million dollars.\xc2\xa0 So is that something the President is comfortable with?\xc2\xa0 Is that something you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to get -- you\xe2\x80\x99re tried to get that number down more, and struggled with that?\xc2\xa0 And is that the reason why the plan was delayed so long?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, Toluse, I think what is true is that once we have an opportunity to take a closer look more specifically at the way that a U.S. facility could be used, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that there might be some additional cost savings.\xc2\xa0 But we can\xe2\x80\x99t do that important work until Congress agrees to start working with us to see if that\xe2\x80\x99s even possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI guess in the same way that it costs money to run prisons in the United States, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to cost money to detain these individuals, even if we bring them to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Releasing them, at least in some cases, is not an option.\xc2\xa0 So shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we just try to find the most cost-effective way to do it?\xc2\xa0 And isn\xe2\x80\x99t it ridiculous and irresponsible to suggest that we should just wantonly spend an extra $85 million a year to keep these individuals at a prison at Guantanamo Bay that, oh,\xc2\xa0 by the way, terrorists actually use as a recruiting tool?\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a not a good way to run the country.\xc2\xa0 It certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best way to look out for our national security, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a good way to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of our case here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people who are strong on national security, people who are serious fiscal conservatives, people who are willing to listen to the advice of our military commanders, you sound a little like a Republican trying to make a foreign policy decision -- at least how Republican candidates for President suggest they would make foreign policy decisions.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s start living up to our rhetoric here and actually do the right thing for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The NDAA kind of specifically called for the administration to put out a specific name of a facility or facilities.\xc2\xa0 And I know you said that the law also kind of restricts you from doing the research that you need to do, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict you from naming facilities that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at.\xc2\xa0 DOD didn\xe2\x80\x99t look at facilities last year, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t restrict you from sort of maybe narrowing the pocket down to just a few facilities that you\xe2\x80\x99re actually considering.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering why the administration didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, because that\xe2\x80\x99s a criticism that you\xe2\x80\x99re getting from the Hill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the reason that these site visits were made was to inform our development of prototype facilities that would allow us to take a look at exactly how this would be done.\xc2\xa0 But we are prohibited by law from developing the kind of specifics and details around a specific facility.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo look, this is exactly part of what congressional engagement should be.\xc2\xa0 We should have a discussion about where this kind of facility would be located.\xc2\xa0 So if there are Republicans that have strong ideas about what would be a good place, then they should bring forward those ideas.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re happy to have that discussion.\xc2\xa0 We can take a close look at whether that would meet our requirements and whether that would actually bring about the kind of tax savings that we envision.\xc2\xa0 We would welcome that kind of discussion on the part of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But right now, Congress has passed a law that prevents that conversation from taking place.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not consistent with anybody\xe2\x80\x99s idea about what it means to do your job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 There have been several district attorneys who have said that they\xe2\x80\x99re also looking to get a \xe2\x80\x9cbackdoor\xe2\x80\x9d into phones and that if this case does go forward and Apple does cooperate with the FBI, there\xe2\x80\x99s not just going to be this one phone -- they have several phones that they\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to use as well in this same way.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve made it sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to be this one isolated case, but is there a threat that other district attorneys across the country will be able to use this case as a way to get into phones for other types of cases that aren\xe2\x80\x99t terrorism related?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say, Toluse, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the details of other cases that may be out there.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let prosecutors, if they have cases that they think are comparable to this, to make their own case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about is this very specific request that the Department of Justice and our independent investigators at the FBI have made to a judge.\xc2\xa0 They haven\xe2\x80\x99t sought to do this on their own; they have gone through a judicial process, through a legal process, to obtain access to a phone that was used by a terrorist, that is no longer living, that was actually the property and was owned by the local government in California.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99ve limited my comments to this specific request.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to other requests that may be out there.\xc2\xa0 If there are additional requests that have to be made by local prosecutors, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go before a judge.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of exactly the case that we have been making, which is I have not stood up here and suggested that the FBI should be able to decide whether or not they get access to this phone.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve also stood up here and said that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Apple who decides who gets access to this phone.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a court of law and there is a procedure in place to determine and to weigh the merits of the arguments that are made by both sides.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, a judge has come down on the side of the independent investigators at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And given the way the President has made this investigation a priority -- because information that is yielded in the investigation could be relevant to continuing to protect the American people -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that the FBI will continue to do its important work.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Is it your understanding that the NSA is still in the practice of collecting bulk metadata?\xc2\xa0 And if so, if that\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the FBI simply go to them to get the information that they claim they need from this particular device?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kevin, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that last year Congress passed legislation to reform this program, to ensure that the intelligence community would no longer be in the business of collecting that bulk metadata that was included in Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\xc2\xa0 So that is no longer taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there is no collection, to your understanding, of bulk phone records at all?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I know, based on the law that was passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support, is it made critical reforms that actually put telephone companies in a position to collect that data and with a court order, the law enforcement officials could conduct the kind of searches that are critical to our national security.\xc2\xa0 But it would not be a situation where the U.S. government was in a position of holding that data ourselves.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me follow up on something Margaret was asking you about, and this is sort of a broader question about detainees.\xc2\xa0 Considering there is ongoing battle in theaters all over the globe involving terrorists, where are they being held, once they\xe2\x80\x99re captured?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, there is a process for this.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sort of envision in our mind how this might work.\xc2\xa0 We have time and time again demonstrated that we can, when it comes to terrorists who are apprehended in the United States, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a process in place where we can make sure that they are subject to robust interrogation, that our intelligence officials can use that information to enhance our national security, that we can get the information we need out of them to make sure that we can keep the American people safe, and then we can turn them over to law enforcement interrogators who can put them through the Justice system.\xc2\xa0 Those individuals have been convicted, and some of them, many of them are actually serving time right now on American soil, in American prison facilities, no longer posing a threat to our national security.\xc2\xa0 We have a system in place that works, that keeps the American people safe and lives up to our values.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the ones captured on the battlefield?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in Syria -- so, for example, they\xe2\x80\x99re not being transported back here.\xc2\xa0 Where are they held?\xc2\xa0 Because the argument that some are making now is since we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in ongoing battle that involves terrorists that may be apprehended on the battlefield that don\xe2\x80\x99t represent a particular country, they have to be housed somewhere, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be detained. And the argument that some are making is that a facility like Guantanamo is still going to be important moving forward, even beyond the 91 current detainees.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is, over the last seven years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve waged a very aggressive campaign -- a counterterrorism campaign all around the world.\xc2\xa0 And that has been in Iraq, that\xe2\x80\x99s been in Syria, that\xe2\x80\x99s been in Afghanistan, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been in a variety of other countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 Not one prisoner has been transferred or added to the population at the prison at Guantanamo Bay since President Obama took office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re being held abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And this woman was facing very serious charges related to ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s hostage-taking activities.\xc2\xa0 That individual has faced a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Right now, that individual is in the custody of Kurdish officials and is going through the Kurdish criminal justice system.\xc2\xa0 That individual has also been indicted by the Department of Justice for her complicity in hostage-taking activities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But given her terrorist background, she\xe2\x80\x99s in custody and she no longer is posing a threat to U.S. national security.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one textbook example of how, on a case-by-case basis, we can make sure we take actions that put the safety and security of the American people at the top of the list, but also make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re acting consistent with our values.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So essentially what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is because these facilities exist, would it not be then possible to take some of the detainees that are currently housed at Guantanamo and move them to some of these other facilities, ultimately emptying out the prison in Cuba?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, what we would have to do is we would have to evaluate the security measures in place at those other facilities, and we\xe2\x80\x99d also have to get the agreement --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They must be pretty strong if they\xe2\x80\x99re housing terrorists like the one you just mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- but we also have to -- well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking, in some cases, about terrorists who may pose a significant threat.\xc2\xa0 And so we need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the security measures in place to keep them safe.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing -- and I think this goes back to the core problem with the prison at Guantanamo Bay -- why would another country want to take them?\xc2\xa0 Why would they want to take on that problem?\xc2\xa0 Members of the United States Congress certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take on that problem, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that was created by the United States government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for us to resolve this situation before the next President takes office, because it ends up being a sticking point in our relationships with friends and allies and partners with whom we have other important business to conduct.\xc2\xa0 And this lingering issue is one that only serves to cloud the agenda that already has a lot of high-profile and high-priority national security items on it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 On the high court -- is it your concern that if what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now, or what appears to be happening now, which is it\xe2\x80\x99s become political and it may not -- this particular nominee may not get an up-or-down vote, or even a hearing -- that when the tables have turned and eventually the Democrats are in control, that this will happen again, this will cloud the process in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no denying that what Republicans are threatening to do in the context of this Supreme Court nominee is unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 Since 1875, a President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee has never been denied a hearing unless that President later withdrew that nomination.\xc2\xa0 And this would be an historic and unprecedented acceleration of politicizing a branch of government that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be insulated from politics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while there -- as the President has acknowledged, there are Democrats and Republicans who are responsible for contributing to that.\xc2\xa0 There is no denying that what Leader McConnell and other Republicans are proposing to do right now would turbocharge that process and may, in some ways, subject the Supreme Court to the kind of politics that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been insulated from for more than two centuries.\xc2\xa0 And that would be a shame.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd fortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only person that\xe2\x80\x99s making that argument.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen statements from people like Senator Kirk, Senator Collins.\xc2\xa0 Even somebody like Senator Blunt, a Republican from my home state of Missouri, has indicated that he believes that this nominee should get a hearing.\xc2\xa0 So, again, in some ways, if I were sitting in your chair, the observation that I would make is there\xe2\x80\x99s actually not bipartisan support for blocking the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee; in fact, there is actually bipartisan support for making sure this individual gets a hearing, a fair one, and gets a timely yes-or-no vote.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll get.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just today, in Spain, a former Gitmo detainee was arrested as a suspected terrorist recruiting for ISIS.\xc2\xa0 Officials there said that he was a leader who was trained in weapons and explosives.\xc2\xa0 Does that matter?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does matter.\xc2\xa0 Because of the changes that this administration put in place, again, back on January 22nd of 2009, the recidivism rate that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from individuals who have been transferred under the formula that was put in place by the Obama administration, that recidivism rate is in the single digits.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s quite small.\xc2\xa0 And it underscores how important it is for us to have in place the appropriate security arrangements for when we transfer an individual to another country.\xc2\xa0 We can do this safely.\xc2\xa0 We know how to do this.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s both in our national security interest, but it also is much more cost-effective than what\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s say just one or two of the thirty-five that are potentially going to be transferred went back to fight for ISIS -- and this example today, I mean, this is somebody who is in Europe while the United States is fighting ISIS.\xc2\xa0 So of this new batch, let\xe2\x80\x99s say the recidivism rate is only in the single digits, at this period of time, when we\xe2\x80\x99re at war and ISIS is acting in other countries beside Iraq and Syria, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a significant threat?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a threat that we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of.\xc2\xa0 But again, according to your own reporting, this individual has been apprehended by authorities.\xc2\xa0 The other thing, Michelle, is that if we know we\xe2\x80\x99re at war with terrorist organizations that are seeking to radicalize populations around the globe, and we know that the prison at Guantanamo Bay is a prominent recruiting tool that they use, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we take that away from them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, even the gory videos that were released by ISIL a couple of summers ago evoked some of the themes and imagery from the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 We know that they are seeking to capitalize on that as a propaganda victory, and we should take that away from them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So taking those same guys and transferring them to prisons in the U.S., wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that then just become the recruiting tool?\xc2\xa0 As the argument has been, if there were to be some violent protests surrounding that, then it would be on U.S. soil.\xc2\xa0 So I guess at the crux of it --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a legitimate argument because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that there are any huge protests that are taking place on Cuban soil right now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then just as a recruiting tool, your argument that Gitmo itself is the recruiting tool, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the recruiting tool then just be transferring to having these guys still held indefinitely in the U.S. be the same thing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, their argument would be a lot tougher because the detention that we would have in place would be cleanly in line with American values; that we would ensure that this is consistent with the way that American citizens are treated.\xc2\xa0 That certainly is more consideration than these terrorists give to their adversaries, to say the least.\xc2\xa0 But we would be on quite strong moral ground to say that these individuals are being treated humanely, that the conditions in which they are detained are safe and clean and reasonable.\xc2\xa0 And we would be taking away an important propaganda tool that we know that extremist organizations, like ISIL, capitalize on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBrett was just standing here at this podium talking about how we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the threat that ISIL poses because of their ability to radicalize people around the globe.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that a little harder for them.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in addition to what we heard the Attorney General say not too long again, we just saw the Joint Chief send a letter to the Hill reiterating that, that it would be illegal based on current law to transfer people to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So given what we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard now, several officials say, surrounding the illegality of making a transfer like that, why are you not ruling out executive action to do something more at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take any of the President\xe2\x80\x99s options off the table.\xc2\xa0 But that certainly is not what our focus is right now.\xc2\xa0 Our focus right now is quite clear, given that we have presented to Congress exactly the plan that they asked for on exactly the time frame that they asked for.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'re asking for is legitimate consideration be given to the plan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a very strong case to make about how the plan that we have put forward would save taxpayer dollars and make the American people safer.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the essence of our plan, and it\'s time for members of Congress to put their own political considerations aside and actually consider what\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of the national security of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know you\'re saying -- that\'s your focus.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s hard to ignore what so many have said surrounding what\xe2\x80\x99s legal and what\xe2\x80\x99s not, including the Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 So how can you still say that executive action is possible?\xc2\xa0 That would put a severe limit on what the President could do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\'ve been clear about is that we are focused on congressional action and getting Congress to actually act on the plan that we have presented there today.\xc2\xa0 If they do that, that would make any sort of discussion about the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions obsolete.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re going to go ahead and continue to put pressure on Congress to do the right thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President could still take executive action on Gitmo, is that what you\'re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that what we\'re focused on right now is Congress taking action.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not going to stand up here and unilaterally take any options off the table when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s use of his executive authority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, speaking of action in Congress, McConnell now is saying that a hearing is not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 It\'s now the consensus of those on the Judiciary Committee that it\'s just not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 So how does this change the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reach-out to the Hill and your strategy in general?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that since we last met here that the President did make some additional calls to members of Congress, including some Republicans, including people who served on the Judiciary Committee.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have specific names at this point.\xc2\xa0 But that outreach continues and it will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would just observe that while Senator McConnell may claim some unanimity of opinion among Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, he cannot claim unanimity of opinion when it comes to Republicans in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we\'ve seen unambiguous statements from people like Senator Kirk and Senator Collins that they believe that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should get a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI certainly value their opinion.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator McConnell does, too.\xc2\xa0 But I think the opinion that we all value the most is what\xe2\x80\x99s required by the United States Constitution.\xc2\xa0 And the institution of the United States Senate has a duty to function and ensure that the Supreme Court of the United States has what\xe2\x80\x99s required to function as the Founders intended.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you still think there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that this -- that hearings would happen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Again, based on what people like Senator Kirk, Senator Collins; I know that Senator Coats has also indicated that he believes that -- he said that \xe2\x80\x9cif the President nominates someone which is his choice, I think that person would deserve a hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Senator Blunt said, \xe2\x80\x9cI certainly don\'t mind taking a vote on this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Neither Senator Coats, nor Senator Blunt represents a state that President Obama won in the reelection of 2012.\xc2\xa0 Neither of them would describe themselves as a moderate.\xc2\xa0 Both of them are conservative Republicans, but both of them are out there saying publicly that if the President nominates somebody, they\xe2\x80\x99re ready to vote on them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I guess it will make for an interesting caucus meeting when Senator McConnell brings together the members of his Senate.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re having lunch right now.\xc2\xa0 I guess --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- every member of the Judiciary Committee signed a letter saying no hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not sure -- I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the meeting, obviously.\xc2\xa0 I was standing right here.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure what Senator Kirk, Senator Collins, Senator Blunt or Senator Coats has to say about it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ll do a couple more hands in the back.\xc2\xa0 Jordan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Back to Gitmo.\xc2\xa0 We were told earlier today that there was outreach to relevant congressional parties on the White House\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and I was wondering if you could expand on which members were informed about the plan before it was released through the outreach and whether the President has personally called members of Congress to discuss the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that for you and we\'ll see if we can get you some more details.\xc2\xa0 I know that there was extensive congressional consultation that occurred before the plan was formally released.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if I can get you some greater detail about how exactly that took place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSarah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, you\xe2\x80\x99ve given Congress the plan that it asked for, as you put it.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is citing kind of the broad ban on spending money to move detainees to the U.S. as why you can\'t give a specific site.\xc2\xa0 But the same law, the NDAA, Section 1035 says that this report that you have given, that Congress asked for, says that the report is supposed to include the specific facility or facilities that are intended to be used or modified to use, et cetera, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 So why -- how are you fulfilling Congress\xe2\x80\x99s request for that specific data?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think what this highlights that every year in the NDAA, the can\'t writes in language that specifically prohibits the administration from undertaking plans that would lay the groundwork for bringing individuals from the prison at Guantanamo Bay into the United States.\xc2\xa0 So I think you have highlighted yet another example of congressional dysfunction that they have written a law that includes varying guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the truth is there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason we have to sort of go through all of this.\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t we just have members of Congress who actually are willing to put politics aside, focus on the best interest of the United States, and have a serious conversation with the administration about the most effective way for us to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, save taxpayer dollars, and remove a recruiting tool that we know that ISIL is eager to use?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator McCain, who you have noted, when he ran against the President, said that he also supported closing Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s now the Armed Services Committee Chairman. And he said that the report today is a vague menu of options, not a credible plan for closing Guantanamo, let alone a coherent policy to deal with future terrorist detainees.\xc2\xa0 Is Senator McCain just being cynical and political?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask him how he arrived at his conclusions.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think the facts here are pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear exactly how the American people can save money by closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve made clear that this is something that can be done safely, consistent with our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\'ve made clear that it would actually enhance the national security of the United States to pursue this approach.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, it\'s going to be up to Congress to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re willing to enjoy the benefits of the outline that we have put forward.\xc2\xa0 Are they going to put forward their own plan?\xc2\xa0 There really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much of a discussion about that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a congressional plan to try to achieve these goals.\xc2\xa0 After all, we know there are a lot of Republicans who are running for President who are saying that they would make foreign policy decisions based on the advice they get from our military leadership, consistent with the need to cut government and cut wasteful government spending, and to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything to make America strong, and to protect our national security.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re making decisions based on that criteria, Congress would implement this plan today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 In the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba, my understanding is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not planning to visit the base -- either the soldiers or the prison.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 It was a little vague in some earlier conversations.\xc2\xa0 And was it considered and dismissed, or was it just never seen as a possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the details yet on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cuba.\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect that the President will go to the base at Guantanamo Bay, but let me check on that for you and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can confirm that in advance of a more full schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President seemed pretty frustrated today.\xc2\xa0 He talked for a long time about his plan that he\xe2\x80\x99s sending to Congress to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 He talked about the number of hours he spent working on this, and how many calls he has fielded with complaints from allies.\xc2\xa0 And it was obviously a major promise of his campaign.\xc2\xa0 He is now in the final year in office, and he basically acknowledged the impossible politics -- and you referenced it earlier -- no members of Congress want these prisoners in their districts or states.\xc2\xa0 So I wondered if you could just give us a sense of -- get us into his head a little bit about how he feels.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got 10 months left, and this is still an issue that he does not seem to be able to get rid of.\xc2\xa0 And sort of how he\xe2\x80\x99s looking at this now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way the President sees this is he sees it as an opportunity that he has to prevent a problem that was passed on to him from being passed on to the next President.\xc2\xa0 And he takes that approach not knowing who the next President is going to be. \xc2\xa0His view is that the interests of the United States would not be enhanced by passing this problem on to either a Democrat or a Republican in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And the President has acknowledged that the politics of this are tough and that there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity, given that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more elections to run, Vice President Biden doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any more elections to run, and that means they have some clarity of judgment that they can use here to do the right thing for the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, in a lot of ways, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for from Congress is, even if there is a reluctance on the part of some members of Congress or many Republicans -- many members of Congress -- from cooperating with the administration on this, the least they could do is actually just remove the obstructions.\xc2\xa0 Just get out of the way so the people who are actually trying to act in the best interest of the American people can do their job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s in some ways what the President is seeking.\xc2\xa0 If Congress feels like they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be involved in this effort, as I mentioned, there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of good reason for them to want to be involved in it -- it would enhance our national security and it would save taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 But if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they can just remove the obstructions and allow the United States -- to allow the President of the United States, his national security team, and our uniformed leaders in the military take the steps that we believe are necessary to enhance our national security.\xc2\xa0 We could do all that, save taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 That would be the right thing to do, and the President is hopeful that he can get that done before he leaves office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just back on Biden\xe2\x80\x99s comments for a moment on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be making the argument in 1992 that even though he had in the past as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee moved along Republican nominees and was willing to in a future administration, that there was something about the election year and being in the thick of a campaign that made it inappropriate to fill a vacancy either by the President or the Senate moving it.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder, can you explain to us what is different from June 1992 to February 2016?\xc2\xa0 Why is the standard different?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the biggest difference is there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a vacancy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a single thing that then-Senator Biden said that prevented the Senate fulfilling its constitutional obligations.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, I think, again, he made clear later in his speech that if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees \xe2\x80\x9cmay enjoy my support\xe2\x80\x9d as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.\xc2\xa0 Justice Kennedy was confirmed in an election year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So again, when it comes to evaluating the performance of members of the United States Senate, Vice President Biden has got a record that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty tough to beat.\xc2\xa0 And this is not a -- as I mentioned, we\xe2\x80\x99re simply asking the United States Senate in 2016 to do what Senator Biden did himself in 1987 and 1988, when he gave fair consideration to a nominee that was put forward by a President in the other party.\xc2\xa0 And Vice President Biden advanced the process so that that individual could be confirmed in an election year.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the Senate this time should do the same thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it was after that that he said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was going to be appropriate in the election year in which he was speaking.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it depends on which part of the remarks you take a look at.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable is there was not a vacancy.\xc2\xa0 There was nothing that Senator Biden said that prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean for that to be followed at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there in 1992; I was a senior in high school.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to assess with a lot of clarity exactly what the dynamics were.\xc2\xa0 But what is clear is that there was no vacancy at the time.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here that he said that prevented the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duty.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, in the same speech, then-Senator Biden made clear that he would be open to consultation with the White House that was controlled by the other party in fair consideration of the nominee that was put forward by the President of the other party.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re asking the Senate to do this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, could you just tell us a little more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the State Department tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we heard about that previously before Brett mentioned it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 So the President periodically has convened meetings with his national security team to discuss the ongoing effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The President will convene the meeting -- or the next meeting on Thursday at the State Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the last few months, the President has convened these meetings not just in the Situation Room but in other places.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall the President went to the Pentagon, I believe it was either in November or December of last year, to have this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know there was a discussion about our counter-ISIL campaign at NCTC last year.\xc2\xa0 And this week, the President will be convening the meeting at the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the State Department has been doing important work to try to reach this agreement -- or at least an understanding around a cessation of hostilities in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So given the primacy of the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done at the State Department right now, the President thought it made sense to convene the meeting over at the State Department this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Francesca, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Speaking of election year politics, I wanted to ask you about something the President said last week.\xc2\xa0 Several times in here you have indicated that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t endorse in the Democratic primary, and the White House Chief of Staff even said last month that he\xe2\x80\x99ll see who the nominee is at the end of that primary process, that\xe2\x80\x99s not our job, and then he\xe2\x80\x99ll decide.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks during his press conference seem to suggest that he could endorse a Democratic candidate in the race.\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately, I will probably have an opinion on it based both on being a candidate of hope and change and on a President who has got some nicks and cuts and bruises from getting stuff done over the last seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s changed recently that the President is now suggesting that he could actually endorse in this primary?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think if you go back and take a look at the way that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described the situation is that we don\'t currently have a plan for the President to make public his preference in the Democratic presidential nomination process.\xc2\xa0 The President will fill out a ballot and vote absentee in Illinois.\xc2\xa0 The Illinois primary is March 15th.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s got to make a decision pretty soon, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so the real question is just whether or not we\'re going to make that public.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now our plan is not to make that public.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out the possibility that we may decide to make that public at some point in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for your clarification.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
