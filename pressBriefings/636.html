MSK<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Hey, everybody, I have with me a special guest star, Evan Medeiros, who\xe2\x80\x99s our Senior Director for Asian Affairs at the NSC.\xc2\xa0 He can take some additional questions on the China bilat.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll just start by giving a brief readout of last night\xe2\x80\x99s dinner and then the bilat today, and then we\'ll take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst of all, the dinner last night focused on the subject of Syria.\xc2\xa0 As you saw, it went very late.\xc2\xa0 At the dinner each of the leaders was able to express their perspective on the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And the President found it to be a very broad and substantive discussion characterized by I think the seriousness with which people take the issue of chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs for the President, he once again underscored the very high confidence that we have that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 He reinforced the importance of upholding international norms to which all of the nations here are party to through the Chemical Weapons Convention.\xc2\xa0 He noted the importance of continuing to work through the U.N., but also the paralysis that has existed in the Security Council on the issue of Syria, and therefore, underscored the importance of ensuring that there is enforcement of a norm that is so fundamental to global peace and security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBeyond that, there was also discussion on the importance of a broader political resolution to the challenge in Syria through the Geneva II process.\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve said repeatedly, our military action is limited and focused on the issue of chemical weapons; it is not intended to resolve the underlying political crisis within Syria.\xc2\xa0 That is an issue that we seek to address through the Geneva II track.\xc2\xa0 And so the President was able to reinforce that message again last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think we updated you last night that he spoke with -- met with President Dilma Rousseff in between the G20 session and the dinner.\xc2\xa0 He also met with two other leaders on the margins of the dinner last night -- President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico and Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith President Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto, as with President Rousseff, President Obama underscored that we\'ll continue to work with the governments of Brazil and Mexico to address concerns that they have about the disclosures that have been made regarding the NSA. This is an ongoing process that we\'ll work through with the Brazilian and Mexican governments.\xc2\xa0 Of course, we also have a very strong bilateral relationship with each of those countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to Mexico, we continue to work together on economic and security issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President, of course, continues to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, which is profoundly in the interest of the United States and the American people, but also, of course, includes respect for the very deep familial ties between so many Americans and Mexicans as well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPrime Minister Erdogan and the President focused on the subject of Syria.\xc2\xa0 As you\'ve seen, Turkey has been a very strong supporter for the notion that the Assad regime must be held accountable for its use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, we\'ve coordinated very closely with Turkey in our support for the opposition within Syria, and we\'ll continue to do so going forward. So they had a good discussion on Syria, and we feel quite aligned with Turkey in our approach to the issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMoving to China today, the two leaders were able to build on the relationship that they forged at Sunnylands in addressing a very comprehensive agenda, noting that, of course, as you heard the President say, we\'re going to cooperate on issues of common interest but be very clear about our differences as well.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just briefly go through the issues they discussed.\xc2\xa0 And Evan can take any questions you have in greater depth.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey discussed the issue of North Korea.\xc2\xa0 China has been a cooperative partner in underscoring the importance of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve worked closely with them since the Sunnylands summit as we\'ve sought to pressure North Korea to enforce existing sanctions, and also make clear that we\'re open to a dialogue provided that North Korea meets its obligations with respect to denuclearization.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey discussed the global economy.\xc2\xa0 I think there\'s a shared view that we need to continue to promote growth and job creation. And the U.S. economy and the Chinese economy, as the two largest in the world, are fundamental to that effort.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President raised a number of the issues that we\'ve had concerns with in terms of China -- for instance, the need for greater reform of state-owned enterprises, our continued concerns about intellectual property rights.\xc2\xa0 There was a discussion of cyber.\xc2\xa0 And once again the President underscored that we view this not simply through a security prism, but what we\'re focused on is concerns about the potential theft of trade secrets emanating from China.\xc2\xa0 And the two leaders agreed that the cyber working group that was established at Sunnylands should continue to address those issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey also touched on the issue of climate change.\xc2\xa0 We, of course, reached an important agreement with China to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons -- HFCs -- in Sunnylands.\xc2\xa0 And today, they agreed to move forward under the basis of the Montreal Protocol to phase out HFCs and to work to make progress on a multilateral basis.\xc2\xa0 President Obama also underscored that with his new Climate Action Plan there\'s an even greater opportunity for the U.S. and China to work together in support of an international effort and accord on combating climate change, given the necessity of China playing a role in any potential global solution to the challenge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey also touched on issues related to the upcoming East Asia Summit.\xc2\xa0 I\'d just note the issue of maritime security.\xc2\xa0 The President reinforced his position that we want to see maritime disputes settled through cooperation, not through coercion.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the South China Sea, that includes the importance of negotiating a code of conduct between ASEAN and China.\xc2\xa0 With respect to the Senkakus, we reinforced the importance of there being diplomacy and dialogue to resolve the issue, not any efforts made at coercion.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then they addressed the issue of Syria.\xc2\xa0 Of course, that had been discussed the night before, but, again, the President reinforced the importance of upholding fundamental international norms that are important not just to the United States, but to China and the entire world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously had a difference with China on this issue.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I think the President reinforced the importance of taking action in the face of the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s use of chemical weapons, and also agreed that we would continue to cooperate through the Geneva II process on the political track.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can you tell us if you\'re planning to seek any kind of resolution on Syria of any sort today?\xc2\xa0 And has the NSA issues that came up with Brazil, Mexico -- has that complicated your efforts to bring people together on that?\xc2\xa0 And also, do you have any reaction to the Russians trying to talk to Boehner and Reid about Syria?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the issue of Syria, generally, here at the at summit, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s been any interconnection with the NSA issues.\xc2\xa0 These are very particular concerns that the Brazilian and Mexican governments have irrespective of what else is on our bilateral agenda.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re related to recent disclosures in the Brazilian and Mexican media, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work it through intelligence and diplomatic channels.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the summit, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is expressions of support and strong statements from those countries that believe that chemical weapons are prohibited under international law, and that there needs to be a response when there\xe2\x80\x99s an attack like we saw on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect every country here to agree with that position, starting with the fact that Russia has repeatedly refused to hold the Assad regime accountable for any of its actions over the course of the last few years.\xc2\xa0 But we do believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong number of U.S. allies and international partners who are supportive of the notion that there needs to be an international response that holds the Assad regime accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think at the dinner last night there was broad agreement that chemical weapons were used.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a question that\xe2\x80\x99s in doubt.\xc2\xa0 We also, frankly, believe that a majority of these countries here accept the basic facts that the Assad regime is responsible for the use of those chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, so what we\xe2\x80\x99ll look for today and coming out of the summit is for countries to step forward and make clear that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, that the Assad regime is responsible, and that there needs to be an international response that enforces the norm that prohibits the use of chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Boehner and Reid?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just say that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly seen is Russia refusing to take action to hold the Assad regime accountable and seeking to work through different processes to avoid the core issues.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t have an endless process at the U.N. Security Council that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead to anything.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that the Russians have anything to add to the debate in the United States given that we know where Russia stands on this issue.\xc2\xa0 They have continually supported Assad no matter what the facts show, no matter what the regime does.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- on the issue of chemical weapons, we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have Russian cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We do, however, believe that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to work with Russia through the Geneva II process.\xc2\xa0 And, again, the Russians have expressed concern about the direction of the conflict in Syria.\xc2\xa0 The way to resolve that is to bring the parties to a table to have a transition to a new government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the summit dinner last night -- which went on for quite a while -- what, if any, progress was made on either narrowing or resolving the differences, especially between -- the distance between President Obama and President Putin?\xc2\xa0 And was there any kind of pull-aside -- has there been any kind of pull-aside discussion, one-on-one, between President Obama and President Putin?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the second question -- no.\xc2\xa0 The only pull-asides that he had were the ones that I referenced, in addition to the bilats with China and Japan, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President did note that this was a substantive debate that was respectful, that everybody was able to express their view.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think there is broad agreement here that chemical weapons were used and that that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant challenge for the international community.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, we believe a majority of the countries accept the basic premise that Assad was responsible, so therefore he and his regime are the accountable actors in this instance.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect President Putin to move to that view given what he\xe2\x80\x99s expressed not just in recent days, but throughout the conflict in Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere is a question of the role of the U.N.\xc2\xa0 Many countries, of course, prefer that action is taken through the U.N. Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is the U.N. Security Council has been completely unable to act on Syria.\xc2\xa0 So I think the point that the President expressed is that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work through the United Nations on many aspects of our Syria policy, including the humanitarian relief that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been a leader on, including the Geneva II process that involves the U.N., and on the issue of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. inspectors will be reporting their findings; that will add more information to the record as to what happened on August 21st.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re also open to addressing the issue of chemical weapons through the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But we just don\xe2\x80\x99t see a likelihood that that will lead anywhere.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to create the broadest possible political and diplomatic support for the notion that an international norm has been violated, that a response is merited, and that the Assad regime has to be held accountable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is it also fair to say that at the dinner the President did not achieve a consensus among the leaders on the need for military action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President ever anticipated that we\xe2\x80\x99d achieve consensus on military action if Russia, for instance, is at the table.\xc2\xa0 So I think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or a majority of leaders?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let other countries characterize their view -- the goal is to speak to the broadest number of countries that can be supportive of a strong international response.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. has made clear that that would be a military response from the United States as we pursue a Congressional authorization.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe believe that there are a majority of countries here who understand the importance of the issue, understand who is accountable for the use of chemical weapons, and appreciate that there needs to be international response.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify a little bit on China?\xc2\xa0 Because I know neither leader spoke about Syria at the top.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to catch up with what you were saying.\xc2\xa0 It sounded like they did talk about it and the President did make the case, but could you go over that again?\xc2\xa0 And are you expecting that there would be some kind of a G20 statement on Syria before we go home?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us the outlines of what it would say, and any kind of count besides of Australia and France of who is now saying --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On the China question, they touched on Syria.\xc2\xa0 It was not a significant portion of the discussion, frankly, in part because it was addressed at the dinner last night.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is China, too, has been unwilling to support action through the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 But to be candid, this is one of those issues where Russia really is in the lead in terms of its support for the Assad regime.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think it has not been the principal issue in the U.S.-China relationship by any measure.\xc2\xa0 For instance, North Korea was a much more extended discussion today given our close cooperation on that issue.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe would not contemplate having a G20 communiqu\xc3\xa9 statement on Syria because this is an international organization that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on economic issues, unlike the G8, where you bring in political and security issues.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a not a precedent we\xe2\x80\x99re looking to set to bring in political and security issues to the kind of working sessions and communiqu\xc3\xa9 at the G20.<br/>\n\tWhat we would look for today is the question you asked, which is which of those countries will express support for the fundamental importance of enforcing the international norm against the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for other countries, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll speak for themselves today, but we believe that there is a solid number of U.S. allies and partners who are supportive of that notion, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with them throughout today.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that the U.S. will be able to read out for us at the end of G20 who those groups are, or are we just going to scurry around and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\'ll have a better sense at the end of the day.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll let the sessions conclude first.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, speaking of Geneva II, is there any progress towards talks or momentum in that direction?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why do you believe that that is still a viable path forward?\xc2\xa0 And a lot of these countries that you\'re seeking support from have said -- suggested they might be supportive of that, but they\'re waiting to see what Congress does.\xc2\xa0 So has the President\'s decision to go to Congress made it more difficult to get other countries on board?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 At the end of the day I think the President\'s decision to go to Congress will strengthen our ability to build international support because people will see that the President is acting with the backing of the U.S. Congress.\xc2\xa0 And that inherently puts him in a stronger position internationally and it also grounds what we\'re doing in a very firm legitimacy at home.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Geneva II, I think, frankly, all the discussion around the use of chemical weapons has actually only heightened the focus on Geneva II, because what we\'ve seen on August 21st, no matter how you look at it, was an outrageous use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 We\'re focused on enforcing the prohibition against the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 But, clearly, it also is a further destabilizing factor in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that countries are concerned about the direction of the conflict, to the extent that countries are concerned about the potential of U.S. military action -- and I\'m thinking of Russia here -- I think that further incentivizes solving the underlying problem, which is Syria\'s civil war and the continuing brutality of the Assad regime and the risk that an ongoing civil war provides safe haven for extremism over time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe should see a reinvestment in the Geneva process as a way to get at that underlying problem.\xc2\xa0 And I think you actually sense a greater deal of urgency around that solution, given what\'s happened in the last couple of weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any chance the ban on Russian adoptions will be brought up at any time during the President\'s time here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware that we brought it up to date.\xc2\xa0 I can check.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is, of course, this is an issue that is very important to many American families, so it\'s one we regularly raise with Russia.\xc2\xa0 But since we haven\'t had a bilateral meeting, I\'m not aware that that\'s come up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, you stressed that in the bilateral with China that North Korea was a major issue talked about.\xc2\xa0 Was there any concern expressed about the way that the international community responds to Syria could have some sort of example for either emboldening or helping to curtail the North Korea regime?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think we\'ve made clear that if you essentially undermined the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons, that doesn\'t just embolden Assad, it emboldens other dictators, other regimes, potentially terrorist groups to feel like these weapons can be used with impunity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNorth Korea, of course, is another country that has stockpiles of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And the last thing we want to do is send a signal that these weapons are fair game, that they\'re being reintroduced into the 21st century battlefield.\xc2\xa0 That would only pose a greater threat to South Korea and to the American servicemembers there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut in the bilateral itself, there was not that direct connection drawn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About an economic issue, how did President Obama explain about the tapering of QE?\xc2\xa0 And was there any quantitative easing?\xc2\xa0 And was there any complaints or concerns expressed by emerging market countries?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that this has been an issue discussed at the G20 broadly.\xc2\xa0 In the bilateral meeting, I will tell you that this is not a source of tension between the United States and China in any significant way.\xc2\xa0 I think we remain committed to growth.\xc2\xa0 And the important thing for China and the world economy is a growing American economy.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to take steps that we can in the short and medium term to promote growth even as we are dealing with our deficits.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMore generally, what we\'ve said is that emerging economies can\'t simply look to the United States for demand; that part of having a balanced, sustainable path to growth is going to have to include a greater demand generated from within emerging economies.\xc2\xa0 In fact, China is aiming to do that in some of their economic reforms.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that\'s a trend that other emerging economies should take, because while the U.S. economy can be an engine for global growth, it can\'t be the only source. And that\'s been the focus of the President\'s comments at the G20.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President describe last night at the dinner what kind of military response he was thinking of?\xc2\xa0 Does he still call it a \xe2\x80\x9cshot across Syria\'s bow\xe2\x80\x9d?\xc2\xa0 Is it true that he has asked for a much more aggressive list of targets of chemical weapons, not just -- of facilities that might support chemical weapons use?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President said here is the same thing he said at home, which is that this would be a limited military action, would not involve U.S. boots on the ground, it would not be open-ended.\xc2\xa0 It would not have the aim of accomplishing regime change through military force.\xc2\xa0 What we want to do is to deter the further use of chemical weapons, to degrade the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities as it relates to chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad spectrum of military options available to the President to accomplish those goals.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn the particular reports you reference, I think it would be an overstatement to suggest that we are changing the nature of this mission through the process of the debate on Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve always made very clear what our goals are.\xc2\xa0 And the military will put forward options that best achieve those goals. But, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a limited and focused military intervention that the President has taken to Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cshot across the bow\xe2\x80\x9d still applies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, it still applies insofar as it references deterrence, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want to do.\xc2\xa0 We want to deter the further use of chemical weapons, given the risk it poses to the Syrian people but also to the broader international prohibition on chemical weapons.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can the U.S. do a strike without any additional funds from Congress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Without what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any additional funds from Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think the Pentagon has spoken to this, so they\xe2\x80\x99d be best to answer the question.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is, yes, that this is something that can be dealt with within the existing budget.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s been spoken to in testimony and that\'s probably the most complete source for this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would involve a reprogramming of funds, then, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s what the Pentagon can speak to better than me.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that it would involve any additional funding.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a cost estimate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, not that I have.\xc2\xa0 That would be for the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 What I would say is what we\'re contemplating is nowhere near the magnitude of what the -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a fraction of the magnitude of what Iraq and Afghanistan cost.\xc2\xa0 And even Libya, which was a more sustained intervention with a no-fly zone that was enforced.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, the limited nature of the strike applies to the cost as well as to the fact that there are no boots on the ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department said that Glyn Davies will travel to China and South Korea next week.\xc2\xa0 Any expected timeframe for the resumption of talks on denuclearization?\xc2\xa0 And also, Ben, I think this is the third summit meeting between President Obama and President Xi, and you were present most of the times.\xc2\xa0 How would you describe the personal relationship between the two Presidents and their chemistry?\xc2\xa0 Good chemistry between them, or no chemistry, or what?\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take the second question first.\xc2\xa0 Based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Xi at Sunnylands, when they had extensive and extended interactions, I\xe2\x80\x99d say they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very cordial, very professional relationship.\xc2\xa0 They spent quite a bit of time at Sunnylands talking about a broad range of issues, both domestic and international priorities, which allowed them to understand each other\xe2\x80\x99s perspectives on their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so I can say that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very professional relationship that allows them to talk very directly to one another in a constructive way that allows them to determine where we can best cooperate on the major regional and international challenges facing both countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn your first statement -- on your first question about Glyn Davies\xe2\x80\x99s travel, there is no expectation.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t support resumption of talks simply for the sake of a resumption of talks. Our policy on this issue is very, very clear that until North Korea demonstrates that it\xe2\x80\x99s serious about denuclearization, until it recommits to denuclearization, until it signals that it\xe2\x80\x99s serious about some kind of dialogue or negotiation process, we\xe2\x80\x99re really not interested in --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the U.S.-China cyber working group -- how has it progressed so far since its establishment?\xc2\xa0 Any protocols or agreement that have been achieved yet?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. MEDEIROS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been one meeting with the cyber working group so far.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working on setting up another one.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d say the first meeting was quite productive.\xc2\xa0 It was really about setting the agenda for what the cyber working group is going to work on.\xc2\xa0 The aim of this particular effort is to develop rules and norms that help guide the interactions of both countries and others, eventually, on issues related to cybersecurity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of Brazil, did the President and\xc2\xa0 President Rousseff talk about a state visit?\xc2\xa0 Was there any -- did she cancel?\xc2\xa0 Did she not cancel?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think that we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s an important signal of the progression in the U.S.-Brazil relationship for there to be a state visit.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific details of their discussion on that issue.\xc2\xa0 They were, frankly, really just talking one-on-one for most of the time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut my understanding is what the President made clear is that we have intelligence collection that is focused principally on national security threats like counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction that I think are broadly accepted as threats to the world.\xc2\xa0 But we respect the very strong views that Brazil has about its concerns related to the NSA disclosures and we want to address those concerns.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with them to provide information about what we do and don\xe2\x80\x99t do in terms of intelligence gathering, what type of understanding we can come to related to our intelligence gathering and the concerns that Brazil has expressed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we think we can work those issues through on a bilateral basis to try to address their concerns, but keep the relationship moving forward more broadly, because we cooperate on energy issues, economic issues, hemispheric issues with Brazil, and we want to see continued progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of other meetings about Syria, what kind of meetings have you had that haven\xe2\x80\x99t involved the President?\xc2\xa0 What kind of meetings has Susan Rice had?\xc2\xa0 How are those conversations progressing at those levels?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I had six hours of meetings here at the international filing center yesterday with members of the international press, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that many meetings with counterparts.\xc2\xa0 Susan I think has been speaking very regularly with her counterparts here at the G20.\xc2\xa0 I think she\'ll have some additional meetings today.\xc2\xa0 So we can get you the specifics on that.\xc2\xa0 But while the President has been in the summit sessions, Susan and other officials who are here have been able to talk on the margins with just about probably all the representatives -- representatives of all the countries here on Syria and other issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any conversations with members of Congress since he\xe2\x80\x99s been here about Syria?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, we updated you that he had spoken to five senators, a bipartisan group.\xc2\xa0 We didn\'t read out individual names.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, I think he was in meetings all day, so I\'m not aware that he made any calls yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll keep you updated if he makes any additional calls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has President Obama had any personal interaction with President Putin so far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of beyond participation in the multilateral summits.\xc2\xa0 They obviously greeted each other, but they didn\'t have a kind of pull-aside discussion that I\'m aware of at this point --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- U.S. military action, have they said that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, David Cameron -- when the President made his statement in the Rose Garden, I think David Cameron immediately said he supported President Obama\'s position.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know we\'ll have a more updated list by the end of the day, but right now is it France, Australia and the UK, and is that it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think we\'ve -- I know there\'s a lot of discussion on this from Washington.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll let other countries speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to start making lists here, because then you leave somebody off.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think what you see is -- I\'ll just speak generally about I think a number of our European allies understand the need for a response.\xc2\xa0 I think a number of Arab countries understand the need for a response.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been discussing this with countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE and Qatar.\xc2\xa0 Turkey, of course, has been outspoken on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re discussing this with our Asian allies here, too.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\'t want to start running a tally here because that risks speaking for another country that should speak for themselves, or leaving somebody off.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\'ll continue to look for what countries say throughout the day here and in the days to come while Secretary Kerry travels to meet some of his European and Arab counterparts.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, when you say that these countries understand the need for a response, does that mean that they support a military response by the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 And how is that support kind of taking shape?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think a number of countries support the notion that there needs to be a military response to what took place in Syria.\xc2\xa0 In terms of participation, we\'re not contemplating a military operation that necessitates a significant number of countries coming onboard, as we did in Libya where you had a no-fly zone that had to be enforced over time.\xc2\xa0 Some countries have indicated some interest in participation.\xc2\xa0 The French, of course, have been quite outspoken on this, for instance.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut we believe that even without participation it\'s important for countries to speak up for the international norm prohibiting these chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And so we can look for that type of political and diplomatic support for our efforts, and that\'s what we\'re going to continue to do going forward.\xc2\xa0 We still, of course, want to see an authorization from Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think as the U.N. process goes forward, as the U.N. inspectors report back their findings, that may inform the decision-making of additional countries.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is an evolving process.\xc2\xa0 But our goal is to seek support from the U.S. Congress, and to seek the broadest possible international support for the notion of a response, which, of course, we\'ve made clear is a military response.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s no illusion as to what the U.S. is contemplating.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:04 P.M.
