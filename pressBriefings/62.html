Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:18 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just do a quick statement at the top and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you all know, the President will travel to Flint, Michigan tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He will stop first at the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan to receive a briefing on the response of the crisis from federal officials and members of the Unified Command group.\xc2\xa0 The food bank has helped more than 300,000 people in the last year, and it has become a critical hub in the response to the crisis.\xc2\xa0 The facility coordinates the intake of basic supplies like water and food, and packages meals and hygienic products for distribution to the community.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will then take part in a neighborhood roundtable discussion, where he will hear from Flint residents dealing firsthand with the impact of the crisis.\xc2\xa0 The President will also deliver remarks to a crowd of about a thousand people at Northwestern High School, which is located in predominantly African American North Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the direction of President Obama, a wide variety of federal agencies have been on the front lines responding to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 FEMA has distributed more than 9 million liters of water and 50,000 water filters.\xc2\xa0 Medicaid coverage has been expanded to everyone under the age of 21 in Flint.\xc2\xa0 HHS has extended funding to expand capacity at Head Start centers and community health care centers in Flint.\xc2\xa0 The EPA has surged resources to significantly expand water testing and to offer addition technical advice as needed.\xc2\xa0 And agencies like SBA and HUD have stepped up their support to the community that\xe2\x80\x99s weathering a pretty significant economic fallout from the crisis as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the President noted in his letter last week to Mari Copeny, known around town as \xe2\x80\x9cLittle Miss Flint,\xe2\x80\x9d Flint residents need to know that when the cameras are gone, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s support for the state and local response efforts will continue.\xc2\xa0 And the President looks forward to meeting with Mari and her family while he is in Flint tomorrow, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith all of that \xe2\x80\x93-</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the governor?\xc2\xa0 Any meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that the President will have an opportunity to visit with the governor when he\xe2\x80\x99s in Flint.\xc2\xa0 As is customary, the governor was invited to greet the President on the tarmac when he arrives.\xc2\xa0 I also understand that the governor and the mayor are likely to be included in conversations with those who have been on the frontlines of the response -- this is the meeting at the food bank.\xc2\xa0 And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the President also has an opportunity to visit with both the governor and mayor outside the context of that larger meeting as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tDarlene, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the death of the U.S. Navy SEAL in Iraq, is there any reaction from the President to that, or expression of condolence?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell us when he was informed about that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, I can tell you that the President has been briefed on this incident, and everyone here at the White House, including the First Family, extends our condolences to the family of the servicemember that was killed today in northern Iraq.\xc2\xa0 This individual is the third U.S. servicemember killed in action since the beginning of Operation Inherent Resolve, and this servicemember\xe2\x80\x99s death reminds us of the risks our brave men and women in uniform face every single day.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Department of Defense has indicated that initial reports are that this servicemember died when ISIL terrorists penetrated a checkpoint that was manned by Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 Those terrorists, after breaking through the line, went on to attack a Peshmerga position, where this U.S. servicemember was advising our partners on the ground.\xc2\xa0 U.S. forces responded right away with airpower to stop the attack, and our Iraqi partners are engaging the remnants of those forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you mentioned, this is now the third death of a U.S. servicemember since troops went back to Iraq in 2014.\xc2\xa0 Is this death today any sort of an indication that U.S. forces are moving closer to the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq?\xc2\xa0 Are they getting closer to combat and danger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what is true is that Iraq and Syria are dangerous places.\xc2\xa0 And our men and women in uniform who are engaged in a mission to offer training, advice and assistance to Iraqi forces that are fighting for their own country, are doing dangerous work.\xc2\xa0 They are taking grave risks to protect our country and we owe them a deep debt of gratitude.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s incident is a vivid reminder of the risks that our servicemembers are taking.\xc2\xa0 And some of them, three of them now, have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been clear, time and time again, exactly what their mission is.\xc2\xa0 That mission is to support Iraqi forces on the ground who are taking the fight to ISIL on the frontlines.\xc2\xa0 Iraqi forces must fight for their own country.\xc2\xa0 United States forces cannot be a substitute for those Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 The United States can use our military firepower.\xc2\xa0 And some of our special operators, in fact, are offering them important support, but that support comes in the form of offering advice and assistance.\xc2\xa0 And this is the core of our strategy, which is to build up the capacity of local forces to fight for their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have learned important lessons in the last decade.\xc2\xa0 We know that the United States will not be successful if it\'s U.S. troops acting essentially as a substitute for local forces, fighting for the security situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Iraqi security forces must be do that for themselves.\xc2\xa0 They can count on the support of the United States, they can count on the support of the 65 nations that have signed on to this coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 This is a fight that the United States is committed to because we under the consequences for our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, ultimately, it is Iraqi forces that are on the frontlines.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Iraqi forces that must fight for the security situation in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 My question on Flint was asked and answered.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Syria envoy said today that peace talks could resume if the ceasefire, such as it is, extends to Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 But the rebels launched a new assault on that city.\xc2\xa0 And so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, does that assault today prevent that from happening?\xc2\xa0 And where does the administration see any road to a diplomatic solution that does not require the kind of more aggressive response, U.S. response that some officials and allies in the Gulf have been calling for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roberta, it is true that the United States is concerned by the continued escalation of violence in and around Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 The security situation there, as bad as it\xe2\x80\x99s been for some time now, is deteriorating.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the cessation of hostilities is continuing to fray, particularly in some areas in and around Aleppo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s why the United States has been working so tenaciously through diplomatic channels to try to refresh the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And that involves working through the U.N.-led process to try to bring both sides to the table.\xc2\xa0 It involves working with our allies and directly with opposition forces to persuade them to live up to the commitments that they\'ve made in the context of cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also involves senior diplomatic officials in the U.S. government urging the Russian government to use the influence that they have with the Assad regime to persuade the Syrian government to abide by the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re working this from a variety of perspectives because it is central to resolving the situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We have to bring about a political transition in Syria in order to address all of the chaos there.\xc2\xa0 And that political transition will not occur while innocent people are getting massacred on the ground in Syria by the government.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we are trying to bring about the cessation of hostilities -- both to nurture continuing political talks, but also to allow for humanitarian relief supplies to be delivered.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made some important progress in that regard in just the last few weeks, but there are some areas that continue to be deprived of badly needed humanitarian supplies.\xc2\xa0 So there is a lot of work being done to try to refresh the cessation of hostilities all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, yesterday, Secretary Kerry said that a deal was close and that he signed today on a "regime of calm," I think was the term.\xc2\xa0 So did the rebel assault today prevent that from happening?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have an update for you in terms of an agreement that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been reached or announced at this point.\xc2\xa0 But I think this comments are an indication of just how deeply involved the United States Secretary of State and other U.S. diplomats have been in trying to broker the cessation of hostilities -- or a refreshing of a cessation of hostilities in those parts of the country where we\'ve seen it break down.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd Aleppo is certainly an area where we\'ve seen too much violence, and the continued escalation of that violence is troubling.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re working diligently through a variety of channels to persuade both sides to go back to observing the cessation of hostilities that had largely held until just a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think part of that, as I referred to this yesterday, we know that the Russian government has sufficient influence with the Assad regime to persuade them to abide by a cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 They were able to actually convince them to do that earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 But in just the last couple of weeks, we\'ve seen the cessation of hostilities begin to fray.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is we need the Russians to do again what they did once before, which is go back to the Assad regime and make clear that abiding by the cessation of hostilities is critical.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in this case today, my understanding is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not the Russians, it\xe2\x80\x99s the -- or the Assad regime, it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposition fighters that had launched the assault.\xc2\xa0 So I guess that\'s specifically what I was asking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that it\xe2\x80\x99s both sides that are responsible here.\xc2\xa0 And our strategy has been to work through the U.N.-led process to support the efforts of the U.N. envoy, Mr. de Mistura, as he tries to bring both sides to the table.\xc2\xa0 The United States has reached out directly to our allies that have influence with opposition figures.\xc2\xa0 And there has been some direct work that we\'ve done with opposition groups, as well, to persuade them to abide by the cessation of hostilities and come to the table for political talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'ve also worked through the Russians to persuade the Assad regime to live up to the commitments that they\'ve made, as well.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s our strategy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that provided a path to the successful implementation -- the largely successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re trying to get back to that point.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, when the ceasefire first was agreed upon, administration officials said that this would be a big test for Russia to see if they\'re serious about this and we\'re following through.\xc2\xa0 And at that time, the ceasefire was going better than expected.\xc2\xa0 It was just a short time into it.\xc2\xa0 So now that it\'s frayed and now that we\'re seeing too many serious violations by the Assad regime, and you keep mentioning that Russia should have this influence over them, would you say that Russia has passed this test, or not?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is fair to say that the Russians have previously been successful in persuading the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities, and it\'s clear they just need to do that again.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve done it once before, even earlier this year.\xc2\xa0 So they have the capacity to do it, and we\'re hopeful that they will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they deserve some of the blame for the fraying and that state that things are in now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as is clear from Roberta\'s line of questioning, both sides have contributed to the escalation of violence in and around Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 But look, when you have government forces that are under the command and control of the central government, and you have government forces that have much more firepower than opposition fighters on the ground, there\'s a significant responsibility that is borne by the government when it comes to living up to commitments that they have made in the context of a cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re concerned about the escalation of violence, and there has been violence carried out by both sides.\xc2\xa0 But we\'re going to go back to both sides and urge them to live up to the commitments that they previously made even just a couple of months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with Russia\'s level of cooperation so far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly believe that there is more that Russia can and should do.\xc2\xa0 Russia has succeeded in their efforts in the past to play an important role in the largely successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 The Russian government has the capacity to persuade the Assad regime to live up to their commitments, and we hope that they will use that capacity one more time to refresh the cessation of hostilities, particularly in the areas around Aleppo where it\'s been fraying with very bad consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the same day that the White House is honoring these great teachers, there\'s another large-scale sickout in Detroit.\xc2\xa0 How closely is the White House watching that situation?\xc2\xa0 And what are your thoughts on the situation there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the White House is obviously aware of the situation, but it\'s the Secretary of Education, John King, that\'s been in touch with state and local officials as the city of Detroit works through some significant financial problems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the point of honoring the National Teacher of the Year is to lift up the efforts of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t often get a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 But teachers that are showing up in classrooms on a daily basis are educating the next generation of Americans.\xc2\xa0 They\'re critical to the future of our country and to the success of our country.\xc2\xa0 And teachers have a job that\'s not glamorous, that\'s not high-paying, but I think many of them would tell you that it\'s enormously rewarding.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President believes that it\'s worth recognizing the important contribution that they\'re making to our country and to our country\'s future.\xc2\xa0 So as politicians are making choices about where to invest resources, the President believes that prioritizing the pay of teachers is a good place to start.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re really hearing Donald Trump and Ted Cruz going at it with these accusations and names flying --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because they\'ve been so well-behaved before?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, better-behaved, perhaps.\xc2\xa0 But in the past we talked a lot about the rhetoric in here and how it affects the country, how it affects either side.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve welcomed the robust debate, but the White House has been pretty serious in saying that the kind of rhetoric that has come from the Republican Party is bad for the country and bad for democracy.\xc2\xa0 But when you\'re seeing the rhetoric now directed at each other on the Republican side, are you seeing that as bad for the country and bad for democracy?\xc2\xa0 Or are you seeing that as good for Democrats and good for what you want to happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly does believe that living up to some standard of decorum when it comes to our political debates is valuable.\xc2\xa0 And the President had an opportunity to talk about this both in his State of the Union address but also in the speech that he delivered in Springfield, Illinois -- that leaders, regardless of -- sort of setting aside what office you\'re running for or even what party you represent, that running for elective office means that voters are prepared to entrust you with significant responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And with those responsibilities comes the need to elevate the public debate.\xc2\xa0 People who hold elective office are making important decisions that have an impact on citizens in their communities, and, in some cases, citizens across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when making the case publicly for why they should be entrusted with that responsibility, politicians have a responsibility to engage as much as possible in a debate about the issues, to lay out their priorities, to describe what it is that is motivating them to run for office in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And that is the kind of debate that makes for a vibrant democracy.\xc2\xa0 And the President has acknowledged that he has not always lived up to the high standard that he has set for himself.\xc2\xa0 But I think over the last eight or nine years, this President has done an extraordinary job of leading the kind of debate that, first of all, he can be proud of -- one that accurately reflects the kinds of values and priorities that promoted him to seek public office in the first place -- but it\'s also the kind of debate that engages the American public in the governing of our country.\xc2\xa0 And having campaigns that are filled with debates about the issues ultimately means that we have government that is more focused on the issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But surely you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admonish the opposing side\'s candidates from attacking each other.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House agree that the uglier things get, the better for Democrats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as you and I discussed at one point in the briefing last week, if you\'re looking for somebody to defend a Republican from the attacks of another Republican, you should probably ask somebody other than me.\xc2\xa0 But what\'s also true is that the individual candidates are going to have decide for themselves exactly what kind of campaign they want to run, and they\'ll have to make the case to the voters that what they\'re saying on the campaign trail -- or what that says about what kind of elective official they would be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or another way of asking:\xc2\xa0 Does the White House welcome the fierce attacks from one candidate to the other?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, individual candidates -- again, whether they\'re Democrats or Republicans -- are going to have to decide how they want to spend their time on the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly made his choices and has tried to live up to a very high standard that he has set for himself.\xc2\xa0 I think, by and large, the President has been enormously successful in meeting that standard -- not flawless, but enormously successful.\xc2\xa0 But other candidates will have to set their own standard for their campaign.\xc2\xa0 And I think voters will consider whether or not they\'ve lived up to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Senator Warren sent a letter to OMB Director Shaun Donovan, essentially pressuring the administration to finish up work on the overtime rule.\xc2\xa0 So I was wondering if you guys have an update on where the process stands in finalizing that rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update for you in terms of where that stands.\xc2\xa0 I know that\'s something that\'s being considered by OMB right now.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have an update for you in terms of when that review is likely to be completed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if you\'ve read the letter.\xc2\xa0 But she --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the letter.\xc2\xa0 You can describe it to me if you want, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, she was saying that the comments -- she expressed concern that the administration might weigh comments from lobbyists and those type of folks over comments from workers.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering if you can shed some light on how the administration is considering the comments from the public in finalizing the rule.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has been very clear about what his economic strategy is, and that is to ensure that our economy is growing from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the most -- that\'s the way that we can ensure that we have sustained economic growth over the long term.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are a variety of ways to examine whether or not the President has lived up to that kind of commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk one example.\xc2\xa0 We can do the conflict-of-interest rule.\xc2\xa0 This is a rule that would require financial planners who are offering retirement advice to do so with the best interests of their customers in mind.\xc2\xa0 We saw the financial industry unleash a significant lobbying campaign to try to water down that rule, and we rebuffed their efforts to do so.\xc2\xa0 We succeeded in moving forward with a rule that is certainly fair to financial planners.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s placing too high of a burden on them to suggest that they need to put their customers\xe2\x80\x99 interests ahead of their own financial interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that was a subject of intense debate, and this administration clearly came down on the side of working families who were trying to save for retirement.\xc2\xa0 I think the same could be said of -- at least a similar story could be told when it comes to implementing Wall Street reform; that implementing regulations as a result of Wall Street reform was the source of significant conflict between Wall Street lobbyists and a Democratic administration that\'s committed to fighting for working families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think by just about any measure, time and time again, as Wall Street reform got implemented, we were faithful to the commitment that this President made to make sure that taxpayers would not be on the hook for bailing out big banks when they made risky bets, and to make sure that middle-class families had an independent representative in Washington who was looking out for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think when it comes to this administration\xe2\x80\x99s track record of rebuffing the efforts of lobbyists and staying true to the commitments that have been made by this President to working families, our batting average is quite high.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.N. Human Rights Office said today that they\'re considering filing a complaint over the Flint water contamination crisis.\xc2\xa0 They said it raises human rights issues that this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened in a predominantly white neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of this development?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any reaction to it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of -- there are at least a couple of independent investigations that are ongoing right now, taking a look at what contributed to this crisis.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ve refrained from talking at much length about accountability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere have been a couple of findings that have already been released by people, like the Michigan attorney general and the independent blue-ribbon commission that was established by the Michigan governor, who did raise concerns about the conduct of state regulators.\xc2\xa0 But the independent investigations are ongoing, and so I think it would be premature for me to talk a whole lot about the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of accountability in this instance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In general, is the President concerned that this happened in a poorer community and that that might have contributed to the problem?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again -- look, I think the President is concerned that there was a failure on the part of government officials to ensure that the people of Flint were protected.\xc2\xa0 And there is a lot of work that\'s gone into determining exactly how and why that happened.\xc2\xa0 That work is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 But I think the fact that something like this happened in a community that is so economically disadvantaged is something that troubles the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could go back to Trump for just one quick moment.\xc2\xa0 The President said yesterday he doesn\'t think Trump is equipped to handle the challenges of this office, the presidency.\xc2\xa0 What exactly did he mean by that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has himself said before that he does not expect that the American people are likely to choose him to be the next President.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President was merely repeating that belief.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same thing, though, really.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not smart enough or doesn\'t have the capacity to deal with the challenges of the office.\xc2\xa0 That\'s different from saying I don\'t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get elected.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President is referring to the judgment that ultimately the American people will have to make.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of elaborating on his comments in the television interview yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let him do that if he chooses to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tOlivier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The President has now given the green light for the U.S. deployment to Syria to grow to about 500 special operators.\xc2\xa0 At what point does that deployment in Syria meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s definition of enduring offensive combat operations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Olivier, we\xe2\x80\x99ve used that phrase to describe the kind of military strategy that was employed in the context of the first invasion of Iraq, back in 2003.\xc2\xa0 And I think any impartial evaluation of the strategy that President Obama has employed to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL would reveal that our strategy is a lot different.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne way you can take a look at that is that when President Obama took office, there were 144,000 U.S. servicemembers on the ground in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The number now on the ground in Iraq is 4,000 or 5,000 -- a small fraction of the footprint that was ordered by the previous President in the context of the invasion of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur strategy is predicated on building the capacity of local forces on the ground to fight for their own country.\xc2\xa0 The situation in Syria is obviously somewhat more challenging because we do not have a central government with whom we can partner.\xc2\xa0 So the United States has been working with our coalition partners to build up the capacity of Syrian forces on the ground, and these often are forces that are drawn largely from the countryside, but have proved to be effective in taking the fight to ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, their effectiveness has been greatly enhanced by U.S. servicemembers who have offered them some advice and assistance on the ground.\xc2\xa0 Our coalition partners have been involved in the effort to train some of these fighters, and these fighters have been backed by airstrikes that have made it easier for them to operate effectively on the ground against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there is a lot that the United States can do to support these Syrian fighters, but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s these Syrian fighters who are responsible for combatting ISIL and for providing for the security situation in their own part of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe point is, that is a very different mission than the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops on the ground who are responsible for seeking out and directly engaging the enemy.\xc2\xa0 That is not the mission of the much smaller number of forces on the ground in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my understanding is that this was never -- I mean, the definition -- the wording you have in your AUMF proposal implies time; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t imply scale, right?\xc2\xa0 "Enduring," to me, suggests that there\xe2\x80\x99s some amount of time after which it has endured, it has lasted.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re answering with scale.\xc2\xa0 I understand that these are different missions.\xc2\xa0 I well remember the large-scale deployment in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious about -- so there\xe2\x80\x99s no time element?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no -- they could be in there years and it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t count as an enduring operation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the reference to "enduring" is a reference to the idea of an enduring presence on the ground -- the building of bases, a large physical presence on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why I do think this notion of the time commitment and the number of troops involved are not unrelated.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go back to Secretary Carter\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the formation of a NATO ground force that would be put in Balkan States and eventually Poland.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration seriously fear a Russian military intervention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Richard, what\xe2\x80\x99s true is that the President has long regarded NATO as a cornerstone of U.S. national security.\xc2\xa0 This is an alliance that is critical to our national security and is critical to our ability to advance our interests around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut NATO is, at its core, a defensive alliance.\xc2\xa0 NATO does not seek a provocation with Russia.\xc2\xa0 In fact, NATO seeks a cooperative relationship with Russia.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, Russia has undertaken a number of provocative acts, not the least of which is destabilizing the nation of Ukraine by repeatedly violating their territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but Ukraine is awfully close to a number of NATO countries.\xc2\xa0 And that has unsettled some members of our alliance.\xc2\xa0 And the President has laid out a number of proposals for how the United States can reassure our European allies in the face of these Russian provocations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the best example of this is actually the budget request that was included in the budget proposal that the administration put forward at the beginning of this year.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much discussion of it because Republicans, for the first time in more than 40 years, have refused to even have a hearing to discuss that proposal.\xc2\xa0 Apparently they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a discussion to discuss what the United States can and should do to reassure our European allies in the face of Russian provocation.\xc2\xa0 That is rather unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 So that irresponsible governing on the part of Republicans notwithstanding, President Obama has demonstrated a serious commitment to our European allies and our NATO alliance.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be additional detailed discussion of what else the United States can do when President Obama travels to Poland in July to meet with our NATO allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tRest assured, while our NATO allies may have some suggestions for what more the United States can do, the President will arrive with some additional suggestions about what our European allies can do.\xc2\xa0 The most important of those, I feel confident in saying, is that our European allies can meet the commitment that was made a couple of years ago at a previous NATO summit where each country committed to spending 2 percent of their GDP on national defense.\xc2\xa0 If every country that\xe2\x80\x99s a member of our alliance invests sufficiently in their own defense capabilities, that will have the effect of enhancing the national security of all of the nations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve collectively pledged to defend if they come under attack.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would you answer to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s perception that NATO is feeding into the Cold War minding with bringing troops, like concrete troops on the ground close to their borders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would answer that question by beginning where I began my last answer, which is making clear that NATO is the cornerstone of U.S. national security, but the NATO alliance is, at its core, a defensive one.\xc2\xa0 NATO seeks no provocation.\xc2\xa0 NATO is not seeking to antagonize any other country or any other alliance.\xc2\xa0 NATO was formed to ensure for the collective defense of the members of our alliance.\xc2\xa0 The President takes the U.S. commitments to that alliance quite seriously.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States has invested robustly in our defense capabilities.\xc2\xa0 The United States military works on a daily basis with our allies and partners in Europe to ensure that we can effectively operate together to confront shared threats.\xc2\xa0 And that interoperability, that ability to coordinate and share information is critical to our national security and critical to the national security of our allies.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is seeking to increase the resources that are dedicated to that effort.\xc2\xa0 We would welcome congressional attention and support for that commitment, because it is, after all, critical to the national security of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But it should not in any way signal to anybody a change in NATO\xe2\x80\x99s orientation of being a defensive alliance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very last question, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You referred to the Russian provocation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Is it still the idea of bringing troops and reassuring allies and having a defensive position, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it in anyway somehow an acknowledgement of the limits or even the inefficiency of the sanctions that have been put on Russia for the last two years without concrete results?\xc2\xa0 Even if you\xe2\x80\x99ll -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re going to come up with saying, oh, the ruble is going down, and the economy is slowing down.\xc2\xa0 Still, I mean, you need to send troops to reassure the neighbors of Russia to show that they can feel secure.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what is true is that the United States and our European allies have been able to coordinate effectively by imposing sanctions and imposing costs on Russia for their destabilizing activities inside of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the impact?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the impact has been negative when it comes to their economy.\xc2\xa0 I read a story in the New York Times either today or yesterday talking about the significant economic challenges that are facing Russia.\xc2\xa0 Now, a significant chunk of that economic weakness is a result of falling energy prices, but Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to respond -- or the ability of the Russian economy to adapt to those weaknesses in the energy sector have been constrained by these sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there have been costs that have been imposed on Russia.\xc2\xa0 Thus far, President Putin has been willing to bear those costs.\xc2\xa0 But as the New York Times points out, the cost to the Russian economy and the impact that it has on the Russian government is not insignificant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, yes, it has not -- I would acknowledge some part of your question, which is we have not yet seen the change in strategy that we\xe2\x80\x99d hope for.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s still time for President Putin to make that decision, to change his strategy in Ukraine to abide by the commitments that his country has made in the context of the Minsk talks.\xc2\xa0 And if he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to follow through on those commitments, President Obama has made clear literally from day one that the United States would be prepared to relax those sanctions as soon as Russia demonstrates a commitment to fulfilling the commitments that they made in the Minsk talks.\xc2\xa0 The President delivered that statement on the very day that the Minsk talks were -- or that the sanctions were imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what our strategy is thus far.\xc2\xa0 It has had an economic impact.\xc2\xa0 It has not yet resulted in the kind of strategic change on the ground that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see, but every day that goes by, the effect of the sanctions becomes tougher and more concentrated.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s President Putin here that has to make a decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd at the same time, yes, the United States is committed to ramping up our investment where necessary to demonstrate to our NATO allies that the attention of the United States has not lingered or wandered, and that the United States takes very seriously our investment and our commitment to the mutual defense of our NATO allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For all the wording about the Iraq mission, is the bottom line now that the American public should expect that there\xe2\x80\x99s a much higher likelihood of more casualties?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron, what\xe2\x80\x99s been true from the very beginning is that our servicemembers serving in Iraq are doing dangerous things.\xc2\xa0 They are putting themselves in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way for our national security.\xc2\xa0 Their ability to offer support, training, advice, and assistance to Iraqi forces on the ground in Iraq is critical to our strategy for degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to try to describe with precision exactly what their mission is.\xc2\xa0 Our men and women on the ground in Iraq do not have a combat mission, but they do have a dangerous mission to operate in a dangerous country, to support Iraqi forces who are taking the fight to ISIL in their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the number now is about 4,000 or 5,000 or so.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct, it\xe2\x80\x99s just over 4,000, I believe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many of those 4,000 are in this position of greater danger now as the tempo of the mission increases, or however you want to describe it -- now that things have changed in the last month or so and the pace of operations has picked up?\xc2\xa0 Is it a smaller -- a few hundred?\xc2\xa0 Or is it most of these 5,000, or 4,000 or so?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think for a detailed breakdown of this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 They can sort of give you the best assessment here.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I know to be true is that our forces are moving around quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 And so there are times where they will -- based on the new authority that the President has given, that the Commander-in-Chief has given to our troops, that some of them are now even operating down to the battalion level.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s dangerous work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis individual who unfortunately was killed today in northern Iraq was operating about two miles behind this line that was maintained by Iraqi forces just north of Mosul.\xc2\xa0 So I think that\'s a pretty good illustration of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 He was not on the front lines, but he was two miles way, and it turns out that being two miles away from the front lines between Iraqi forces and ISIL is a very dangerous place to be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a fairly intense battle that went on for some time -- airstrikes and so forth.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for U.S. airstrikes to be summoned on very short notice to try to provide for force protection.\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what happened here.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t describe -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quibble with that description that this was an intense situation.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not an uncommon one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I guess the concern, the perception is that, again, not trying to go back to the words the President may have uttered so many, many months ago that things have changed, but I think the public is just trying to understand exactly what our troops are doing there, and to what extent we are involved in combat, war, danger, high likelihood of fatalities, or this much more benign-sounding train-and-assist posture.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t mean to make it sound benign because it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xc2\xa0 What I am trying to do, though, is trying to be as precise as possible with you and the American public about what exactly our Commander-in-Chief has asked our servicemembers to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Carter earlier today described this death as a combat death.\xc2\xa0 That\'s accurate.\xc2\xa0 This was an individual who was not in a combat mission, but he was in a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 And his position came under attack. \xc2\xa0He was armed, trained, and prepared to defend himself.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, he was killed.\xc2\xa0 And he was killed in combat.\xc2\xa0 But that was not part of his mission.\xc2\xa0 His mission was specifically to offer advice and assistance to those Iraqi forces that were fighting for their own country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And all that is still in keeping with what the President said to the public about what we would be doing in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is precisely in line with the way that the President has described what our strategy is.\xc2\xa0 And I know that I keep going back to this, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way that I can think of to try to describe to you and to the American people exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe mission that our men and women in Iraq have right now is different than the mission that our servicemembers had during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 In 2003, there was a combat operation, forces on the ground -- U.S. forces on the ground -- that were given the mission to go and seek out and engage the enemy in combat.</p>\n<p>\n\tTens of thousands -- and at its peak, more than 100,000 -- U.S. forces were given that mission.\xc2\xa0 This mission is much different.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about 4,000 U.S. servicemembers.\xc2\xa0 Their mission is a dangerous one, but it is one that is predicated on building up the capacity of Iraqi forces to go and take the fight to ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think this might be a relevant point for me to highlight one other thing, which is that we have seen the performance of Iraqi security forces on the ground improve.\xc2\xa0 And despite the tragic news that we received earlier today, the last several days have been characterized by important progress that\'s been made by Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just describe a couple of them to you right now.\xc2\xa0 In just the last couple of days, Iraqi forces retook Bashir, in Kirkuk province.\xc2\xa0 These Iraqi -- or another contingent of Iraqi forces have succeeded in pushing ISIL out of Hit.\xc2\xa0 And another contingent, a separate contingent of Iraqi forces are continuing to apply pressure to ISIL terrorists in and around Haditha.\xc2\xa0 If Iraqi forces are successful in finally pushing ISIL out of the vicinity of Haditha, they will have effectively cleared ISIL terrorists out of the Euphrates River Valley.\xc2\xa0 This will be an important strategic gain.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of that progress that Iraqi forces made on the ground against ISIL fighters was only possible because of the important support that they have received from the United States and our coalition partners.\xc2\xa0 That came in the form of training before they even took the battlefield.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, that took the form of U.S. forces offering advice and assistance.\xc2\xa0 And in each of these cases, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, they were backed by U.S. and coalition military airpower.\xc2\xa0 So this is evidence, Ron, that we\'re making important progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it\xe2\x80\x99s also undeniable that the small number -- the relatively small number of U.S. servicemembers that are involved in these operations are not in combat, but they are in a dangerous place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President -- just to clarify, he says that Mosul will be recaptured by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that Iraqi forces are hoping to be successful enough that they could lay the conditions for the successful retaking of Mosul by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct, correct. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s -- and to be clear about that, there is still a lot of important work that needs to be done to lay the groundwork for that.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re a ways away from accomplishing that part.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify on the Flint situation, does the President think the water in Flint is now safe for the residents to drink?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, most importantly it\xe2\x80\x99s the EPA that has done extensive testing.\xc2\xa0 And what they have concluded is that filtered water in Flint is safe to drink.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the advice that they have shared with the public, and that\'s certainly the advice that the President believes the public should follow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Only the filtered water, not water straight out of the tap?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s my understanding that the situation on the ground in Flint is that -- what the EPA has communicated to the public in Flint is that filtered tap water in Flint is safe to drink and safe to use for other purposes like cooking and bathing and those other basic activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you give me the latest numbers on Gitmo detainees and any news that you might have about possible transfers coming out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any news to make about potential transfers at this point.\xc2\xa0 The most recent transfer was the transfer of nine individuals from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 That was a transfer that occurred shortly before the President traveled to Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 And I believe that that brought the number down below 90.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\'s in the low eighties now, but we can get you the precise number after the briefing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked you yesterday about the 28 pages of the congressional 9/11 report, and we just had a bit of a conversation about the fact that the President has a great deal of material that he reads on a daily basis, and certainly I think the American public understands that.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\'s still a curiosity, given the interest in those 28 pages and given its relevance, especially to such an important event in American history, that it would seem to me to be the President\'s responsibility to take a look at that.\xc2\xa0 He\'s not an incurious person.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just wondering, from that perspective, would he not then read the 28 pages?\xc2\xa0 Have you had a conversation with him about that?\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'s been reading the news reports as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been reading the news reports, and the President has been briefed on the contents of those 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 But as has been described by people like Director Brennan and by the leaders of the 9/11 Commission, that those 28 pages are essentially unvetted law enforcement and investigative materials.\xc2\xa0 So the President -- I think as is common for most people -- is mostly interested in the conclusions.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has looked at the 9/11 Commission report, and the 9/11 commissioners have indicated that they were able to review the 28 pages and follow up on the leads that were contained therein.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey conducted investigations and interviews -- not just in the United States, but even overseas -- to ensure they were running down the leads that were presented in those 28 pages.\xc2\xa0 And the conclusion that they reached is that even after conducting those interviews, and even after following up on the leads that were included there, that they did not find any evidence that the Saudi government as an institution had been supportive of the 9/11 terrorists.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is he not curious to read them for himself?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President basically feels he has sufficient information about what\'s included in the 28 pages, based on the briefings that he has received and based on the conclusions that were reached by the 9/11 Commission that has made those conclusions public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any update on the nomination of Rhett Jepson over at the Mint?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of the status of that specific nomination, but we can certainly look into it and get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and last one.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you again about the difference between combat and advising and assisting.\xc2\xa0 I think, if I\'m understanding you correctly, if I were to put them side by side on a full screen, they\'re both in combat.\xc2\xa0 One has a combat mission; one does not.\xc2\xa0 Is that the best way I can describe the difference between what you\'re suggesting -- which is, previously American forces had a combat mission and were in combat, and now they\'re in a combat but they don\xe2\x80\x99t have combat mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way that I would describe it to you is that individuals who are in a train, advise and assist mission are equipped for combat.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve been trained for combat.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is, simply, they\'re in a dangerous place.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, they\'re just a couple of miles behind the front lines.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in this tragic situation in northern Iraq that transpired earlier today, you had an individual who was not in a combat mission come under withering attack from enemy forces.\xc2\xa0 He was in a combat situation.\xc2\xa0 He was prepared to deal with.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately, under a complex attack, he was killed.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s tragic.\xc2\xa0 And it is a testament to the bravery and courage and sacrifice not just of this individual, who gave his life for his country, but for the 4,000 other U.S. servicemembers who are operating every day in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They are not in a combat mission, but they are in a dangerous situation and they\'re in a dangerous place fighting for our country and fighting for our security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President does not make decisions about deploying them into those circumstances lightly.\xc2\xa0 The President has been conscientious about making sure that our strategy is sound.\xc2\xa0 And I just described to Ron exactly what impact these brave servicemembers are having in building up the capacity of local forces in Iraq to take the fight to ISIL in their own country.\xc2\xa0 So this is a strategy that involves our men and women in uniform, assuming greater personal risk.\xc2\xa0 They do that for our country, and we are indebted to them.\xc2\xa0 But this strategy has yielded important progress.\xc2\xa0 In Iraq alone, with the support of U.S. servicemembers, Iraqi forces have retaken about 40 percent of the populated areas that ISIL previously controlled.\xc2\xa0 That is notable progress.\xc2\xa0 That is making America safer.\xc2\xa0 That would not be possible without the bravery and heroism of American servicemembers.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what I have tried to do and what the President has tried to do is to be as precise as possible in describing to you and to the American people exactly what mission the Commander-in-Chief has asked our servicemembers to carry out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can follow really quickly on number -- 4,000 to 5,000 Americans, give or take.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a sense of how many Iraqi forces are fighting for their country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that, but I think the Department of Defense can give you some kind of -- at least a ballpark estimate of the number of Iraqi forces that we\'re working with.</p>\n<p>\n\tToluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Syria cessation, the Russian foreign minister said earlier today that we\'re hours away from a new ceasefire in Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering, does the White House -- does the U.S. government share that optimism about a potential new cessation?\xc2\xa0 And will the President be calling President Putin to talk about how to bring that about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of any phone call that is planned at this point.\xc2\xa0 If a phone call like that occurs, then we\'ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make about a deal that\'s been reached or a deal that\'s being prepared to an announcement.\xc2\xa0 If an agreement like that has been reached, then we\'ll obviously want to announce that in advance, as well, so people know that there\'s a ceasefire to abide by.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRight now, we\'re in the phase of working with the U.N. to try to bring both the opposition and the regime back in line with the commitments that they made in the context of a cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 When that was initially implemented, it was more successful than we previously expected.\xc2\xa0 But we have seen it start to fray in some areas, particularly in and around Aleppo.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re seeking to refresh our efforts in that region of the country.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made clear, both directly and through our partners and allies, that it\'s important for both the government and for opposition fighters to live up to their commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They said it was more successful than previously expected, and the President said that it lasted longer than he thought it would.\xc2\xa0 So what was the original goal?\xc2\xa0 Was the goal that during this five or six weeks that the President thought it would last, that a political transition would have been able to get solidified?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems like a short period of time to think that if the cessation is only going to last for a couple of weeks, that it will make a major difference --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a totally fair question.\xc2\xa0 There are two goals that we had in mind.\xc2\xa0 The first was the provision of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 While the fighting was raging, before the implementation of cessation of hostilities, there were communities that were essentially cut off from the outside world.\xc2\xa0 And that prevented the delivery of basic supplies, like food, water, medicine.\xc2\xa0 And in the context -- when the cessation of hostilities was implemented, we did see important progress made in terms of the delivery of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 And I have some statistics about that, if that\'s useful to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are about 57 humanitarian assistance convoys that have been mobilized by the Syrian Arab Red Crescent since February 14th.\xc2\xa0 That includes about 700 trucks delivering life-saving assistance to about 678,000 people 23 hard-to-reach and besieged locations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to that, the U.N. World Food Program conducted about 16 airdrops that delivered about 284 metric tons of food assistance to about 100,000 people in one particular community in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That was an airdrop that occurred at the end of April -- or there was a series of airdrops that occurred at the end of April.\xc2\xa0 So that is evidence that the cessation of hostilities did create space for that kind of humanitarian relief to be delivered.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second goal is that opposition figures had essentially said it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult for us to participate in any form of political negotiations while our constituents are being slaughtered by the government.\xc2\xa0 And the goal of the cessation of hostilities was to get both sides to hold their fire against each other, because the cessation of hostilities did not apply to extremist groups like Nusra or ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But if the cessation of hostilities could be successful in getting both sides to hold their fire, that might build in some momentum into political talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there were a series of political talks that were convened while the cessation of hostilities was in effect.\xc2\xa0 But there was a pause that was taken in those talks as we saw the cessation of hostilities begin to fray.\xc2\xa0 And so our hope is that by refreshing the cessation of hostilities in those areas where we saw fraying, we can give another boost to the ongoing political negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects that those political negotiations would be completed in just a couple of weeks, but we are hoping that those talks can build a little momentum so that they can make more progress than they have thus far in bringing about the political transition that everybody acknowledges is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one on the Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern that since ISIL was able to sort of break through this checkpoint and get two miles -- basically have a casualty two miles away, that the security forces may not be as effective as they should be in fighting on the frontlines?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I detailed to Ron, there are a number of areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress just in the last few days.\xc2\xa0 So we have seen the performance of Iraqi security forces improve dramatically in just the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 There are important reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the Iraqi security forces have gotten important equipment from the United States and our coalition partners; they\xe2\x80\x99ve essentially been resupplied.\xc2\xa0 The United States and our coalition partners have undertaken extensive training operations to enhance the fighting ability of Iraqi security forces.\xc2\xa0 And since the beginning of the campaign, the United States and our coalition partners have carried out about 12,000 airstrikes, I believe is the latest number.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of those airstrikes were conducted in support of operations on the ground, and those airstrikes have greatly enhanced the performance of Iraqi security forces on the ground.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a steady improvement, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that you have seen ISIL driven out of 40 percent of the populated territory that they previously controlled.\xc2\xa0 So we are pleased with the improvements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last 18 months or so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I will say the other thing that has been a welcome development is a more consistent commitment on the part of Iraqi security forces to be willing to defend their country.\xc2\xa0 And that was called into question when ISIL made their rapid advance across the Iraqi desert.\xc2\xa0 There was a sense that many Iraqi forces were not willing to fight for their country.\xc2\xa0 But the resilience and commitment of Iraqi security forces has also been enhanced.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s led to their improved performance.\xc2\xa0 It also has led to an improvement in terms of what their prospects are likely to be moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on Detroit.\xc2\xa0 Can you say if the White House supports the actions the teachers there are taking?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the Education Secretary has been the administration official most directly involved in encouraging both sides to resolve the situation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously when you have now two days in a row where school kids in Detroit are not going to school, that\xe2\x80\x99s a significant problem that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a broader economic impact.\xc2\xa0 The parents are going to have to stay home to take care of their kids who would otherwise be in school.\xc2\xa0 It raises some public-safety issues.\xc2\xa0 There are some parents who may not be able to stay home with their kids, and those kids are now operating or moving around unsupervised.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTo say nothing of the most important thing, which is these kids aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting educated, and that is a real problem, and one that the President is deeply concerned about.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is prepared to do whatever we can to encourage both sides to come to an agreement that can put teachers and, most importantly, students back in the classroom.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the administration urging the teachers to end their sickout?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re urging both teachers and local officials to do is to resolve their differences so that kids can get back to school.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is this a subject the President might mention in his teacher remarks today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point, but stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMegan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, an independent think tank, IHS, reported that the tempo and intensity of ISIS operations in Iraq and Syria has actually been increasing over the past three months.\xc2\xa0 Attack figures for the first quarter of 2016 were the highest since ISIS took Mosul in 2014.\xc2\xa0 The past quarter also saw the highest number of fatalities since the second quarter of 2015.\xc2\xa0 So how do you square those figures with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s argument and the argument that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been making that ISIS is on the retreat in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the study, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to directly rebut it.\xc2\xa0 But I would at least posit that some of those statistics are a direct result of ISIL encountering much greater pressure from Iraqi security forces than they have before.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that ISIL has lost control of 40 percent of the territory in populated areas that they used to previously control.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s because the Iraqi security forces on the ground are applying significant pressure to drive them out of those areas.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s at least part of the equation.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you if there\xe2\x80\x99s a more specific answer that we can give to help you understand those numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the assessment -- and I guess the assessment that ISIS is in retreat -- how often is that being assessed?\xc2\xa0 Will it be adjusted at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is getting regular updates from his military commanders that includes input from people who are on the ground, seeing firsthand exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s happening there.\xc2\xa0 The President meets every two or three weeks with his national security team to review the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made against ISIL, and the President regularly gets battlefield assessments -- not just in the context of those meetings, but in sometimes even in the context of the presidential daily briefing that he begins his day with.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re regularly looking at the situation on the ground and assessing the impact of the strategies and tactics that we have used to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut based on the 40 percent figure that I cited before, based on those areas around Bashir and Hit and Haditha, where we have seen Iraqi forces make progress just in the last few days, that continues to build our confidence in our ability to continue to pressure ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And when I say \xe2\x80\x9cour,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m using that word intentionally, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about the United States -- I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the Iraqi forces that are on the frontlines of this fight, and they\xe2\x80\x99re backed by the United States and our coalition partners that are committed to their success.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it a surprise to hear that -- for the President to hear that ISIS fighters were on the attack, got two miles beyond the frontlines, and killed this U.S. Navy SEAL?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the context of this incident is very tragic and it does underscore how dangerous the situation is there, and it underscores the risk that our servicemembers are taking to protect our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, I think there is always a danger of drawing minute-by-minute conclusions about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on the battlefield in the context of a long-term military campaign.\xc2\xa0 The President talked about this from the very beginning -- that there would be important progress that we would enjoy and there would be periods of setback.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true for the last almost two years now, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that will be true moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think recently there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying -- this terrible tragedy notwithstanding -- that we made important progress recently.\xc2\xa0 And we are hoping that by working with our coalition partners and by providing additional advice and assistance and additional equipment to Iraqi forces, we can help them build additional momentum and build additional pressure on ISIL terrorists in their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while the President is on the ground in Michigan, will he be addressing the Detroit teachers\xe2\x80\x99 concerns there at all?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll raise that issue with the governor when he speaks with the governor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if the President will raise this with the governor, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and get you a readout of their conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do one or two more.\xc2\xa0 Taka.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh.\xc2\xa0 North Korea announced its Workers\' Party congress will begin this Friday.\xc2\xa0 So do you expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll announce any new policy direction?\xc2\xa0 Also, do you also expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll conduct another nuclear test before its party congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point I would refrain from hazarding a guess or offering up any predictions about what the North Korean regime may do.\xc2\xa0 Their track record of provocative actions and destabilizing activities on the Korean Peninsula is lengthy.\xc2\xa0 And there has been a troubling, increasing frequency of those provocative acts just in the first few months of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States remains committed to working with the international community to further isolate North Korea in an attempt to persuade them to abandon those tactics.\xc2\xa0 The United States is certainly committed to the safety and security of our allies in South Korea and Japan.\xc2\xa0 And our commitment to our allies will not waver.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Japan, you say there is no update about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s trip to possible Hiroshima.\xc2\xa0 But just in case -- I wanted to ask the question today -- if the President is considering to make a speech when he goes to Japan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary when he travels to Japan.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly keep you posted if any stops are added beyond the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the G7 meeting there later this month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mrs. Obama is also going to Japan with the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that she is planning to accompany him on this trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 After the President\xe2\x80\x99s interviews yesterday on the Supreme Court, does the White House consider it a victory either if Merrick Garland -- if Chief Judge Merrick Garland is given a hearing?\xc2\xa0 Or barring that, as Senate Republicans seem to be wont to do, to make Republicans pay a political price for it in November?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jared, our goal here is to confirm Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 He is the most experienced nominee in terms of his 19 years on the federal bench than any other Supreme Court nominee in American history.\xc2\xa0 That experience I think is an indication that he is more than prepared to assume the significant responsibilities associated with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver his 19-year career, he has established a strong track record of interpreting the law and not using his position to advance a political agenda.\xc2\xa0 I think for all of the acrimonious charges and counter-charges that are traded back and forth between Democrats and Republicans, that principle I think is something that does enjoy bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>\n\tChief Judge Garland also enjoys bipartisan support, by the way.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s why many Republicans -- at least one high-profile Republican -- has acknowledged that he is a consensus nominee.\xc2\xa0 We just need to see Republicans actually do their job and step up to the plate and fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 And that is to give Chief Judge Garland a hearing and a vote.\xc2\xa0 After all, to deny him a hearing or a vote would be the first time that any Supreme Court nominee has been denied a hearing or a vote since 1875 -- 1875.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what Republicans are preparing to do and have begun to do is an unprecedented escalation of partisanship.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think the American people are pleased about that because the expectations, when it comes to the Supreme Court, is that constitutional responsibilities and a commitment to justice and fairness and equality all ahead of politics is what people want from their Congress.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not what they\'re getting from this set of Republicans in Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, as you so often remind us, you\'re not a spokesman for any those other entities, just for the White House.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you is, is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that barring hearings, votes, et cetera for Merrick Garland is, as you said, and I think you alluded to it in the answer, but I didn\'t really get an answer to my original question, which was:\xc2\xa0 If you\'re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s up to the American people, and they\'re not happy about it, is that the White House\xe2\x80\x99s essentially backup plan to say that making Republicans pay a political price for this, as you say, unprecedented, as the President has said unprecedented position -- is that what the White House is seeking to do?\xc2\xa0 It certainly seems that way given the President\xe2\x80\x99s stance on both official and political events.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no backup plan.\xc2\xa0 There is only one goal, and that\'s to confirm Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the reason that we\'re engaged in this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what is true is that there is ample public data out there that might lead one to conclude that if Republicans do refuse to do their job, that voters may have something to say about that.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the White House is agnostic as to whether voters should -- I mean, it can\'t be true that the White House is agnostic that voters should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t judge Republicans on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think whether or not we want it to be true, it is clear from that data that the American public -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about Democrats, I\xe2\x80\x99m not even just talking about independents -- there is ample data to indicate that Republican voters are uncomfortable with the position that Republican senators have taken to not do their job.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think some of that stems from the explanation that we\'ve heard from a lot of Republicans senators.\xc2\xa0 Republicans senators, when confronted with the fact that they have a constitutional obligation to uphold, have said that they\'re not going to do that because Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, has told them not to.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t even think Republicans think that\'s a good explanation.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think individual voters are going to have to decide for themselves how and whether they\'re going to hold their representatives to the United States Senate accountable to for their actions in the Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what is clear right now is that the position that Republican senators have taken in refusing to do their job puts them on the wrong side of this issue in the view of the vast majority of Americans in both parties.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we take your hesitation to embrace this as a political issue that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t be campaigning on this eventually when he gets more on the stump when there\xe2\x80\x99s a Democratic nominee?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to stand down and not take a position that this is an issue that voters should care about in the next few months?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I do anticipate that at some point this year, the President will be campaigning in support of Senate Democrats, including individual Senate Democratic -- including individual Democratic candidates for the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, this is entirely a relevant issue.\xc2\xa0 It certainly --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely relevant?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is an entirely relevant issue.\xc2\xa0 But individual voters are ultimately going to have to decide for themselves exactly whether or not this is going to affect which candidate they support.\xc2\xa0 If this does have an impact on their vote, Republican senators are in trouble.\xc2\xa0 Because again, the polls indicate that in many states even a majority of Republicans are concerned about this position that Republican senators have taken -- again, primarily because of the explanation.</p>\n<p>\n\tVoters in states all across the country didn\'t send their representatives in Congress to go and do what Mitch McConnell told them to do.\xc2\xa0 They sent their representatives to go there and fulfill their constitutional duty and represent the interests of their constituents.\xc2\xa0 And I think most people believe that their interests are best represented when the Supreme Court of the United States has the full complement of justices.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll right?\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:32 P.M.
