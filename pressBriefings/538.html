Brady Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:25 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions let me just mention that, as you know, this afternoon, the President will unveil his \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d initiative, taking action in partnership with foundations, businesses and others to make sure that every young man of color who is willing to work hard and lift himself up has an opportunity to get ahead and reach his full potential.</p>\n<p>Building on his year of action, this new initiative is another way the President will use his pen and his phone, involving both the private and public sectors, to expand opportunity for Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President will be joined at the event by a wide group of stakeholders who share our interest in helping put these boys and young men of color on a path to success, including foundation and business leaders, faith leaders, state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 Boys and young men of color, including several from the Becoming A Man program in Chicago, who the President has previously met with both in Chicago and hosted here at the White House, will also be attending today\xe2\x80\x99s event.\xc2\xa0 Before the event the President will meet with a group of the foundation and business leaders supportive of or participating in the initiative.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\'d also like to announce that on Thursday, April 10th, the President and First Lady will travel to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, to deliver remarks at a Civil Rights Summit to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Rights Act.\xc2\xa0 We will release more details when they become available.</p>\n<p>I will now take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the latest developments in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We have Russia scrambling jets near the border.\xc2\xa0 We have the Russians apparently harboring Yanukovych, and some gunmen taking over government offices in Crimea.\xc2\xa0 I wonder what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that is and if you\'re taking any steps in response to it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start broadly by saying that the United States welcomes the Ukrainian parliament\xe2\x80\x99s decision to establish a new government that can unite the Ukrainian people and restore order and stability to the country.\xc2\xa0 As the process moves forward, the United States, again, calls on all parties in Ukraine and in the region to support reconciliation and the country\xe2\x80\x99s return to political and economic health.\xc2\xa0 And we will work with the international community in building an economic assistance package based upon Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s achievements in crafting a unity government.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to pursue economic reforms and the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it will send a team to Ukraine in the coming days.</p>\n<p>We expect that the government will do its utmost to protect the security and human rights of all its citizens, including the rights of minorities, and to recommit to honor the state\xe2\x80\x99s international obligations in this interim period.\xc2\xa0 In this regard, we welcome today\xe2\x80\x99s statement from the government that the rights of all Ukrainians will be respected.</p>\n<p>We strongly support Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and sovereignty.\xc2\xa0 We expect other nations to do the same.\xc2\xa0 And so we are closely watching Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military exercises along the Ukrainian border, which they announced yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We expect Russia to be transparent about these activities and to avoid provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 We urge them not to take any steps that could be misinterpreted or lead to a miscalculation during a very delicate time.\xc2\xa0 It is important for all nations with an interest in a peaceful future for Ukraine to work together to support a Ukrainian government that fulfills the aspirations of its people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have there been any discussions between the White House and the Kremlin to get assurances about what that activity is at the border?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a specific conversation to read out.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Secretary of State has spoken with the Foreign Minister, Foreign Minister Lavrov, about the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a more detailed readout of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 That is the most recent conversation I\'m aware of at a high level with the Russian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And anything more on how specific you can be on what an economic package from the U.S. could be to supplement the IMF assistance?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First, the U.S., working with partners around the world, stands ready to support and provide support for Ukraine as it takes the necessary reforms to get back to economic stability.\xc2\xa0 I would note the broad support expressed at the G20 finance ministers meeting over the weekend for an international assistance program package centered on the IMF.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine needs both multilateral and bilateral support for a reform program, and the United States believes the IMF would provide the best foundation for economic advice and financing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We welcome news that the IMF will send a team to Ukraine in the coming days, as I mentioned, and the U.S., together with Europe and others, stands ready to supplement an IMF program to cushion the impact of reforms on low-income Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>When it comes to U.S. assistance, we are continuing to consider a range of options, Jim, including loan guarantees to support Ukraine economically.\xc2\xa0 The next step is for the new government to resume talks with the IMF.\xc2\xa0 And as the government engages the IMF, we will also begin taking steps in coordination with multilateral and bilateral partners as well as with the new government that could -- steps that could complement an IMF package.\xc2\xa0 But the first step here is for the new government to resume talks with the IMF.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question -- I wanted to ask you about Iranian sanctions.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, earlier this month, said that the U.S. would come down like a ton of bricks on countries that circumvent those.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s concern up on the Hill that some Chinese data -- Chinese government data that shows that their imports of Iranian crude has jumped 29 percent since November and that Indian imports have grown as well.\xc2\xa0 Is there concern about those transactions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Jim, is that the way that this is measured, as I understand it, is over a six-month period in terms of maintaining levels of imports and that that data -- those levels can fluctuate on any given month.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are watching this closely, in keeping with the expectation that we have that all nations will abide by their commitments under the sanctions regime.\xc2\xa0 But I would, on the matter of one month\xe2\x80\x99s export levels, caution that, as I understand it, the way this is viewed is over a longer period of time.</p>\n<p>Yes, Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So far in what the administration has observed with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military actions along the border, is Russia doing enough to be transparent about its military actions?\xc2\xa0 Can they already be characterized as provocative?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that we expect Russia to be transparent about these activities they announced yesterday and to avoid provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 That is an expectation we have and we are conveying because it is in Russia\'s interest and, of course, in the interest of the Ukrainian people that there not be provocations; that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity be maintained and its sovereignty be maintained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is also the case, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and others have said, that the aspirations the Ukrainian people have so clearly expressed to further integrate with Europe are not contradictory with maintaining historic cultural ties and economic ties to Russia.\xc2\xa0 It is also our view, as I said earlier, that it is very important that the Ukrainian government maintain a position in which it clearly promotes and defends the rights of all Ukrainian citizens, including minorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 We have made abundantly clear, I think Ambassador Rice and others have, that we expect Russia to be transparent in the way that it\xe2\x80\x99s handling these issues, and that it is not in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see further destabilization and certainly not in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s interest to see a return to violence of any kind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment thus far?\xc2\xa0 Is Russia being transparent enough in terms of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to evaluate that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Russia needs to be transparent.\xc2\xa0 We obviously are cognizant of the announcement yesterday and we are monitoring developments there.\xc2\xa0 The views that I expressed have been and are being expressed to Russian officials as well as others around the region.\xc2\xa0 And we again are focused on supporting the Ukrainian people; this is about their aspirations.\xc2\xa0 And our approach to this is built around the idea that Ukraine needs to maintain its independence, it needs to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereignty, and it needs to have a government that defends and respects the rights of all its citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about the visit announced this morning with Palestinian President Abbas -- what does the President want to accomplish during that meeting and what kind of message will he be sharing with Prime Minister Netanyahu on Monday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has been making a concerted effort, as you know, to assist Israel and the Palestinians as they make progress in their negotiations.\xc2\xa0 We have been working with the parties on a framework that would be the basis for negotiations moving forward.\xc2\xa0 The parties are talking about the core issues, including borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, mutual recognition, an end of conflict and an end of claims.\xc2\xa0 Those are the core issues that need to be resolved for a peace agreement to be reached.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas have already made courageous, difficult decisions, and that is a testament to their determination to try and resolve this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you know, the President launched this initiative during his trip to Jerusalem and the West Bank last March.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry and his team have been doing an excellent job and the President has made clear that he stands ready to work with the leaders to help them reach an agreement.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s visit as well as President Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s visit on March 17th will be important opportunities for the President to take stock of where we are and to work through the details with them.\xc2\xa0 So this is a step in the process and the President looks forward to both meetings.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly, on bitcoin, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how closely is the White House monitoring what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the virtual currency and its largest exchange, and does the White House have a position on it, one way or the other?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 For the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position on it, I would refer you to the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to get back to Russia, but just curious if you had anything to say about the Attorney General being hospitalized.\xc2\xa0 Has the President been made aware?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been made aware and I think the Department of Justice has put out a statement that as a precaution when he felt faint earlier today, he was taken to Washington MedStar Hospital Center to undergo further evaluation. And he is resting comfortably and in good condition.\xc2\xa0 He is alert and conversing with his doctors.\xc2\xa0 The President was notified and, of course, wishes him a speedy recovery.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And getting back to Russia, there are reports out of Russia that President Yanukovych still claims to be the President of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House view him as such, or has that ship sailed?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I have said earlier, and others, Mr. Yanukovych abdicated his responsibilities when he packed up and left the capital of his country, and he fled Kyiv and has only been seen once on videotape since Saturday.\xc2\xa0 Those actions undermine his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers in the parliament are fulfilling their obligation to the Ukrainian people by forming a government that can tackle the pressing economic and political issues facing the country until new presidential elections can be held.\xc2\xa0 Those elections are now expected on May 25th, in keeping with a call for early elections.</p>\n<p>So we support the efforts of the parliament to get the security situation under control and to ensure that the institutions of government are working.\xc2\xa0 We note that recent parliamentary votes have been won by overwhelming majorities that include members of Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s former party, and that includes the votes establishing the government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe believe that working within the boundaries of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s constitution and through its governmental institution is the most promising path towards the de-escalation of violence, an inclusive multiparty government, and early elections.</p>\n<p>So the facts on the ground demonstrate that Mr. Yanukovych created a void by, shortly after signing an agreement, in an orderly fashion, packing up his stuff and disappearing.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to claim you\xe2\x80\x99re leading a country when you abdicate your responsibilities and disappear.\xc2\xa0 So the parliament, in keeping with its responsibilities to the people, has been acting responsibly, voting on a number of issues and passing bills with large majorities, including votes in favor from members of Mr. Yanukovych\xe2\x80\x99s party.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because in the run-up to his departure, the Vice President had been in contact with President Yanukovych on a number of occasions -- something like nine times -- and so he was certainly viewed by this administration as the leader of that country.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was elected President.\xc2\xa0 He has abdicated his responsibilities by, shortly after signing an agreement to bring an end to the violence and take the actions that so many in the world had called on him to take, which was to establish a unity government, to end the violence and move towards early elections, he packed up his belongings and disappeared.\xc2\xa0 So the country has to be governed.\xc2\xa0 The parliament, acting in keeping with its responsibility, has taken steps to ensure that the country is governed.<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked about this before, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try it again.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a political question about the Vice President and Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 They both --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have elections even before 2016.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they both appear to be weighing whether to run for President in 2016, and the Vice President made that abundantly clear in that article in Politico, and Secretary Clinton has been out making speeches.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think it would be better for the Democratic Party to have one leader heading into 2016, for the party to be united behind one leader?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s such a far-off question in terms of its need to be answered that I\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to entertain it.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that the President is focused on an agenda that\xe2\x80\x99s designed to create more opportunity for the American people, to reward hard work and responsibility.\xc2\xa0 That is reflected in what he did yesterday in Minnesota, what he\'s doing today here at the White House, and what he\'s doing every day.\xc2\xa0 He has in the Vice President an extremely effective partner in all that they do together and in the pursuit of an agenda that they share great faith in.</p>\n<p>So the President is focused on that work; the Vice President is focused on that work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s 2014, still early, so there is no reason to be focused on anything else.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Yanukovych, the White House is urging Russia not to take any additional provocative actions.\xc2\xa0 Would the White House see Russia granting safe harbor to Yanukovych as a provocative act?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we don\'t have confirmed information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate on that.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that wherever he is he has clearly left Kyiv, left his office, and has abdicated his responsibilities and undermined his legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 The parliament, on the other hand, has taken responsible action to deal with that void and to deal with the many pressing issues that Ukraine faces.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Our concern, as I expressed earlier, relates to actions outsiders might take that would not advance the goals that we all share, which is a Ukraine that maintains its territorial integrity, that maintains its sovereignty, and that is allowed to move forward in a way that protects the rights of all of its citizens.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re supporting.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re going to support in our efforts with the international community when it comes to economic assistance, and that\'s what we\'re supporting at a diplomatic level.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about -- Speaker Boehner this morning told my colleague, Jeff Zeleny, that in all the conversations they had on Tuesday about a wide variety of issues, immigration was the issue where they most saw eye-to-eye.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner said a few weeks ago, though, that the Republican caucus doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust the President to enforce whatever law Congresses pass.\xc2\xa0 But this morning he said they had a very healthy conversation on the topic.\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some more light on that?\xc2\xa0 And did the President in some way convey more to Speaker Boehner that he is to be trusted on this issues?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can certainly confirm that immigration was one of the topics they discussed.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly confirm that there is broad agreement that this is an issue that needs to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve seen that in the steps that Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders have taken this year, and I think that stands in contrast to the positions and steps they took previously when the operating approach to immigration reform was self-deportation.</p>\n<p>The Senate has acted.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has acted in a bipartisan way with Republican and Democratic support in passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that reflects, not word for word what the President would have written if he were to draw up the bill, but reflects all of the principles that he laid out a long time ago, now, that needed to be met in a comprehensive immigration reform bill.\xc2\xa0 He hopes and expects that the House will act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it is true that he spoke with the Speaker about this.\xc2\xa0 It\'s certainly true that the Speaker has led an effort in the House to produce among House Republicans a set of principles or standards on immigration reform, and we are certainly hopeful that this effort will move forward -- because it\'s going to happen and it needs to happen.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the right thing for our country; it\'s the right thing for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of people with far more insight into the Republican Party than I have currently say that it\'s the right thing for the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>So with all those forces working in its favor, we believe that immigration reform needs to happen and should happen.\xc2\xa0 The question that needs to be answered by Republican leaders is, when?\xc2\xa0 Because, certainly, the sooner the better.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President get any further insight into that in his conversation with Speaker Boehner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a further readout on the conversation except to confirm that that was one of the topics they discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would you say that conversation jump-started things from where they were?\xc2\xa0 Because it was the perception for a couple of weeks that things had sort of fallen off --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it was a good and constructive conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think that the imperative remains today as it did several weeks ago and has for some time now, which is this is something that has the support of Democrats and Republicans across the country; it has the support of an amazingly diverse coalition of stakeholders and interest groups, including big business and law enforcement and faith communities; and it has the backing of solid, responsible economic analysis that demonstrates that passing comprehensive immigration reform would be a boon to the economy, would be good for the middle class, would be good for border security, and would be good for our future development because of the innovation that it would help spur.</p>\n<p>So it\'s all good if done well and in accordance with the principles reflected in the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 So we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And nothing the President heard from the Speaker discouraged him about the prospects of this getting done this year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is fully aware that this has always been -- or for a long time, anyway -- has been a hard issue for the Republican Party.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m not going to characterize his sense about the odds that House Republicans are going to move tomorrow or next week.\xc2\xa0 What I think he conveyed is exactly what he has conveyed publicly, which is that there is an absolute need to do it, there is an overwhelming case behind the need to do it, and that Republicans should act as soon as possible to get it done for the economy, for the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the communications side of Ukraine, is it the Russians\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to be transparent publicly, or should the President not be on the phone more frequently with Vladimir Putin to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no misunderstandings, nothing is misinterpreted either in word or deed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the President did speak with President Putin in a long phone call just several days ago and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week.\xc2\xa0 A lot has happened since then.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- Secretary Kerry has been in contact with his counterpart, Foreign Minister Lavrov, and we are obviously in constant consultation at a variety of levels with the Russian government and others as it relates to the unfolding events in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I think you can be assured that this is an issue that has attention at the highest level, and will as each day passes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a practical matter, for the EU and the United States to put together a financial aid package, can you put the contours of that together and sort of suggest what\xe2\x80\x99s available but need to wait for a government to be formed after these elections in May? Or can you begin to have a serious conversation about delivering money for a government that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually exist?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is the parliament has taken action to create a unity government.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to pursue economic reforms and the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that it will send a team to Ukraine in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think the IMF, our allies and partners in Europe, or the United States is waiting -- are waiting, rather, to take action to provide assistance to Ukraine as it adopts the reforms that are necessary for economic stability and growth.</p>\n<p>So that\'s my read on it.\xc2\xa0 These are very challenging issues. The economic situation in Ukraine is challenging and the need for action is fairly urgent.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we welcome the commitment the government has made and the announcement the IMF has made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, just to follow up on Roberta.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fair to say that with the meeting with Netanyahu Monday, two weeks later, President Abbas, the goal for the month is for the President to get a verbal commitment to the framework itself and extending this process at least for another year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is very focused, as his whole team is, on making progress on this issue and working with the parties on a framework.\xc2\xa0 Achieving a framework means that the parties would have agreed to principles that would guide the final status negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the framework will be a significant breakthrough as it would represent a common picture on the outlines of the final status agreement.</p>\n<p>I don\'t have a timetable to attach to that, but this is a process that was launched by the President, that Secretary Kerry has been very engaged in, as you know, and both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have taken courageous, difficult steps in an effort to demonstrate their determination to try to resolve these issues.</p>\n<p>So the framework is an important step.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll see how the coming weeks unfold in terms of progress on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to the back a little bit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a no?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, you can definitely when I -- Patty, let me call on you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Al Jazeera continue to be unjustly imprisoned in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration still calling for their immediate release?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is, yes.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve expressed concerns about the detainment and trial of Al Jazeera staff and journalists as well as others, and we have expressed those concerns directly to the government of Egypt and we have strongly urged the government to drop these charges and release those journalists who have been detained.</p>\n<p>But we remain deeply concerned about the ongoing lack of freedom of expression and press freedoms in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 The government\xe2\x80\x99s targeting of journalists and others on questionable claims is wrong and it demonstrates an egregious disregard for the protection of basic rights and freedoms.\xc2\xa0 All journalists, regardless of affiliation, must not be targets of violence, intimidation or politicized legal action.\xc2\xa0 They must be permitted to freely do their jobs in Egypt.</p>\n<p>So we are closely watching the trial of Al Jazeera staff and journalists in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 We understand that the defendants pleaded not guilty and that the trial was adjourned until March 5th.\xc2\xa0 We strongly urge the government to allow these and all journalists to continue to do their jobs, and it is impossible to see how they can do that, how any journalist can do their job if they are faced with questionable charges and are detained and on trial.</p>\n<p>Now you can follow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said there\xe2\x80\x99s no framework for the agreement -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no timetable, pardon me, for the agreement to this framework.\xc2\xa0 But didn\xe2\x80\x99t Secretary Kerry set a timetable himself saying he wants it done by the end of April?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re working -- I mean, I would certainly refer you to the Secretary of State, but we are focused on this work and believe that achieving a framework would be an important step towards setting the parameters for final status negotiations.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m simply noting that this work is ongoing, but it is certainly deep and serious.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House and Senate members are being briefed on the status of the talks on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program today.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an unclassified version?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, what\xe2\x80\x99s the question specifically?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re being briefed on the status of the talks on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program today.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an unclassified assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about, which is we are obviously within a time period here in which the P5-plus-1 will test the premise that Iran is now interested in coming to terms with the international community in a way that demonstrates it is abiding by its international obligations and that it is forsaking a nuclear weapon in a transparent and verifiable manner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they being briefed because you believe there\xe2\x80\x99s been progress?\xc2\xa0 Are they being briefed to head off those elements of Congress that want to tighten sanctions on Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, they\xe2\x80\x99re being briefed because it\xe2\x80\x99s this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to brief Congress regularly on matters like this, and this is an ongoing process and it\xe2\x80\x99s wholly appropriate for the administration to brief Congress on it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given Secretary Kerry, who has, in fact, said that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to deal with the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian issue by the end of April, would it have been wiser to resolve Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program -- the questions about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program before putting a timetable on the Israeli-Palestinian issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think these are both important issues and neither should wait.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly, after the international consensus that was forged once the President took office and began pursuing his approach to Iran, the most punitive regime of sanctions that has ever existed was imposed upon Iran, and that has resulted in Iran changing its approach and agreeing to negotiations, and agreeing to the Joint Plan of Action, which commits Iran in a transparent and verifiable way to taking steps to halt its program in some areas and to roll it back in others -- all while we continue work with the P5-plus-1 to see whether or not Iran can take the steps necessary to prove to the world that it is not and will not pursue a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s important work.\xc2\xa0 So is the work that\xe2\x80\x99s being done on the framework and on the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 And both are progressing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, will the President address AIPAC next week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 When we have an announcement to make in terms of representation at AIPAC we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it a little close for you to hold off on making that announcement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When we have an announcement, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have two topics.\xc2\xa0 One on \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper.\xe2\x80\x9d Is this initiative that the President is announcing today going to meld with some of the old efforts that this administration was doing to include the fact that Eric Holder was in charge of the federal government initiative that saw grants going out to organizations like the Urban League and Labor gave them grants and Justice gave people grants to help with at-risk kids.\xc2\xa0 So is there going to be a melding of the old and this new program?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just going to be the new program and that all the other stuff that was going on will fade away?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of effort that\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on creating opportunity for all Americans and, in this case, for boys and young men of color, and that has been reflected in the work that you mentioned and in many other initiatives that have been engaged in over the course of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s time in office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d represents is that in this year of action and in keeping with his commitment to use his pen and phone in creative ways to advance an agenda that opens opportunity to all Americans, he is bringing together businesses and foundations around an effort to make sure that every young man of color who is willing to work hard and lift himself up has an opportunity to get ahead and reach his full potential.\xc2\xa0 So this is, again, reflective of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to use every tool in his toolbox to advance an agenda that expands opportunity.\xc2\xa0 And that includes actions like this that don\xe2\x80\x99t require legislation through Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be both issues -- both items will be working separately but still working to help --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when you say both items I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what specific items you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 The efforts underway by the administration to expand opportunity for Americans across the country continue.\xc2\xa0 This is obviously a new initiative that is focused on the President using his capacity to bring stakeholders together and make commitments towards expanding that opportunity specifically in this case for young boys and men of color.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the second topic, you said earlier to a CNN question about the Vice President, you said it was basically a hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not hypothetical, particularly when the President, earlier this week, said to the National Governors Association there were some governors that were sizing up the curtains.\xc2\xa0 So he sees that there are some people here in this town, around the country that are looking at possibly going into the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 With that said --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of anybody -- that anybody has announced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that said, there is a possibility, a strong possibility of Hillary Clinton and the Vice President going head to head.\xc2\xa0 If that were the case, does that present a tough scenario for President Obama to throw his support behind?\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a hypothetical issue.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 By definition it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- you said \xe2\x80\x9cif this happens, what will the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction be\xe2\x80\x9d -- if.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they are eyeing it, they\xe2\x80\x99re eyeing it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure a lot of people are making decisions about the course of action they\xe2\x80\x99ll take in a couple of years.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the President is very appreciative of the service that Secretary Clinton gave to this administration and to the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy team.\xc2\xa0 And she did excellent work and they have a very good relationship.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to be enormously grateful for the excellent partner he has in Vice President Biden, and has had since the beginning of this administration.\xc2\xa0 And that work, as I was noting earlier, continues to this day.</p>\n<p>I mean, if you look at what help President Obama has asked Vice President Biden to be engaged in as we were talking about earlier, the situation in Ukraine, the effort the Vice President is leading when it comes to skills training, the effort that the Vice President has been involved in to promote enrollment of the Affordable Care Act -- that\'s just reflective of the fact that Vice President Biden is engaged in all aspects of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.</p>\n<p>So this is not -- I promise you this is -- questions about an election that is very far in the future are not weighing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to try again on the question that Josh got yesterday --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You want to ask about Clinton and Biden?\xc2\xa0 No?\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about the postwar plan in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 General Dempsey had said that he needs a plan to be in place by June, or he needs to know by June what the expectations are.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fair timeline?\xc2\xa0 Is that what the White House is looking toward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I obviously refer to and defer to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 What is clear, as we said after the President spoke with President Karzai, is that President Karzai has indicated that he is not willing to sign the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 We are open to signing that agreement later in the year with a new government in place, but the longer that takes, the more constrained a post-2014 mission would be in both size and ambition.\xc2\xa0 And that relates to, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, the issues associated with making plans for drawing down our forces and maintaining a troop presence in 2014, if there is a BSA signed.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timetable to name, except to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sliding scale, and that the longer we go into the year, the more difficult it is to plan for a post-2014 troop presence; and that while we are open to signing a BSA later in the year, the later it goes, the fact is the mission will have to be smaller in scale and ambition.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that there will be no troops in Afghanistan post-2014 if there is not a signed bilateral security agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to be clear, you have given up on trying to convince Karzai?\xc2\xa0 In other words, you\xe2\x80\x99ve moved beyond that phase.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think President Karzai has indicated that he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing, or not likely to sign a BSA.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, if that were to happen, we would welcome it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling for it for some time now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s only reflective of the fact that we negotiated the bilateral security agreement with the current Afghan government and it was endorsed strongly by the loya jirga.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about My Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper, as well.\xc2\xa0 I was just talking to a 19-year-old who came from a very broken home.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s turned his life around, now in college, thanks in part to Covenant House, a community center here, which helped him make that transition.\xc2\xa0 And he says he welcomes the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, it\xe2\x80\x99s a really important first step, but he says it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go nearly far enough because he says the problem is so broad and so far-reaching.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that, that this is really just a first step and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily get to the root of the problem?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, you ought to wait and hear what the President says, and hear more details about the initiative that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be announcing.\xc2\xa0 And I think that what you\xe2\x80\x99ll also note is that the President is calling together stakeholders here, including foundations and businesses, to join the effort in a partnership so that every young man in this country, of color, and every boy of color in this country who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to work hard and lift himself up has an opportunity to get ahead and reach his full potential.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd if the question is, is this a big project and will it take a broad commitment from not just the President and Washington but, very importantly, from outside organizations and businesses, the answer is, of course.\xc2\xa0 But expanding opportunity for all Americans is the essence of the commitment the President has made in the agenda he\xe2\x80\x99s working on for the remainder of his presidency.\xc2\xa0 So this is important work, and he\xe2\x80\x99s gratified that today, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, there are so many organizations that want to join in the effort.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, can you characterize the impact that Trayvon Martin had on President Obama wanting to actually launch this initiative?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President throughout his time in office has championed efforts consistently to support boys and young men of color, not just in his time here as President, but throughout his career.\xc2\xa0 So it predates -- those efforts predate this initiative, they predate certainly the death of Trayvon Martin.</p>\n<p>And while I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of what the President is going to say, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that, as he said, Trayvon\xe2\x80\x99s passing was a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 And several months ago, moved by the Martin family\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy, the President spoke about the need to invest in our young boys and let them know that their country believes in them and is willing to invest in them, and also about the need to promote trust in communities at the local level.</p>\n<p>So the initiative that he\xe2\x80\x99s announcing today builds on that commitment and is reflective of what he talked about in the wake of Trayvon\xe2\x80\x99s tragic death.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just to piggyback on Kristen and April\xe2\x80\x99s questions, is this the first -- or it seems to be the first major -- excuse me, first initiative that the President has taken that\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive to young minorities.\xc2\xa0 Is that the case?\xc2\xa0 I know he\xe2\x80\x99s taken other steps to help young people in general, help them find jobs, summer jobs, work training, all that.\xc2\xa0 But this seems to be the first one that\xe2\x80\x99s targeted exclusively --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that, as I mentioned earlier, he\xe2\x80\x99s championed efforts to support boys and young men of color throughout his career.\xc2\xa0 And that dates back to his time in the Illinois senate, where he helped to pass legislation on racial profiling, to his work in the U.S. Senate, when he introduced the Bayh-Obama Fatherhood bill and co-sponsored the Second Chance Act, and to his work in the White House on fatherhood, on mentoring, on Summer Jobs+.\xc2\xa0 All of that is reflective of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to and work on addressing these issues.</p>\n<p>So today\xe2\x80\x99s initiative is a continuation of that work; it\xe2\x80\x99s not something wholly new in that respect.\xc2\xa0 And I would also say that the work that President Obama has done to expand opportunity for all Americans has had significant benefits for this group of Americans -- young boys and men and color.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you would have to evaluate on your own how distinct this is.\xc2\xa0 But it reflects the commitment that I talked about in answer to Kristen\xe2\x80\x99s question and, more broadly, reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the general principle that we can expand opportunity for all.\xc2\xa0 And for young men and boys of color in this country, the President believes there is a way through an initiative like this to help kids and young men who want to help themselves and are willing to work hard, and are in difficult circumstances to achieve their potential.\xc2\xa0 And he is very grateful for the support that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see demonstrated today behind that idea.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason I asked is I know that some in the African American community, particularly during his first term -- and I know there was a recession going on and everything -- but were critical of him that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough to help minorities who were disproportionally affected in some ways -- excuse me, were disproportionately affected by the recession.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply repeat what I just said about the work the President has done specifically on these issues, and then more broadly on expanding opportunity, and when you talk about the recession, taking action to prevent that recession from becoming a depression.</p>\n<p>And obviously, the recovery from that Great Recession has benefitted those communities that were disproportionately hurt by the recession, as well as all Americans, by stabilizing our economy and returning it to growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work to do, as you hear the President say all the time.\xc2\xa0 This is a piece of that work -- the announcement he has today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You probably want to ask about HRC maybe?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for the brand promotion there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 I hope you picked up your copy.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I expected one on my desk.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I give you a gift?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk after.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can sell him a gift.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I could sell you a gift.\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 First, on Dave Camp\xe2\x80\x99s tax proposal, I\xe2\x80\x99m curious whether the President is committed to getting tax reform done before he leaves office.\xc2\xa0 This is something he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about in the past, not as much lately.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a tepid reaction to the Camp proposal.\xc2\xa0 Some folks say it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done this year.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of commitment to getting something done before he\xe2\x80\x99s gone?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President has demonstrated his commitment to corporate tax reform quite clearly, and continues to speak about it and hopes that Congress would take him up on that grand bargain for jobs that he\xe2\x80\x99s put on the table -- which is eliminating loopholes, broadening the base when it comes to corporate taxes, and using the revenue generated by the effort to invest heavily in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 He talked about that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a very important proposition because it would increase competitiveness, on the one hand, and provide enormous economic benefit through the investments we need to make in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 So I sort of take issue with the idea that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been talking about this, because he has.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecondly, I would say that he\xe2\x80\x99s long advocated reforming our tax code to make it more simple and fair, and is willing to work with both parties to get that done.\xc2\xa0 And even though we\xe2\x80\x99re likely to have some fundamental differences with his approach, it is a positive step, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, that Chairman Camp has put forward his proposal.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President has put forward a proposal for pro-growth business tax reform, as I just mentioned, that lowers rates for businesses to make them more competitive, and broadens the base using the one-time revenue generated through that process to invest in our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The President has fought to ensure our tax code is more fair by closing unfair tax loopholes, keeping rates low for 98 percent of American families, and ensuring that the wealthiest pay their fair share.</p>\n<p>It appears that Chairman Camp is embracing the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to use revenue through corporate tax reform to invest in infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 And Chairman Camp\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would close the carried interest loophole, the corporate jet loophole, and many of the other unfair loopholes that benefit big corporations and the wealthiest but don\xe2\x80\x99t help the economy.\xc2\xa0 The President has been pushing to eliminate several of these loopholes for years, and we agree that they need to be addressed to make the system more fair.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, we are concerned that the proposal fails to raise revenue to contribute to balanced deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to further deficit reduction, to build on the significant deficit reduction he has overseen, involves a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, Chairman Camp\xe2\x80\x99s proposal appears to add to the long-term deficit rather than reduce it.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the President believes we should be looking for ways to reward hard work and expand opportunity for American workers, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he fought to extend and expand the EITC. And it\xe2\x80\x99s simply not the right time, in his view, to raise taxes on working people.</p>\n<p>Now, having said that, we look forward to working with members of both parties on this issue moving forward, and we certainly view Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s Camp proposal as a positive step.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to get to the question you were anticipating, and build on Jim -- (laughter) -- the President in 2008 and 2012 told the American public, and I think believed earnestly that Joe Biden was the best person to be President of the United States other than Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 What would change about that in 2016?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a hypothetical about who may or may not run for 2016.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that Joe Biden would be a good President and could be President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he chose him as Vice President.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why responsible candidates for President choose as a running mate someone they believe can fill that office.\xc2\xa0 And the President has great faith in Vice President Biden, in his abilities, and in, most importantly, the partnership they have working for an agenda that expands opportunity and rewards hard work, and keeps our nation safe.</p>\n<p>But questions about 2016 are just not on his mind, and since my job is to channel him from this podium they\xe2\x80\x99re not on my mind either.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two things, quickly.\xc2\xa0 One, back on immigration.\xc2\xa0 While Congress is not doing anything on immigration, there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing cry from groups like NALEO, the AFL-CIO for the President to sign an executive order ending the deportations that are now taking place at a rate of 1,000 a day.\xc2\xa0 These are people who would qualify for citizenship under the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but they\xe2\x80\x99re now being deported by DHS.\xc2\xa0 Is there any plan for the President to sign such an executive order?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, the immigration system is broken, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it requires comprehensive reform.\xc2\xa0 We have 11 million people living in the shadows and too many employers who game the system by hiring undocumented workers.\xc2\xa0 Neither is good for the country, for families, or the economy.\xc2\xa0 We need a permanent solution that provides people an earned path to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 And as the President said in his State of the Union address, he is committed to achieving a lasting solution and working with the broad-based coalition that support reform.</p>\n<p>As the President has made clear, going to your question, the job of the executive branch is to carry out the laws that are passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 The administration has taken a series of steps to focus our resources and make immigration enforcement more strategic, including focusing on criminals and the use of deferred action for young immigrants known as DREAMers.\xc2\xa0 The only permanent solution is a legislative one that would provide a broad-based path to earned citizenship, and that can only be achieved by Congress.\xc2\xa0 It can\xe2\x80\x99t be achieved by the President.</p>\n<p>So I think the President has answered this question many times.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused, as I was talking about earlier, on the real potential here because of the broad, bipartisan support across the country, because of the broad coalition that supports comprehensive immigration reform on getting that permanent solution done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but while you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for the permanent solution, does it make sense to deport people who could qualify for citizenship -- and would under your own plan -- at a rate of 1,000 a day?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, what I can tell you is that the executive branch, as the President has made clear, has as its job carrying out the laws that are passed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 And it is simply not accurate to suggest that there is a way around Congress to find a solution here to the broader problem.\xc2\xa0 This is why we need comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why it needs to be comprehensive.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen substantial progress towards getting that done, and we ought to go the final yard here and see it turned into law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a growing public debate in this country and the FDA is soon going to rule on e-cigarettes.\xc2\xa0 So my question is are e-cigarettes allowed on the White House campus?\xc2\xa0 And has the President ever tried one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President gave up smoking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, this is not an answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he has not, to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen one on campus, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no rule against them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of, but I certainly haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anyone pull one out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Next Tuesday, the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is coming out.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us any more about what might be in it?\xc2\xa0 And also, is he going to be traveling or giving speeches?\xc2\xa0 Or how is going to publicize that budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, and stay tuned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just real quick --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What -- you got something on your BlackBerry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a BlackBerry, it\xe2\x80\x99s an iPhone.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Burn right there.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Lavrov-Kerry call, was that a new call, or is that the one from several days ago that you were referencing at the top?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been communicating regularly.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the last -- do we know, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s a recent one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Recent one.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll get -- State probably has the timing on it.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- one foreign, one domestic.\xc2\xa0 On the BSA in Afghanistan, at the end of the year the administration insisted that it be signed by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 In January, the administration insisted that it be signed within weeks, not months.\xc2\xa0 This week, we learned that it could be signed in months -- after April, as a matter of fact.\xc2\xa0 Did the situation change on the ground or was the administration bluffing when it --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, look, what we said is that it should be signed by the end of the year because that was the commitment made by the Afghan government as well as the U.S. government, as they set forth to negotiate and finish negotiating in good faith the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 What we said all along is that it needed to be signed promptly, because not signing it promptly would affect our ability and the ability of our NATO allies to plan for a post-2014 troop presence.\xc2\xa0 It would also necessitate that the Pentagon and our NATO allies plan for no troop presence beyond 2014.\xc2\xa0 And what we said then was true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are now planning for, as a contingency, the zero option. And that\xe2\x80\x99s necessitated by the fact that despite the fact that his government negotiated the bilateral security agreement, despite the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s been endorsed by representatives of the Afghan people, President Karzai has indicated he is unlikely to sign it.</p>\n<p>So what we said earlier this week and what the President told President Karzai is that should a future government be willing to sign it, we would be open to that and open to a post-2014 troop presence.\xc2\xa0 But because of the timeline here, because of the challenges that planning for a force like that and a transition like that represent, the later it goes, by necessity, the smaller in scale and ambition that mission would be.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s in keeping with what we said all along.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is still our view that it would have been better to sign it by the end of the year; it would have been better to sign it last month.\xc2\xa0 But recognizing what President Karzai has indicated, we took the step that we took earlier this week to make clear that we would be open to moving forward with a signed BSA should it be signed later in the year, understanding the impact that would have on a future mission.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay -- domestic.\xc2\xa0 You clearly loathe to talk about any potential rivalry between Secretary Clinton and the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You really are demonstrating for the massive audience that watches this briefing how the charge against the Washington press corps is true, which is that you guys care mostly about elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the ironic thing is -- I mean, sooner or later it\xe2\x80\x99s going to subsume everything.\xc2\xa0 And clearly you loathe --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Later.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah, okay, later.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So has anybody spoken to the Vice President about perhaps refraining from talking about his presidential prospects?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know Vice President Biden.\xc2\xa0 I know Vice President Biden.\xc2\xa0 When he is asked a question, he answers it.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he does.\xc2\xa0 And I would point you to what he said.\xc2\xa0 What I know -- because we work with him, we see the work that he does -- he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on -- and if you look at his schedule, he can prove it to you -- he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the work he\xe2\x80\x99s doing with the President on behalf of this administration to expand opportunity for the American people today and this year.\xc2\xa0 He is not focused on, nor is the President, speculation about what might happen in a couple of years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s talking to a Democratic state chairman today.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a Democrat.\xc2\xa0 The President is talking to Democrats, too.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who might run for President.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Come on, Mark.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has been out there working hard on behalf of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, and I think any examination of his schedule reflects that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:22 P.M.
