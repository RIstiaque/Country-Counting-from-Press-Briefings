Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:06 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Patriots --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You must have lost a bet.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did lose a bet to -- (laughter) -- resident Patriots fan here at the White House, Jen Friedman, and I had a little bet over the weekend, and it did not go my way.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sipping from this mug.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thirsty?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I probably will be over the course of today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s deflated, I hear.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 It is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- dissing the Chiefs by using the Royals mug before?\xc2\xa0 You could have had a Chiefs mug and it could all be different.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe so.\xc2\xa0 What I had planned, though, is that by using the Royals mug it was going to sort of confer some good luck on the Chiefs.\xc2\xa0 But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite work out that way.\xc2\xa0 But the Chiefs had a great year, and obviously they won 11 games in a row.\xc2\xa0 And, Kevin, I think you and I even had the opportunity to talk about how the team would recover from a difficult loss early in the year.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We did.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And we discussed how it would be pretty revealing in terms of the character of the team, and a team that endured a string of losses at the beginning but then came back to win 11 in a row is I think testament to their character.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s actually your team that ended up in the AFC championship game.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m very excited about that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So it should be a fun weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo now that we have the football pleasantries out of the way, we can get down to business, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of business to talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go ahead and get us started with some questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Quiet weekend for you?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was going to say -- it was anything other than a traditional, quiet three-day weekend in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 But obviously it was a great weekend for the country and for the families of those who had been deprived of the company of their loved ones for far too long.\xc2\xa0 And there obviously was a lot of work that went into the efforts that culminated this weekend, but also a lot of celebrating going on, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there will be some questions on Iran, but I want to start actually with immigration.\xc2\xa0 If the Supreme Court rules in your favor later this year, on the immigration plan, how long would it take the White House to execute that plan to shield these people from deportation?\xc2\xa0 And is there a plan in place to frontload that in the few remaining months that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have before this administration comes to an end?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to be careful about being respectful for the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear the arguments on both sides.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of confidence in the legal arguments that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be making before the court.\xc2\xa0 The kinds of executive actions that the President took a little over a year ago now to try to bring some much-needed reforms and greater accountability to our broken immigration system were clearly consistent with the precedent that was established by other Presidents, and clearly within the confines of his authority as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That is certainly the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the argument that will be presented to the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it should be noted that there\xe2\x80\x99s one state, Texas, that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of leading the charge against these executive actions before the Supreme Court, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll note that there are 15 other states and the District of Columbia that have filed paperwork indicating they strongly support the implementation of these executive actions.\xc2\xa0 And there are actually law enforcement officials inside the state of Texas that are hoping -- and have, again, communicated to the Court as well -- that are hoping that these executive actions will be able to go into force because it will make their communities inside the state of Texas safer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong argument to make both in terms of the legal ground on which we\xe2\x80\x99re operating, but also in terms of the practical impact, positive impact that these executive actions will have on the security of communities all across the country, a positive impact on our economy, and obviously a positive impact on thousands of families inside the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that all the Republican candidates are saying that they would tear this up as they came into office, are you comfortable, if this goes your way and you have a chance to execute this, asking these immigrants, who are here illegally, to come out of the shadows and identify themselves?\xc2\xa0 I mean, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you asking them to really put themselves out on a limb, considering what could come next?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Josh, this was an argument that was made by some in advance of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- the administration\xe2\x80\x99s decision to implement DACA.\xc2\xa0 This is essentially -- that would allow DREAMers, those individuals who entered the United States as young children, and giving them a status -- has given them the ability to live out the kind of life that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President announced these executive actions in an election year, in 2012.\xc2\xa0 And there were some who suggested that there might not be a significant number of people who would sign up for this program because it could be reversed by a President who succeeded Barack Obama.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen a pretty strong take-up rate when it comes to these DREAM Act protections that are extended, like I said, to individuals who entered the United States as children, essentially through no fault of their own.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to apply one case to the other, but the recent evidence that we can point to would indicate that there are a lot of people who would benefit from this decision who would take advantage of the benefits as soon as they possibly could.\xc2\xa0 And the good news is that the benefits are not just going to be enjoyed by individuals who qualify, but also would be enjoyed by the broader country and by our economy.\xc2\xa0 Like I said, there are law enforcement officials across the country who believe that the successful implementation of these executive actions would make their communities safer because it would focus law enforcement resources on felons and others who posed a threat to the community, and not on separating families.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been some academic work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done by the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic advisers that indicate the broader economic benefit for the country is pretty significant when you take a look at the impact it would have on economic growth over the course of 10 years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to ask you about the Democratic debate on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 The President was a hot topic in South Carolina.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I heard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Hillary Clinton, in particular, accusing Sanders of campaigning against the President and of not being sufficiently supportive of his agenda.\xc2\xa0 Does the President at this point have any opinion or thoughts about which of the Democratic candidates is best positioned to carry on his agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if the President does have an opinion about that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not one that he\xe2\x80\x99s communicated publicly because presumably it would have an impact on his decision about who he plans to support in the primary.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, the President is not prepared to offer up an endorsement.\xc2\xa0 But reading the coverage of the debate, I think it is apparent that there are -- that the Democratic candidates are pretty enthusiastic about the progress that the country has made under the leadership of President Obama.\xc2\xa0 And I think each of them made pretty clear that, if given the opportunity to serve as President of the United States, they would look to build on the important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously -- it certainly beats the alternative and it certainly is a testament to the amount of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made, and we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to hear it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roberta.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if a Republican wins the White House, how will you ensure that the immigration action, should you be successful in the Supreme Court case, isn\xe2\x80\x99t turned off on January 21st?\xc2\xa0 Is there some way to secure the longevity of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the most effective way for us to secure the longevity of these reforms is to actually have Congress pass legislation that would enact them.\xc2\xa0 And there is strong support for that across the country, but strong opposition to that in the House Republican conference.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 But look, that is the difference -- this is why -- or at least one of the important reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99ve often made the case that the President taking executive action does not absolve Congress of their responsibility to pass legislation.\xc2\xa0 And this is one reason why -- that executive actions can be, in most cases, reversed by subsequent Presidents.\xc2\xa0 Legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s passed is more enduring and requires another act of Congress in most cases to change it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press Congress to take these important steps.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what the President said in November of 2014 when he announced these actions is that he was only taking these actions and taking these steps because Congress had failed to act; that he would continue to push Congress to act even though he was taking these steps.\xc2\xa0 And he also noted that if Congress were to pass legislation, that he was happy to have congressional legislation supersede the executive actions that he had taken.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this ultimately is a reflection of a President who is determined to do everything he possibly can to try to fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, we need to see Congress take some steps.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you, with the CBO numbers out today -- CBO\xe2\x80\x99s view of the economy is pretty weak.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And CBO said that the deficit is going to grow this year because of the permanent tax breaks cast late last year.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House is worried that that uptick, combined with pressures from the election, political pressures, is going to make it harder to expand the EITC.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 The first is that we will be releasing a budget of our own here in a couple of weeks that will lay out what we believe is an effective path forward for investing in the middle class, growing our economy, and doing so in a fiscally responsible way.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is what -- that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision since he took office and it\xe2\x80\x99s also consistent with his record, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen strong economic growth in job creation since the economic recovery took hold.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of 70 consecutive months of job growth -- about 14 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication of a strong bounce back from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since the President took office, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also succeeded in reducing the deficit by about 75 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s important progress, too, and the President wants to build on all of that momentum, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll lay out in his budget proposal how exactly we can do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to the birthday boy next.\xc2\xa0 Jon, happy birthday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday, we learned that the United States made a payment to the government of Iran of $1.7 billion.\xc2\xa0 Was this tied to the deal that led to the freedom of the Americans that were being held in Iran?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, this is actually the result of a long-running claims process that had been at The Hague.\xc2\xa0 In 1979, there was obviously an Iranian revolution that abruptly severed relations between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And prior to that revolution, the U.S. government had entered into an agreement with the then-Iranian government to transfer about $400 million in military equipment to the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 Once the revolution took place, obviously that equipment was not transferred, but we also didn\'t return Iran\xe2\x80\x99s money either.\xc2\xa0 So that money essentially was held in what could, I think -- essentially in an escrow account.\xc2\xa0 And for more than 30 years now, the Iranians have been using this claims process at The Hague to try to recover that $400 million.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This resolution that we agreed to was to return the $400 million and also to pay about $1 billion in interest.\xc2\xa0 Now, the reason that this ends up being a very good deal for taxpayers is that our exposure, when it came to paying interest, could have been much higher.\xc2\xa0 The Iranians were actually seeking $7 billion to $8 billion in interest payments.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s an indication of how the interests of taxpayers were very well served by reaching this settlement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but as I understand it, the Department of State announced this payment of $1.7 billion to the government of Iran just before the plane carrying the freed Americans landed in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 You\'re really telling me that this is an absolute coincidence that this payment just happened to coincide with the precise moment when the American prisoners were flying to freedom?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear that this is not a coincidence.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, these kinds of diplomatic opportunities --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it was -- because Paul Ryan has suggested this was a ransom payment.\xc2\xa0 You saw his statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s wrong about that.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\'re saying that this is connected with the freedom of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the successful resolution of our concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program created a series of diplomatic opportunities for the United States that we\xe2\x80\x99ve capitalized on.\xc2\xa0 And we used that opening and we used that deeper diplomatic engagement to secure the release of five American citizens who are being unjustly held inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 And we used that diplomatic opening to resolve a longstanding financial claim that the Iranians had against the United States in a way that ultimately saves U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, potentially up to $6 billion or $7 billion.\xc2\xa0 So this is exhibit A in the administration pursuing tough, principled diplomacy in a way that actually ends up making the American people safer and advancing the interests of the United States more effectively than military actions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me ask you, now that this is the third time by my count that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a situation where Americans who are being held are freed in exchange for something else -- we had five Taliban freed to get the release of Bowe Bergdahl; we had three convicted Cuban spies freed to get the release of Alan Gross; and now we have five Americans who, as you said, were illegally detained, improperly detained by the Iranian government, freed in exchange for seven who had been duly charged and convicted under American law.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t this give an incentive for America\xe2\x80\x99s enemies to take Americans -- either kidnap or imprison Americans -- knowing full well that this administration has proved a willingness to give them something in return to get their release?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me just go back to one thing on Cuba.\xc2\xa0 Alan Gross was released as a humanitarian gesture.\xc2\xa0 The --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Coincided exactly with the release of three convicted Cuban spies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In exchange for a U.S. intelligence asset that the Cuban government had been holding for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And so that was essentially a spy swap.\xc2\xa0 And there had been one previous --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alan Gross was a spy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, Alan Gross was not a spy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he is --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said it was a spy swap.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Alan Gross was released as a humanitarian gesture by the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 There was an additional U.S. intelligence asset that was held by the Cuban government.\xc2\xa0 That individual was released in exchange for the three other individuals that you referred to.\xc2\xa0 And there was also an exchange between the United States and Russia -- a spy swap -- that was engineered in 2010 or so, I believe, and that related to a case of individuals that had infiltrated the United States that were then uprooted by our counter-intelligence officials here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But to go more directly to your question, Jon, the President believes strongly that pursuing diplomacy with the Iranians in a tough, principled way to secure the release of five Americans who are being unjustly detained inside of Iran is in our national security interest and clearly is in the interest of those individuals who had not had the opportunity to -- who had been separated from their families for years.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what we saw was that essentially was a humanitarian gesture that was offered up by the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 We made a reciprocal humanitarian gesture by releasing seven individuals, six of whom were U.S. nationals, who had either been tried and convicted of nonviolent crimes -- essentially sanctions violations or violations of the trade embargo the United States has in place against Iran.\xc2\xa0 Three of those people had been convicted.\xc2\xa0 The other four were still awaiting trial.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the President believes that this is a reflection of what can be accomplished when the United States pursues tough, principled diplomacy even with countries like Iran with whom we have significant and longstanding disagreements.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Senate Armed Services Committee is going to proceed with the confirmation hearing of Eric Fanning as Army Secretary.\xc2\xa0 How confident is the President that the Senate will confirm his nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Fanning certainly deserves confirmation.\xc2\xa0 And we are confident that he will make a very positive presentation to the United States Senate for this job.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who is eminently qualified and has served his country with distinction.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has a range of experience at the Pentagon, and somebody who is certainly in a good position to provide the kind of leadership at the United States Army that our men and women deserve.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If confirmed, Mr. Fanning will be the first openly gay person confirmed by the U.S. Senate as civilian head of a military department.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. Senate given the White House assurances that sexual orientation will not be an issue during the confirmation process?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to all of the conversations between the administration and individual members of the Senate. Mr. Fanning was nominated because the President believes that he is the best person to provide good leadership to our men and women in uniform in the United States Army.\xc2\xa0 Given his experience, given his character, given his skills as a leader, the President believes that he is the best person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And I think anybody in the United States Senate who\xe2\x80\x99s willing to take an impartial look and judge him solely on the merits will reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Toluse.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to try to re-ask Josh\xe2\x80\x99s question about the immigration ruling, about how quickly you can actually get work permits and get people out of the shadows if this ruling is in your favor.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that can be done before the next election?\xc2\xa0 Is the infrastructure already in place to start issuing these work permits and getting this program up and running, given the fact that the President only has a year left in office?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, Toluse, I want to be deferential of the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 They have a role to play here, and so I certainly want to be respectful of that role.\xc2\xa0 The administration believes strongly that the prompt implementation of these executive actions would have positive benefits for our economy, would have positive benefits for the security of communities across the country.\xc2\xa0 So we\'re certainly interested in moving forward with implementing these executive actions as expeditiously as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the Supreme Court has a role to play here, and we\'re going to make a presentation to the Supreme Court about why we should be allowed to do that.\xc2\xa0 And at this point, I\'m just not in a position to provide you a lot of guidance about what would happen in the event of a positive outcome at the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly have a lot of confidence in our arguments, but ultimately we\'ll have to see how those arguments play out before I can give you a lot of detail about our ability to move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about Flint, as well as the President is going to Detroit tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He signed a disaster declaration, I believe, or emergency declaration over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to visit Flint on his trip to Detroit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did, over the weekend, sign this emergency declaration that would allow the federal government to provide up to $5 million in assistance to state and local officials that are trying to manage that response.\xc2\xa0 This comes on top of the assistance that the federal government has already provided in the form of both expertise and logistical support.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the city of Flint and the citizens of Flint are going to be going through a very difficult time, and the U.S. government is determined to do what we can to support the state and local officials who are responsible for responding to this incident.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So let me tell you about a couple of things that we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that later today, the Department of Health and Human Services will designate an individual -- this woman\xe2\x80\x99s name is Dr. Nicole Lurie.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.\xc2\xa0 And she will be the lead federal appointee, the lead federal official to coordinate the federal response to this particular situation.\xc2\xa0 Given the significant public health equities that are involved, it makes sense that somebody from HHS would play this role.\xc2\xa0 And so she will be principally responsible for dealing with state and local officials and coordinating the assistance that can be provided by the federal government, not just by HHS but also federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the EPA, and others -- the United States Department of Agriculture -- that can provide some assistance here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can also tell you that the Mayor of Flint, Karen Weaver, is visiting the White House today on a prescheduled trip.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Conference of Mayors is meeting in Washington this week, and there is a special session held at the White House for newly elected mayors.\xc2\xa0 And I know that in advance of that group meeting with other newly elected mayors, Mayor Weaver had the opportunity to sit down today with Valerie Jarrett, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Senior Advisor, to discuss some of the challenges that the city is facing right now.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as a newly elected mayor, she\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of responsibility that she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to juggle, and so we felt it was important for staff at the White House to have an opportunity to hear at some length the challenges that are facing the city.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would expect before the end of the day that the President will have an opportunity to visit with Mayor Weaver, as well, while she\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 And again, it\'s an opportunity for the President to hear from the mayor of Flint on the significant challenges that are facing that city.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all that activity, I would not expect that the President will stop in Flint on his trip tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously got a full schedule where he\'ll spend some time talking about the tremendous economic recovery that the city of Detroit has made.\xc2\xa0 And a lot of that economic strength and economic recovery was possible only because of some of the difficult decisions that this administration made early on to make the auto recovery possible and to reinvigorate the American manufacturing sector.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, during the debate, Hillary Clinton brought up race in relation to the Flint water crisis thing -- that essentially because it\'s a majority-black town, this issue was being ignored.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that view, that race played a role in this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at least I can tell you from the perspective of the Obama administration, based on what I\'ve just told you about the FEMA response and the HHS leadership role, and the meetings that will take place at the White House today, I think this situation is anything but being ignored by the White House.\xc2\xa0 I know there are questions that have been raised about the conduct of state and local officials in leading to this particular situation, but I\'m quite limited in what I can say about that because the Department of Justice has indicated that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing investigation into this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the response, this is obviously a response that is and should be led by state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 But the federal government is mobilizing significant resources to support that ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more, on Iran.\xc2\xa0 You all put forward some ballistic missile-related sanctions over the weekend, and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s foreign ministry said today that they plan to continue their ballistic missile program, which they say is legal.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you have a reaction to that, or if there are any other tools that you have at your disposal to try to deter Iran from moving forward with their ballistic missile program.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Toluse, I think what you\'re asking actually is a good way for us to talk about one other aspect of the history that was made over the course of the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, the IAEA was able to confirm that Iran had taken the steps to curtail their nuclear program, consistent with the international agreement to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And they had to take a number of steps that included essentially dismantling two-thirds of the installed centrifuge capacity that they previously had.\xc2\xa0 They reduced their enriched uranium stockpile by 98 percent.\xc2\xa0 They essentially dismantled and rendered harmless the core of their heavy-water reactor at Arak.\xc2\xa0 They shipped out a significant quantity of heavy water outside of the country to come into compliance with the standards of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we also saw Iran do something that they had never done before, which is to agree to and begin to cooperate with a set of unprecedented transparency and verification measures into their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And we will now have continuous monitoring of all of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s declared nuclear facilities.\xc2\xa0 This will include a range of measures, including technology seals to ensure that they continue to abide by the commitments that they made in the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This inspection and verification regime will also allow the international community to have insight and access to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s entire nuclear supply chain.\xc2\xa0 This means that there will be ongoing inspections and monitoring of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s uranium mines and uranium mills and of the facilities that are critical to their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And all along, we\'ll be able to confirm that their nuclear activities are solely for peaceful purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mind you, these are all things that could not have been accomplished if we had pursued the strategy that was advocated by some to carry out a military strike.\xc2\xa0 We would not have been successful in setting back Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program so far if we\xe2\x80\x99d carried out a nuclear strike.\xc2\xa0 We would not have preserved the international unanimity of opinion about the best way to prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and we certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to monitor their ongoing nuclear activities.\xc2\xa0 If anything, it would have been much harder to preserve international unanimity on this issue and it would have been much harder for us to gain insight into what exactly Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program was doing.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think this is another example of the success of principled diplomacy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is why we believe that we can continue to advance the interests of the United States, whether that is preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, securing the release of innocent Americans being held against their will overseas, or resolving longstanding financial claims at The Hague, all through tough, principled diplomacy, even with a country with whom we have significant concerns.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the United States imposed sanctions on Iran for their ballistic missile program is an indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re quite serious about continuing to hold Iran accountable for their nefarious activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, I understand the claims that are made by the Iranians that what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is not in violation of international law, but the fact is, you had the United Nations Security Council come out and express concerns about these kinds of activities.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the international community continues to have concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program, and I think the one thing we can all agree on is it sure is a good thing they don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to a nuclear weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Did you have an opportunity to talk to the President about the Levinson family\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment, great disappointment, that he was not part of the number of Americans who have recently been freed?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what is his position with regard to notification, with regard to maybe making more inroads to bring that man home?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Levinson family.\xc2\xa0 The ordeal that they have been through over the last almost nine years now is virtually unthinkable.\xc2\xa0 To imagine how difficult the situation must be for them is hard to do.\xc2\xa0 And this administration has repeatedly, over the years, pressed the Iranians to be more forthcoming and to provide information about his whereabouts. \xc2\xa0And one of the things that was actually secured in this agreement was a specific commitment from the Iranians to help us locate Mr. Levinson.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, as we mentioned several years ago, we have reason to believe that he no longer is in Iran, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we continue to press for information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve secured a commitment from the Iranians to use the channel that has now been opened to secure the release of those individuals that we know were being held by Iran on unjustly to use those same channels to try to gather information about Mr. Levinson\xe2\x80\x99s possible whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make that a priority moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And I recognize, and I readily acknowledge, that that does not address the significant pain that\xe2\x80\x99s being sustained by the Levinson family right now.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been separated from their loved one, and deeply concerned about his safety and health and wellbeing is something that we all feel.\xc2\xa0 But we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it as deeply as those who know and love Bob Levinson.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I\xe2\x80\x99m correct then, you\xe2\x80\x99re confident that he is alive, and I\xe2\x80\x99m getting that distinction because you said we believe he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer in Iran.\xc2\xa0 So you do believe or you do know that he is still alive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment of that.\xc2\xa0 I know that there was some publicity in the last couple of years where whoever was holding Mr. Levinson put out a so-called proof-of-life evidence.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment to share with you.\xc2\xa0 What we are determined to do, though, is to press the Iranians to provide as much information as they have about Mr. Levinson\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do that through the channel that has been opened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a liaison or a contact person within the administration that could reach out to the Levinsons?\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m sensitive to the notion, in listening to some of the comments recently from the family, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that he was going to be part of this group.\xc2\xa0 I was under the impression that there was someone who might, from the administration, be able to reach out to them in advance, or at least to maintain some level of communication.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like that happened in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, there actually has been extensive communication on the part of the administration to the Levinson family.\xc2\xa0 And over the weekend, there were senior officials here in the administration that were in touch with the Levinson family.\xc2\xa0 They were last --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was before everyone knew about the release?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think all of you knew who were following the news on Saturday morning, that there was an announcement that was made by the semi-official news agency in Iran that was not coordinated with the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously were treating this information quite sensitively until we knew we could secure the safe return of our citizens who were still in Iran at the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this was a delicate situation, but it is important for people to understand that the administration has been in touch with the Levinson family; we were over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 The Levinson family last received an update on our efforts shortly before Christmas in another conversation they had with senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of this process, the President himself has on at least one occasion had the opportunity to be in touch directly with the Levinson family.\xc2\xa0 And they are part of the hostage recovery task force that the President formed over the summer to improve the way that information is provided to the families of those who are being held hostage overseas.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very sensitive to the concerns and rather raw feelings of the Levinson family.\xc2\xa0 I think the feelings that are on display are, I think, feelings that no one can really relate to unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through something like that.\xc2\xa0 But I think we can all imagine, just in our mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye, what that must be like and how painful that must be.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are very sensitive to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on the Iran deal.\xc2\xa0 The windfall -- people have made a great deal about the money.\xc2\xa0 Is there great concern from the President that, now flushed with cash, that the regime will not only do what they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a habit of doing, which is sort of using their resources to cause problems all over the world, but is there greater concern now that they have more money that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be emboldened to take an even larger role in the region?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kevin, the thing that we do know about their economy is that it has suffered significant negative consequences as a result of the sanctions that were put in place.\xc2\xa0 After all, that\'s why we know that Iran came to the negotiating table was because of their desire to get out from under these very tough international sanctions.\xc2\xa0 And it has meant that there is a lot of rebuilding of their economy that they need to -- their infrastructures projects that they need to undertake.\xc2\xa0 There are also large bills that have remained unpaid that also are coming due.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the kinds of financial benefits that Iran will reap from this deal have been exaggerated by critics of the deal.\xc2\xa0 But we would acknowledge that they will have access to more resources.\xc2\xa0 And we would expect that they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to use at least some of those resources for some of the kinds of malign activities that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been involved with for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And that is why over the last couple of years, you\'ve seen the President lead the effort to try to deepen our security cooperation with our friends and partners and allies in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process right now with Israel to deepen and lengthen the memorandum of understanding that governs the military-to-military relationship between the United States and Israel.\xc2\xa0 There potentially is, in the context of negotiating that agreement, additional military assistance that could be provided to our Israeli allies by the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President convened a meeting at Camp David with our GCC partners to discuss how the United States and our Gulf partners could more effectively coordinate our security efforts.\xc2\xa0 And some of that includes countering some of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s destabilizing activities in the region.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly committed to that effort, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But overall, our top objective here had been to shut down every pathway that Iran has to building a nuclear weapon, precisely because of their support for terrorism, precisely because of their destabilizing activities in the region, precisely because of their missile program, precisely because of their willingness to threaten Israel.\xc2\xa0 And that objective has been accomplished in a way that has been far more effective than some of the alternative strategies that have been advocated by our critics.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you saw this last thing.\xc2\xa0 A federal judge rejecting the President\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of executive privilege to deny Congress access to records pertaining to Operation Fast and Furious.\xc2\xa0 Did you hear about that before coming out?\xc2\xa0 And if so, do you have any reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear about that ruling before I came out here, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tribunal and the Iranians, is it true that there were some 4,700 claims made by the U.S. for a total of about $2.5 billion, and that all of the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 claims have been settled?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is true that there are 4,200 claims through this claims process at The Hague that have been made by U.S. citizens or U.S. businesses.\xc2\xa0 And many of those claims have been settled to the tune of $2.5 billion that was paid out by the Iranians to these American nationals or to these American companies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As it relates to this debt, I don\'t know to what extent there are ongoing claims, but I think it is indicative of how the claims process has been able to make some American businesses and American nationals whole.\xc2\xa0 And again, it also reflects sort of how this established channel -- a separate channel than the nuclear channel, a separate channel than the one that led to the release of our American citizens but one that nonetheless yielded significant economic benefits for American taxpayers, because we potentially saved billions of dollars by resolving the claims in the way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve described.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was any of that money used to settle claims on behalf of the Americans who were taken hostage in the first place back in the 1970s?\xc2\xa0 Or the families?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that these kinds of claims are actually different.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of claims relate to contractual obligations and other agreements that were ruptured in the context of the Iranian revolution in 1979.\xc2\xa0 So this is a process that was actually established right around that time -- I believe it was 1981 -- by the -- that was sort of set up -- negotiated by the Carter administration and then eventually set up by the Reagan administration; both administrations were involved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Obama administration ever bring up this issue of compensation to the families or to the individuals who were taken hostage back in 1979?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That was separate from these discussions.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the way that these claims could be resolved is that, according to the statute, as long as these claims are resolved in a way that is favorable to U.S. taxpayers -- and clearly it is, we saved billions of dollars here based on what the Iranians have been asking for -- that this fulfills all of our obligations under the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so it sounds like this issue of compensation for the 50 hostages or so was not an issue and it\xe2\x80\x99s a closed issue?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any of the claims that are made by those who have been the victim of terrorism that was sponsored by the Iranian government or held hostage by the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any of those claims.\xc2\xa0 But my understanding is simply that these claims that were settled at The Hague were different from those.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Flint, you said that the federal government has done a lot, so much in their meetings at the White House, so on and so forth.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the mayor is asking and the governor are asking for a significant amount more money than the $5 million through the emergency declaration, and asking for a disaster declaration, which would be about $100 million.\xc2\xa0 So what do you say to them?\xc2\xa0 Because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like even close to what they say they need.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, just to be clear about what the law will allow here, a disaster declaration is essentially something that FEMA offers routinely to state and local governments who have sustained a natural catastrophe or a fire, flood, or explosion.\xc2\xa0 And none of those events has occurred in Flint.\xc2\xa0 So by statute, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult to grant that request for a major disaster declaration.\xc2\xa0 There is an opportunity for the governor to appeal that ruling, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it up to him to decide whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a regular process for considering those kinds of appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what we have, however, done is granted their request for an emergency declaration that will allow us to provide some resources as they work to recover from this situation.\xc2\xa0 And there are resources that can be mobilized by USDA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the EPA, obviously, and HHS, obviously, to assist the state and the city in weathering this rather challenging situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Knowing this gap -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sound flip, but that sounds like what an insurance company says to somebody who is claiming the flood in their basement or something -- is the administration proactively trying to marshal more resources because you\xe2\x80\x99re well aware that there is like a $90 million or so gap between what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying they need and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to provide so far?\xc2\xa0 So is there a proactive process going on to fill that gap?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ron, certainly this is a situation that we take seriously.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t mean to sound flip about it, even in response, but the U.S. government also has an obligation to our taxpayers to make sure that funds are being spent consistent with the statute and with the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to what we can mobilize to support them, there certainly is a lot of expertise and resources that we can make available through existing programs.\xc2\xa0 And so let me give you a couple of examples.\xc2\xa0 The USDA, for example, has waived requirements on potable tap water availability at school meal service, instead allowing schools to provide bottled water.\xc2\xa0 The WIC program -- this is the Women, Infants, and Children program -- is allowing participants to use WIC vouchers for ready-to-feed infant formula, which does not need to be mixed with water.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re also allowing participants to swap the powdered formula that does require water for the ready-to-feed formula.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s sort of one example of how a federal program can be leveraged to try to meet the needs of the people in Flint.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more on the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s role in all this.\xc2\xa0 The critical issue seems to be when the water system was switched to the river system.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the EPA would have had to sign off on?\xc2\xa0 And are they -- what exactly is their -- is the administration satisfied that the EPA did everything that they should have been doing in this process?\xc2\xa0 Or is that also the focus of some of the investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to get into sort of dissecting the entire relationship between the state of Michigan and the EPA, primarily because this is a subject of ongoing discussion and investigation by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sort of get too far into the middle of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there surely is a role for the EPA to play to assist in the response effort, and there is expertise that the EPA can bring in terms of testing the water and the system, of conducting an audit of the system to determine which parts of it are safe and what can be done to make the system more safe.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this kind of scientific expertise can be valuable as they respond to the situation there in Michigan.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly is an important role the EPA will play.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That covers the response.\xc2\xa0 But what about the process?\xc2\xa0 Was there an EPA sign-off required for them to switch their water system?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if any sort of requirement like that was in place.\xc2\xa0 You can check with EPA, who may be able to tell you a little bit more about their system for working with state officials in these kinds of matters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, just to follow up on another question about that.\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton the other night framed this as a civil rights issue.\xc2\xa0 And the DOJ is involved in this.\xc2\xa0 Is that what they are looking at, whether this is a civil rights violation in some manner, as well as other violations that may have happened during the course of the decision making?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that this is actually a pretty specific inquiry into the circumstances that led to this situation that is now plaguing the people of Flint.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the Department of Justice whether or not that would include a consideration of the civil rights of the citizens of Flint being violated.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Byron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The Supreme Court is asking attorneys on both sides in the immigration case to argue a point about whether the President is violating his constitutional duty to \xe2\x80\x9ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Our Supreme Court reporter says it\xe2\x80\x99s rather unprecedented this this question is being litigated in the context of an executive power fight.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House worried that the Court might rebuke the administration\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive use of executive actions?\xc2\xa0 Or are you worried about anything else that this question portends?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I think the case that we will make is that these kinds of decisions about enforcement are well within the authority of the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 After all, these are the kinds of enforcement decisions that were also made by President Reagan and President H.W. Bush in the context of the Family Fairness program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is essentially a program that provided temporary relief and work authorization for up to 1.5 million people.\xc2\xa0 So this is way that the authority was exercised by President Reagan and the first President Bush.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with the way that President Obama has exercised his administration\xe2\x80\x99s authority in this matter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is a case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making since the day that we announced these executive actions.\xc2\xa0 There probably is a more technical legal argument that will be presented before the court, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll give our attorneys the opportunity to make that argument.\xc2\xa0 But just as a matter of common sense, and by consulting recent presidential history, we feel confident that there is a strong precedent that exists for this executive action.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us the general philosophy behind the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to immigration?\xc2\xa0 On one hand you have the administration offering to deportation relief -- that\'s at the center of the controversy that\'s in front of Court.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, you\'ve moved pretty aggressively to deport some Central Americans who were here.\xc2\xa0 Again, these are different groups and they\'re different circumstances, but what\xe2\x80\x99s the overall coherence or approach to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy about who gets to stay and who has to go?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple different ways to answer that question.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s gets repetitive, but it bears repeating.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we really want to solve the challenges of what is so obviously a broken immigration system, we need congressional legislation.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the most impactful comprehensive way for us to do the common-sense thing.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has pushed so hard for Congress to take that action.\xc2\xa0 And it continues to be a source of disappointment that House Republicans blocked a common-sense proposal to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So separate from the question about legislation, our approach has been to use as much of the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority, consistent with the law, to try to fix as many of the problems in that system as we can.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that we -- so one fact about the system is that because our system is broken, there are potentially millions of people inside the United States who have been in the country for years and are otherwise making a positive contribution to their community.\xc2\xa0 And they have -- they attend -- they send their kids to school alongside American children.\xc2\xa0 They attend religious services alongside other Americans.\xc2\xa0 They work in factories and other facilities alongside other Americans.\xc2\xa0 These are, in many cases, upstanding members of communities all across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And those are the individuals whose cases we believe need to be resolved consistent with our interests as a nation.\xc2\xa0 And the President does not believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest nor is it consistent with our values to go and tear those families apart.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What he actually does believe is in our national interest is that we need to bring some greater accountability to our broken immigration system and allow them to come out of the shadows, and allow them to be in a situation where they are paying taxes, where they are undergoing a background check, where they are learning English.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re trying to achieve.\xc2\xa0 And there are significant public safety, national security, and economic benefits associated with this action.\xc2\xa0 We have always said that we need to do more to secure the border.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the legislation that was defeated or blocked by House Republicans included an historic investment in border security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why we have said that people who have only recently crossed the border wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be prioritized or eligible for this kind of relief.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to set up a system that provides an incentive for individuals to flee violence in other countries and take a dangerous journey in their own right to try to come to the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with the United Nations to establish this separate process that would allow individuals in Guatemala and El Salvador and Honduras to petition the U.S. government consistent with a routinized process to get some humanitarian relief.\xc2\xa0 And they can do that without putting themselves in the hands of a human trafficker or otherwise taking a journey that has victimized too many innocent people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 You had the head of a prominent immigration rights group call the President the \xe2\x80\x9cDeporter in Chief.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, you have Republicans saying the President is handing out amnesty, wants amnesty.\xc2\xa0 These are rather different interpretations for actions by this administration.\xc2\xa0 What do you think the President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy on this issue will be, and how would you sum it up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think ultimately it will be historians who have the opportunity to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think historians will note that Republicans blocked a common-sense compromise proposal that this administration helped to craft in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And I think ultimately a lot of historians will say that, despite making this a top priority, the President was not able to do as much as he would have liked to have done to fix our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things that we certainly want to do is, in the face of congressional inaction, try to lay out a path to solve at least some of these problems.\xc2\xa0 And our proposed solution is one that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to aggressively defend before the courts.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Michelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton laid out the federal response to the situation, but obviously you know that there\xe2\x80\x99s this huge emotional reaction around the country and even beyond that it was something that potentially has lifelong effects and there\xe2\x80\x99s race and socioeconomics wrapped up in that.\xc2\xa0 So we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really heard from the President on this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard pretty forcefully from Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 Does he share that sense of outrage?\xc2\xa0 Or what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s feeling on this that this could even happen today?\xc2\xa0 And he is going to be in Detroit talking about progress in that city, where very nearby this other city hasn\xe2\x80\x99t experienced that, but then had this outrage heaped upon them.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you could really call it something else.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President is quite concerned about the impact that the situation is having on the tens of thousands of citizens of the city of Flint.\xc2\xa0 One thing it underscores is the importance of having good environmental laws on the books.\xc2\xa0 I know Republicans often like to describe these as job-killing regulations.\xc2\xa0 But as you point out, Michelle, the failure to properly enforce them, or what appears to be a situation in which they were not properly enforced, has grave consequences for the day-to-day lives of thousands of innocent Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these kinds of rules are important to our health and safety and to the wellbeing of our kids and the next generation of Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President feels strongly about that.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the President will next have the opportunity to talk about it, but it certainly is part of what he feels about this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he disturbed by the fact that this had been going on for such a long time?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far into this because there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing Department of Justice investigation.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President is determined to make sure that available resources within the administration can be used to support the state and local officials that are responding to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And in other reaction news, we heard from Secretary Kerry yesterday talking about when the U.S. sailors were released by Iran.\xc2\xa0 And looking at that video, I mean, he described it as feeling extremely upset, frustrated, and even angry when he saw that.\xc2\xa0 But around the same time that it was happening, what we generally heard from the administration was everything is working out fine and everybody cooperated and it was great.\xc2\xa0 And there just seems to be a disconnect in the way the Secretary viewed that situation versus how it was described early on.\xc2\xa0 So does the President share Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s initial assessment of how that video was shot and used?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\'t spoken to the President about the video.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the reaction of this administration was consistent with our strategy of securing the safe and prompt release of our sailors.\xc2\xa0 And there was a lot of second-guessing from our critics, some who have suggested that the full faith and -- or the full fury and anger of the United States should be felt by those who took the sailors into custody.\xc2\xa0 Others suggested that the President should somehow postpone the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, the fact is, none of that would have guaranteed the release of our sailors within 14 or 15 hours of originally going into custody.\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of rash, provocative reactions would have only made the situation worse and only would have made it harder for us to secure the safe return of our sailors, to say nothing of the implementation of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; to say nothing of the safe return of the five Americans who had been unjustly detained in Iran; and to say nothing of the resolution of some financial claims that were made by the Iranians that actually is going to allow the American taxpayers to save $6 or $7 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the outcome, obviously, was what everybody wanted.\xc2\xa0 But do you not see the way the Iranians handled this as provocative and exploitive?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what is clear is that because of diplomacy, the United States government was able to secure promptly the return of our sailors who had been taken into custody.\xc2\xa0 And those are just the facts.\xc2\xa0 That is an approach that I think has served the American people and our national security quite well.\xc2\xa0 That has not prevented our critics from making rash claims about the President\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, but I actually think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to absorb those claims and pursue tough, principled diplomacy is probably the strongest endorsement of his strength and toughness that you could look for.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, on Levinson.\xc2\xa0 Over the weekend, it was talked about by the administration that there was progress.\xc2\xa0 Do you see that progress as meaning primarily that the communication is open?\xc2\xa0 Or do you have some other indication that either Iran knows his whereabouts?\xc2\xa0 I guess another way of asking would be, what is your confidence level that Iran can actually still be helpful in this situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what we have secured as a result of this agreement is a commitment on the part of the Iranians to use the diplomatic channel that\'s been opened to continue to engage with the United States about the whereabouts of Mr. Levinson.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to hold the Iranians to that commitment, and we\'re going to continue to make it a priority to try to determine his whereabouts and bring him home.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to be focused on that moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, look, there are some indications that Mr. Levinson may no longer be in Iran, and that may raise questions about what Iran can do to actually bring him home.\xc2\xa0 But what we\'re looking for right now is information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to press the Iranians on that accordingly as a result of this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you feel that they are using him as leverage?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\'s hard to arrive at that conclusion until we have more information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to press the Iranians for more information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to try again on CBO.\xc2\xa0 A week ago, the President was boasting about bringing the deficit down by three-quarters.\xc2\xa0 Now CBO says that trend is turning around, largely because of the decisions that Congress made, the President signed off on to raise the spending caps and extend the tax breaks.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see that as a problem?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Scott, just as a factual matter, the consequences for the tax policy decisions and not paying for those tax breaks has far bigger fiscal consequences than the spending decisions that are incorporated into that budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 The President would have preferred that Congress do the responsible thing and only enact those tax cuts and paying for them by closing loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and well-connected.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is a case that we have made on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 That would have been not just the fairer thing to do, it would have been better for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It also would have improved the fiscal situation of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, look, these kinds of agreements are a compromise, and we said that even as the President was signing the legislation.\xc2\xa0 What the President, though, moving forward, Scott, will lay out is a budget proposal that properly invests in our national security priorities and in our economic priorities, particularly when it comes to expanding economic opportunity for the middle class, but doing so in a fiscally responsible way.\xc2\xa0 And everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate the strategy that the President puts forward, and it certainly will be consistent with our goal of keeping our deficits under the 3 percent threshold that would allow us to stabilize our debt as a percentage of GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So will the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget show continued decline in the deficit as a percentage of GDP?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stay tuned.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, obviously the families of the Americans released are happy to have their loved ones home.\xc2\xa0 But coinciding with the billion-dollar payment, coinciding with the nuclear deal, what do you say to those even within your own administration who worry that this puts a price on the head of every American?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve made clear that this is a one-time proposition.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the circumstances, as you just laid them out, are quite unique.\xc2\xa0 And what the President did was he used tough, principled diplomacy to bring our citizens home.\xc2\xa0 And if there are those -- if our critics disagree with that, then they should have the courage to stand up and say so, and say it would be better for the United States for those individuals, those innocent Americans, to remain in an Iranian prison.\xc2\xa0 If that\'s what they believe, they should have the courage of their convictions to say so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s view here on hostage policy and prisoner policy?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it appears that this swap is different from those in the past, and it also appears that that was the case with Cuba.\xc2\xa0 I mean, in both cases, Iran and Cuba, this was not prisoner for prisoner alone; it coincided with a much bigger policy shift and change.\xc2\xa0 So it appears that there is a policy link between taking Americans hostage, or prisoner, and it leading to some other kind of inroad with the administration to pursue other things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me try to explain to you how we see it.\xc2\xa0 I think there is a connection generally.\xc2\xa0 Each of these situations is so different.\xc2\xa0 But I think there is one of general thing that you can draw from this, which is the President believes that there are a variety of benefits associated with engaging with countries around the world, even those with whom we vigorously disagree.\xc2\xa0 And by more deeply engaging with those countries, we don\xe2\x80\x99t give them a free pass.\xc2\xa0 We certainly continue to, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned earlier, institute sanctions against Iran for their continued development of their ballistic missile program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Cuba, you continue to hear the administration be quite harshly critical of the human rights conditions inside that country.\xc2\xa0 But deeper engagement with those two countries has allowed the United States to advance our interests, including securing the release of innocent Americans who are being unjustly held in those two countries.\xc2\xa0 That is a pretty strong endorsement of tough, principled, diplomatic engagement.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the other thing is, in each case, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also derived other benefits.\xc2\xa0 Of the Iranians, we\xe2\x80\x99ve succeeded in building an international coalition to shut down every pathway they have to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 We resolved a longstanding financial claim that put taxpayers on the hook for potentially billions of dollars, according to claims that the Iranians themselves had made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to Cuba, what we have actually succeeded in doing is transforming the relationship between the United States and countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 No longer is our effort to isolate Cuba an impediment to our ability to form deep and important relationships with countries throughout the Western Hemisphere.\xc2\xa0 Those strengthened relationships doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just benefit the United States, it also has the added benefit of getting people to focus less on the relationship between Cuban and the United States, but rather on the relationship between the Cuban government and the Cuban people, and to focus more attention and more pressure on the Cuban government to do a better job of protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the administration thinks it got more than it gave in both cases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We surely believe that -- that the result of this diplomacy, particularly when it comes to just focusing on Iran here, the United States accomplished significant objectives that, again, even our allies, some of whom are critical of this agreement, have long identified preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon as a top national security priority.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, when the President took office in 2009, Iran was accelerating their nuclear program in the direction of developing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the international community was at a loss with how to deal with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince that time, President Obama has stood up, organized the international community to impose these tough sanctions on Iran, compelled Iran to come to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Iran do now is follow through on commitments that they made at that negotiating table to essentially assure us that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a path to developing a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is remarkable progress in the space of just less than seven years, and represent a significant advancement in the national security interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you could also look at it and say, look, these secret talks only began in the first place because Iran took three hikers hostage many years ago, and then that led to the path of diplomacy, and then this coincides in finality with another prisoner swap.\xc2\xa0 I mean, some look at that and say Iran has made a successful business of taking hostages and prisoners, and the United States responded by brokering this deal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually think this started when the President stood on the steps of the United States Capitol on January 20th, 2009 and said that if Iran is prepared to engage in conversations with the United States and to do so peacefully in an effort to try to achieve our collective goals, that the United States would engage.\xc2\xa0 And that was a controversial notion at the time.\xc2\xa0 When the President was talking about this on the campaign trail, he was criticized for it.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes strongly that this is the best way to advance the interests of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And I think if you take a look at the results seven years later, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty difficult to say that he was wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. just issued a report -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to look at it or not -- but it has staggering statistics of 19,000 civilians dead between January 2014 and October 2015; 36,000 wounded; almost 3 million displaced.\xc2\xa0 Now, the President described ISIS -- most of them are committed by ISIS.\xc2\xa0 The President described them as a bunch of killers with good social media tools.\xc2\xa0 And this report is saying that basically these crimes could be crimes against humanity, and possibly they could be charged with genocide.\xc2\xa0 How do you square these two --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what you -- the President has been unsparing in describing the horrific tactics and actions of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And, again, there is a reason that the President has stepped forward and built an international coalition of 65 nations to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that our coalition has taken some 9,000 airstrikes -- 9,500 airstrikes against ISIL targets in Iraq and in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we are very focused on implementing a coordinated, integrated strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The reason -- the thing that prompted U.S. involvement in this matter in the first place was the willingness of ISIL figures to carry out atrocities against innocent Iraqi citizens.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that in August of 2014, the first airstrikes that were carried out by the United States against ISIL targets included strikes against ISIL figures that were preparing to slaughter innocent Yazidis at Mount Sinjar.\xc2\xa0 So the President has led the effort against ISIL in no small part because he is quite concerned about the kind of violence that they\xe2\x80\x99ve perpetrated on innocent people throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- his critics, Josh, I know you know that very well, they criticize the President as not taking them seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I think -- I recognize that that is something that our critics regularly say, but it flies in the face of all of the facts about what we have done to degrade and ultimately destroy that terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 The amount of territory that they control inside of Iraq has been significantly reduced.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also made progress in driving them out of some populated areas in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJust to give you sort of the most recent example, the Department of Defense has recently released footage of millions of dollars held by ISIL being destroyed in an airstrike.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked in here about how critically important it is for us to shut down ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s financing, because they\xe2\x80\x99re not just trying to organize terrorist acts around the world; they\xe2\x80\x99re also trying to occupy and govern land.\xc2\xa0 And so if we can shut off their financing, we can choke off the lifeblood of that organization.\xc2\xa0 And strikes like the one the Department of Defense announced over the weekend I think are a good indication of how we are integrating our counter-financing efforts with our military efforts.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re making important progress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also are going to continue to be mindful of the homeland security threat that ISIL poses.\xc2\xa0 And over the holidays, the last couple of weeks in December, the United States and our coalition partners carried out airstrikes that resulted in the death of 10 ISIL figures, including at least one that had connections to the network that carried out the terrorist attacks in Paris and included others who were helping to support efforts to plan attacks in other places, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even as we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the terrible atrocities that are committed by ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99re also mindful of the threat that they pose to innocent human beings outside of that region of the world.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s bold action when it comes to leading a coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL is indicative of how serious he understands this threat is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 Any update on the missing Americans -- three of them -- and it all falls into the criticism by the Republicans that basically any prisoner exchange will encourage other groups, militias or whatever, to kidnap more Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nadia, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen those reports but there\xe2\x80\x99s very little that I can say about these reports at this point.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that U.S. officials have been in touch with Iraqi officials about those reports, but there\xe2\x80\x99s not much more that I can say about the situation beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Iran and leverage.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked a couple times about the nature of the way in which these five detainees were negotiated around.\xc2\xa0 Has the White House essentially -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve described this as the -- this was happening parallel and that this was a unique opportunity alongside the nuclear talks.\xc2\xa0 Was this the last chance, the last window for the United States to exercise that kind of leverage?\xc2\xa0 Or should -- I guess to the other side of this, to manage expectations, should we be expecting other areas that the United States has conflict with Iran to essentially fall by the wayside because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that kind of leverage anymore?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the way that I would describe it, Jared, is that we capitalized on an opportunity that had been presented to try to advance our interests and secure the release of these innocent Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s only because, frankly, that in the context of the nuclear talks every single time, once those talks were concluded, American negotiators would remind their Iranian counterparts that there was another significant priority that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been discussed, which is the case of innocent Americans.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s only because of that persistence did the Iranians agree to establish a separate, parallel track where their release could be negotiated.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, what we have been clear about since the beginning, even when we were being criticized for not securing the release of these Americans by our harshest critics, is that this nuclear agreement was not predicated on a dramatic change in Iranian behavior.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s because we know that Iran is supporting terrorism, threatening Israel, engaging in other destabilizing activities in the region -- principally in Syria and Yemen -- and developing a ballistic missile program that we needed to make preventing them from getting a nuclear weapon a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s what we did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIf there are additional diplomatic opportunities that are presented, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can use diplomacy to advance our interests.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule that out.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that with anything in mind.\xc2\xa0 But of course, if there are additional opportunities for us to resolve issues that benefit the United States, then we\'re going to capitalize on them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what we\'re not going to do is we\'re certainly not going to paper over the concerns that we have with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s malign activities in the region.\xc2\xa0 And I think the decision that was announced over the weekend to impose sanctions on individuals and entities connected to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missile program is a good example of that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess with the implementation day in the rearview mirror, though, is it reasonable to say that the United States leverage -- so if the high-water mark is these five detainees and ballistic missiles clearly above that, since Iran was willing to exacerbate its own activities over the weekend, is there anything that you can say is still being worked on as actively as those detainees were over the past few months?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, one thing that will continue is the way that we will continue to press the case of Mr. Levinson and to press Iranian officials for information about his whereabouts.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the thing that comes most directly in mind.\xc2\xa0 But what -- the other breakthrough here has been the demonstration that principled diplomacy can allow the governments of both countries to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll look for additional opportunities to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olivier, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you that last one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I take two?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Margaret, Jon, and Nadia have all asked you to directly reject one of your critics\xe2\x80\x99 central points, which is that this sets up an incentive structure to take more Americans prisoner.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve defended the administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach, but you haven\xe2\x80\x99t directly tackled that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard you directly tackle that.\xc2\xa0 Could you do that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess what I would say is it\xe2\x80\x99s not distant or ancient American history that President Reagan acknowledged on live television that he had traded arms for hostages.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard a lot of Republican criticism of that.\xc2\xa0 So maybe they are so reflexively committed to defending those kinds of actions that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for them to consider what could be gained from a humanitarian release of nonviolent individuals, most of whom are American citizens, by the way, in the United States to secure the release of innocent Americans that were being detained by Iran.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think if you consider the history here, the President\xe2\x80\x99s effective use of diplomacy withstands a lot of scrutiny in a way that, frankly, their claims don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, in the State of the Union, the President talked about the low price of gas, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a growing chorus of economists that he\xe2\x80\x99s expressing concern that low oil prices might actually have negative knock-on effects on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Do you share those concerns?\xc2\xa0 If so, to what extent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s point in the State of the Union was to note that American middle-class families who are filling up the tank in the car once or twice a week are enjoying significant benefits to their household income as a result of the low price of gas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, there are a variety of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 Some of that has to do with the fact that cars are more efficient than they -- are getting more efficient than they have been before.\xc2\xa0 Some of that is a result of the level of production of the oil and gas on American soil.\xc2\xa0 And some of that is also a reflection of weakness in other countries\xe2\x80\x99 markets.\xc2\xa0 So there are a variety of factors here, and I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s allusion here is that a lot of the criticism that the administration gets is related to how middle-class families don\xe2\x80\x99t benefit from the energy policy that this administration has put in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, right now, middle-class families are benefitting from that policy and we want to make sure that our policy reflects not just those pocketbook concerns but also reflects the need for us to invest in growing industries, including the renewable energy industry, which will create jobs and economic opportunity for middle-class families that can\xe2\x80\x99t be exported.\xc2\xa0 We also want to be looking out for the best interests of the planet and for public health.\xc2\xa0 And all of that is consistent with a policy of transitioning our economy to a low-carbon economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is a long-term goal, one that will not be accomplished before the end of this administration and probably not going to be accomplished by the end of the next administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But starting that planning now will allow the United States to maximize the upside potential, including when it comes to creating good, middle-class jobs of the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:26 P.M.
