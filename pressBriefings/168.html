Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t*Please see below for addenda to the transcript, marked with asterisks.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:47 P.M EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Friday. \xc2\xa0I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m staring in a room full of people who are happily not getting on a plane to Asia in the next 24 hours. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Some are only doing the Turkey leg.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0Except for me, and at least one of my colleagues here today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we go to your questions, I just wanted to do one thing at the top that is relevant to both an activity that the President will be engaged in later this afternoon, but also a good preview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities over the course of the next week.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater this afternoon, the President will convene a meeting here at the White House where he will be joined by a bipartisan group of some of the most prominent voices in national security and diplomacy in both parties to discuss the strategic importance of setting the rules of the road for global trade in the Asia Pacific. \xc2\xa0Participants in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting include Secretaries of State who have served Presidents in both parties, including Madeleine Albright, James Baker, Henry Kissinger, and Colin Powell. \xc2\xa0The meeting will also include former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, and former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe group will discuss how high-standards trade agreements, like the recently negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership, can bolster the U.S. economy at home and strengthen our relationships abroad by uniting countries in one of the fastest-growing regions of the world under a set of common values and principles. \xc2\xa0These principles will promote inclusive development and level the playing field for businesses and workers here in the United States. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted before, the rules of the road in Asia are up for grabs, and there is a lot of concern and even some complaints expressed by people in both parties about how U.S. influence when it comes to the economy, but also when it comes to our strategic interests, are in competition with China. \xc2\xa0And in the mind of the President -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say this before -- in the mind of the President, the question really is, what are we going to do about it. \xc2\xa0And in the mind of the President, the question of what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do about it is we\xe2\x80\x99re going to sign trade agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with other countries in the region about setting higher standards and leveling the playing field for American businesses and American workers in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s good for the U.S. economy and capitalizes on the opportunity that exists in the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0And this has long-term ramifications for the strength of the U.S. economy and the influence that the United States exercises around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to hear a lot more from us and from the President on this over the course of his trip to Asia, where the President will certainly be talking about the importance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President will actually be meeting with the leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership member nations on this trip. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will also have the opportunity to talk about the importance of ensuring that the South China Sea remains open to the free flow of commerce and the freedom of navigation, and will give him the opportunity to underscore the ties that the United States maintains with other countries in the region to help them protect their interests in the region, but also to reinforce our view that any disputes in the region, including territorial disputes, should be resolved through diplomacy and, frankly, should not be resolved by larger countries throwing their weight around.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this will -- obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk about this not just later today, but also over the course of the trip. \xc2\xa0And the reason this is significant -- and many of you have spent a lot of years covering this already, but I would anticipate that over the course of the next year you\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested in talking about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy priorities have been since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office and what kind of opportunities that will create for the United States in the future and for the next President, regardless of which candidate is elected to that job.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd seizing the opportunities that exist in Asia for the United States, and deepening our relationships with our allies, including the Philippines and South Korea and Japan, but also other countries with whom we have important relationships, like Malaysia and Vietnam and others, is an important part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s view about the best way to protect the national security interests of the United States and to strengthen our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President at the end of his meeting today talking about this a little bit. \xc2\xa0But the President is doing a couple news conferences over the course of this trip, and I think the President will be eager to talk to you more about it then as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that long windup, Darlene, let\xe2\x80\x99s get going on this Friday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Do you have anything to add to the Pentagon saying it\xe2\x80\x99s reasonably certain that \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John\xe2\x80\x9d is dead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene, at this point, what I can confirm for you is that U.S. forces conducted an airstrike in Raqqa, Syria yesterday, our time, that targeted Mohammed Emwazi. \xc2\xa0Mr. Emwazi was a British citizen who is best known in this country for his participation in the death of some Western hostages, including some American citizens. \xc2\xa0Mr. Emwazi was an ISIL leader. \xc2\xa0He was a strategist for that organization. \xc2\xa0And he was intimately involved in the effort by ISIL to recruit individuals to their cause. \xc2\xa0And so his ability to use social media to inspire and radicalize people around the globe meant that he was making a valuable contribution to ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm the results of that operation. \xc2\xa0Confirmation of the results of that operation will be shared with all of you by the Department of Defense once they have had the opportunity to take a close look at what exactly occurred. \xc2\xa0And there is a very rigorous process for assessing these outcomes. \xc2\xa0And so any final determination about this will be issued by the Department of Defense, but the fact is, a final determination has not been made at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The British Prime Minister described the strike today as \xe2\x80\x9can act of self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you have any idea what he meant by that. \xc2\xa0And is that how the U.S. would characterize the airstrike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the entirety of Prime Minister Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to his office for an explanation. \xc2\xa0But certainly the role that Mr. Emwazi has played in radicalizing individuals around the world and inspiring individuals to join their cause made him a threat not just to the region but to countries around the world. \xc2\xa0And I would just note that this airstrike that has gotten, understandably, a fair amount of attention here in this country is consistent with a number of other operations that the United States military has carried out inside of Syria against leading ISIL figures. \xc2\xa0Earlier this summer, we noted that an ISIL senior leader named Abu Bakr al-Turkmani, who was described by some people as the number two in ISIL, was killed in a coalition airstrike in Iraq. \xc2\xa0There were other external fighters; Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin were killed in an airstrike -- a coalition airstrike in August, near Raqqa. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is consistent with the kinds of operations that the President and our coalition partners have -- well, that the President ordered and that the United States and our coalition partners have carried out against ISIL leaders. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with our broader -- with the broader military component of our counter-ISIL strategy to apply significant pressure to ISIL leaders. \xc2\xa0And that has yielded, in some cases, important intelligence that can be exploited. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also serves the purpose of ensuring that those ISIL leaders are devoting a significant amount of their time to their own security. \xc2\xa0And that is less time then that they can devote to ensuring that their operation can run successfully and that, frankly, that they can devote to plots and plans that they may be considering against Western targets.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Switching topics. \xc2\xa0Is there any comment or reaction from the White House to the latest allegation of misconduct against a Secret Service agent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Darlene, I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of those reports. \xc2\xa0Obviously, from reading the reports, the allegations included in them are disgusting and allegations that the administration, including the Secret Service, takes quite seriously. \xc2\xa0I think the fact that as soon as the Secret Service became aware of this information, that they acted, is an indication of how seriously they take this matter. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m unable and unwilling to comment much more about a personnel matter. \xc2\xa0For additional details, you can check in with the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One last question. \xc2\xa0Are you aware that Ben Carson said earlier today that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be releasing evidence that he has of China\xe2\x80\x99s military involvement in Syria, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to share that with the White House before the weekend is over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Someone did tell me that he said that earlier today. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s not common that -- maybe it violates my job description as a spokesperson to be speechless, but I think in this case I am. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a way to sort of characterize the importance of this airstrike on this individual in the overall fight against Islamic State?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think, Roberta, what I would -- the way that I would describe it to you is I think it is clear evidence that we are making important progress on one element of our strategy, which is to apply pressure to the ISIL leadership, and to capitalize on available intelligence to advance our goals. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I say all of this without the Department of Defense having rendered a final assessment about the results of this particular action. \xc2\xa0But the fact that we are even able to conduct this airstrike I think is some indication that we are serious about applying pressure to ISIL leaders and to using that intelligence to do that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, in the case of Mr. Emwazi, somebody who is an ISIL leader, a strategist for that organization, and somebody who was actively involved in their online recruitment and radicalization efforts -- and that made him a target worth going after.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And as you mentioned earlier, this individual had a role in the deaths of some Western hostages. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the White House has reached out today or yesterday to the families of those hostages, and if you could describe I guess what kind of outreach was done for them sort of leading up to this.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Roberta, I can confirm that a number of families of hostages who have been killed in Syria were contacted in advance of public reports to let them know that this operation had taken place. \xc2\xa0The reason for that is simply that when these kinds of operations take place, it once again elevates the media attention around their loved one. \xc2\xa0And so hearing from us firsthand about that is something that we try to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was something that was done consistent with the process that was established by the task force that the President announced earlier today -- or earlier this year, over the summer, to talk about how the United States will handle the cases of American hostages that are being held around the world. \xc2\xa0One of the goals of that new structure was to streamline and improve our communication with hostage families, and -- or the families of hostages. \xc2\xa0And this is one example of how that process has been made more efficient by the structure that we have put in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And briefly on this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, the bipartisan meeting that you\xe2\x80\x99re having on TPP -- how concerned is the White House and the President that the TPP is becoming kind of a target of bipartisan criticism in the 2016 campaign, with both Democrats involved in the campaign and people -- Republicans who are running sort of attacking it from both sides?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not particularly -- again, primarily because this was -- when Congress was working to advance trade promotion authority legislation over the summer -- something that did not enjoy bipartisan support on the campaign trail -- but yet we were able to succeed in building bipartisan support for that legislation on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0If anything, we believe that our case is strengthened by the fact that we have a final agreement that includes, for example, 18,000 tax cuts. \xc2\xa0I think that will make our case even more persuasive to members of Congress who actually have a vote on the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I also think that the meeting that the President will convene today with national security experts in both parties serves as a useful illustration that when you set aside politics, the benefits of an agreement like this are significant and wide-ranging, and extend even beyond the strong economic argument that we have to make. \xc2\xa0The concerns that some of even our critics have expressed about our ability to protect our interest in the Asia Pacific region, particularly when it comes to the growing influence of China and the growing size of China\xe2\x80\x99s economy, I think have to acknowledge that this strategy for continuing to advance our interests is one that has bipartisan support by -- frankly, among people who know best. \xc2\xa0And that merits mentioning on the eve of a trip where the President was going to spend a lot of time talking about this strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First on the strike in Syria. \xc2\xa0Were the Special Ops forces that the President authorized in the last month at all involved either in tracking this individual down or in calling in the airstrike anywhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0For the operational role, Justin, that may have been played by our Special Operations forces, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0My understanding about what took place, however, is that this is -- that this airstrike that was conducted within the last 24 hours is consistent with the kinds of airstrikes that have been taking place targeting ISIL leaders over the last several months. \xc2\xa0But for the details, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DOD.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President spoke earlier today with French President Hollande. \xc2\xa0Obviously, earlier this week, there seemed to be a bit of a split. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry said the Paris talks weren\xe2\x80\x99t going to have a binding treaty, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been your guys\xe2\x80\x99 stated preference for a long time. \xc2\xa0Well, Hollande said that a legally binding treaty would be necessary for there to even be an agreement coming out of Paris. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the two leaders were able to bridge that gap at all in their conversation today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details to share with you about the specific nature of their conversation. \xc2\xa0As I said yesterday, our expectation is that we hope that the meeting in Paris can serve to lock in significant commitments from countries around the world to fighting climate change and cutting carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0And part of that discussion will center on transparency and accountability -- not just making those commitments, but how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to demonstrate compliance with those commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd all of this will be the subject of the negotiations that are scheduled to take place over 10 or 11 days in Paris. \xc2\xa0So I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample opportunity to sit down at the negotiating table and hammer out these agreements. \xc2\xa0But our expectation is that the kinds of commitments that people will make will be significant and that they will be verifiable and transparent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And lastly the President met with a number of Catholic leaders earlier this morning. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can read out what that meeting was about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Justin, this was a meeting that was scheduled with some of the Catholic leaders here in the United States to follow up on Pope Francis\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the White House earlier this fall. \xc2\xa0It was a private meeting so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to share with you. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that it was the President\xe2\x80\x99s intent to go into that meeting discussing the wide range of areas where there\xe2\x80\x99s common ground that is shared by the administration and by the Catholic Church when it comes to some priorities. \xc2\xa0Those priorities include things like climate change, immigration reform. \xc2\xa0Certainly our diplomatic efforts in Iran and Cuba would fall in this category. \xc2\xa0Broader issues related to social justice are priorities of the Catholic Church and are priorities that are shared by the administration and there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to work together to advance them and that merits some discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tChip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Could you give us a sense of the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in this strike in Syria? \xc2\xa0Did he give the final order? \xc2\xa0Did he follow it from the Situation Room? \xc2\xa0What was his reaction when it happened? \xc2\xa0How closely did he monitor it? \xc2\xa0Was it anything remotely like the killing of Osama bin Laden and his involvement in that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It was not. \xc2\xa0It was different than that. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned earlier, there are a number of strikes that have been carried out by the United States and our coalition partners over the last several months against leading ISIL figures in Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0There are also a number of strikes, by the way, that have been carried out against other al Qaeda figures in Syria as well because of the threat that they pose to the United States and our interests. \xc2\xa0So the Department of Defense has been given orders by the Commander-in-Chief to implement this military strategy that includes conducting airstrikes against ISIL leaders. \xc2\xa0And this operation was carried out consistent with those parameters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he make it clear at any point that he wanted them to go after Emwazi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0These kinds of -- I think it was quite clear to the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team that people who could be described as ISIL leaders and strategists and certainly individuals that play a prominent role in designing an online recruitment strategy are individuals who merit inclusion on a list of people to go after.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And are you aware of his reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of his reaction. \xc2\xa0I have not spoken to him about this particular issue today. \xc2\xa0I know that he was briefed yesterday on it and presumably he received an update today on the current assessment about the outcome of the operation. \xc2\xa0At this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no final determination that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached and no final determination that was shared with the President about the outcome of the mission. \xc2\xa0But he got an update on what information is known about the results.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In your statement, you used the word \xe2\x80\x9cwas\xe2\x80\x9d -- that Emwazi was --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I noticed that, too. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to adjust the verb tense to sort of account for exactly this individual\xe2\x80\x99s current status because no final determination has been made about his current status.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You were not confirming his death?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did not intend to implicitly do that by choosing the past tense.</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Gardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The subjunctive is best when there\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainty. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a follow-up. \xc2\xa0So did the President have to approve specifically this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This did not rise to the level of an operation that would require presidential approval. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the parameters that the President has previously laid out for the Department of Defense when these kinds of operations should take place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did he know this was going to happen in advance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President was briefed on this yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Before it happened?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The timing of that briefing -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly when that occurred, but the President was briefed on this yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t**[The President was briefed on the strike after the operation had taken place.]\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether it was before or after the strike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was before or after the strike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, could you check on that for us?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I will check on it, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And obviously \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John\xe2\x80\x9d had personally taunted the President in those awful videos, mentioning him by name, said he had an arrogant policy -- foreign policy towards ISIS. \xc2\xa0Does he take any personal satisfaction in his likely demise? \xc2\xa0I mean, obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a strategic satisfaction, there\xe2\x80\x99s justice, but is there any kind of personal satisfaction the President takes in that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not based on Mr. Emwazi\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the President. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the President spent a lot of time focused on those particular comments. \xc2\xa0I think what the President takes some satisfaction in is knowing that the kind of strategy that the Department of Defense has laid out and that he has approved and that his national security team has carefully worked on over the last several months is showing some signs of progress. \xc2\xa0And these kinds of -- again, even the fact that we could take a strike like this is an indication that we are able to gather useful intelligence and try to advance our goals in that way. \xc2\xa0But there are other areas that we can point to just in the last 24 hours that give us some confidence. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of news out of Sinjar in the last 24 hours about the progress that Kurdish fighters are making in that -- in Iraq. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s important because that, again, is also a reflection of some progress that our strategy is yielding. \xc2\xa0The progress that the Peshmerga are making in those operations have been facilitated by coalition airstrikes that were taken in advance and in concert with their efforts on the ground. \xc2\xa0It also shows the benefits of the investment that we have made in that fighting force that has been an effective partner with the United States and our broader coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is some preliminary progress to report about Iraqi forces taking the fight to ISIL in the vicinity of Ramadi. \xc2\xa0Ramadi has obviously been a place that\xe2\x80\x99s been characterized by a lot of back and forth. \xc2\xa0So obviously we are cautious about making grand pronouncements about that. \xc2\xa0But any encouraging report is one that we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think at the same time that you sort of have this confluence of events that show some progress in Iraq and in Syria against ISIL, we continue to be mindful of the President\xe2\x80\x99s admonition that any sort of military conflict like this will be characterized by areas of progress and periods of setback. \xc2\xa0And we certainly have spent time talking about the periods of setback, as we should. \xc2\xa0Those are something that we should acknowledge. \xc2\xa0But there are also days like today where we\xe2\x80\x99re showing some progress, and that warrants mentioning as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you see the statement from James Foley\xe2\x80\x99s family?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen parts of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It said that they -- if only so much effort had been given to finding and rescuing Jim and the other hostages who were subsequently murdered by ISIS they might be alive today. \xc2\xa0They said they took little solace in this news.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, Jon, if I had been through -- experienced the kind of personal loss and grief that they have over the last 18 months or so, I think I might feel the same way. \xc2\xa0I think their reaction is perfectly understandable. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that this is an operation that was carried out because of the role that Mr. Emwazi had played in -- the leading role that he played inside that organization. \xc2\xa0And part of our strategy to apply significant pressure to that leadership for the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99ve described and that was the reason for the operation and, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- given the grief that they have felt, I can understand why they take little solace in it. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a perfectly understandable perspective for them to express.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And a quick follow-up on the Secret Service. \xc2\xa0Was the President informed of this arrest? \xc2\xa0How concerned is he about the fact that apparently a sexual predator, alleged sexual predator was working right here on the White House grounds with Secret Service? \xc2\xa0Does he still have confidence in Director Clancy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, the way that I understand the chain of events that took place is that as soon as the Secret Service learned of these allegations, they acted quickly to take away this individual\xe2\x80\x99s security clearance, to take away Secret Service equipment, and to prevent their continued access to sensitive areas, including the White House. \xc2\xa0Shortly after those steps were taken, the White House was informed. \xc2\xa0And I think the prompt and decisive action that was taken by the leadership of the United States Secret Service I think is an endorsement of their commitment to implementing the kinds of reforms that are needed at the Secret Service to ensure that that agency continues to live up to the high standard that they\xe2\x80\x99ve established for themselves.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we saw that high standard on display when the agency as a whole had to take on the significant challenge of protecting world leaders from around the world, including the Pope, the Chinese President and the hundreds of world leaders who were in attendance at the United Nations General Assembly. \xc2\xa0That, I think, is a strong performance by the agency, and I think an indication that that is an agency that is both well-managed, but also stocked with professionals who are committed to their job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President continues to have confidence in Director Clancy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Without a doubt. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0James.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0The remarks out of the Defense Department this morning regarding this airstrike are that -- are to the effect that the Pentagon is reasonably certain that the individual known at \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John\xe2\x80\x9d was killed; that it\xe2\x80\x99s 99 percent certain. \xc2\xa0You do not dispute those characterizations of certainty, do you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t dispute the latest assessment that the Department of Defense has shared publicly. \xc2\xa0I would just note that that does not reflect a final assessment based on a rigorous process that the Department of Defense has in place for evaluating these kinds of operations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But all appearances right now suggest that he was killed, correct?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information to contradict the latest assessment that has been shared by the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d just caution you to note that this does not reflect the final assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just prior to the 2012 Democratic National Convention that re-nominated President Obama for a second term, there appeared in the New York Times what appeared to be an authorized leak averring to the existence of a so-called kill list of terrorists overseas which President Obama was said, as Commander-in-Chief, to personally review and approve or decline the individuals on that list for targeting. \xc2\xa0Did \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John\xe2\x80\x9d appear on this kill list?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I can tell you, James, is -- I remember that story, and it obviously is something that has been talked about quite a bit over the years. \xc2\xa0I certainly can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm whether or not that was the result of a so-called authorized leak. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can tell you about this specific operation that did target Mr. Emwazi is that it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kind of operations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve carried out over the last several months against other ISIL leaders, and it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the parameters that the President has established for the Department of Defense as they carry out this aspect of our strategy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to the level of needing a specific presidential sign-off before this kind of operation was carried out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It was, if memory serves, on September 9th, 2014 that President Obama delivered his primetime address laying out his multi-pronged strategy for confronting ISIS. \xc2\xa0Accounting for the fact that he said at that time, and many senior officials have reaffirmed since then, that this is going to be a long process, one that will extend beyond the duration of the President\xe2\x80\x99s own term, that there will be periods, as you just said to us earlier of progress and setback. \xc2\xa0Accounting for all of those things, is the President pleased with the pace of the anti-ISIL effort since he announced it on September 9th, 2014?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0James, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that everybody who is paying any attention to this -- and I think this is probably the -- includes the vast majority of Americans -- would like to see this be moving faster. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s not is a reflection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the United States cannot merely impose a military solution on the problems that are plaguing Iraq and Syria; that ultimately what the United States can do and must do is build the capacity of the central government in Iraq and build the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to protect their own country. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously got a lot of work to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Syria, the situation is a little bit different. \xc2\xa0We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a central government with whom we can coordinate. \xc2\xa0We have to rely on trying to build the capacity of local fighters and looking for organizations with whom we can work to take the fight to ISIL on the ground. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the point here is simply that any time you see these kinds of conflicts, you want them to be resolved more quickly, primarily because we know that there are lives being lost, and certainly millions of innocent lives that are being disrupted as people flee violence from Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if it could be resolved more quickly, we certainly would welcome that. \xc2\xa0But I also think at the same time there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing important progress as a result of the strategy that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, by and large, the President thinks this effort is going about as well as it reasonably could be expected to go.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that -- noting that there will be periods of progress and periods of setback, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that important progress has been yielded. \xc2\xa0But we sure have a long way to go when it comes to ultimately achieving our goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL, but also trying to address the underlying political challenges that have plagued both Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tIraq is substantially further along in addressing those problems, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve got some work to do, too. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that work with the support of the United States. \xc2\xa0In Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a much longer row to hoe here. \xc2\xa0And Secretary Kerry is at the forefront of that effort. \xc2\xa0He has, over the course of today, been leading diplomatic discussions in Vienna to try to get started on that work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0Is it safe to say then when it\xe2\x80\x99s all said and done and he\xe2\x80\x99s writing his memoirs in the future, Barack Obama is going to look back on Syria and say, the way his administration handled this conflict was the worst set of decisions he made, the greatest blemish on his presidency, the equivalent of what Rwanda was for Bill Clinton?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that will be his conclusion. \xc2\xa0I do think that former President Obama is likely to be in a situation where he writes that Syria was one of the most challenging foreign policy situations that his administration had to confront, but that we succeeded in doing so mindful of the lessons of the recent history, and mindful of the need to ensure that the national security interests of the United States aren\xe2\x80\x99t just protected but advanced. \xc2\xa0And as difficult as this scenario has been, I think our efforts with regard to Syria thus far would pass those two tests.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Back on TPP. \xc2\xa0We learned Secretary Vilsack is going to be traveling to Japan to talk to the agriculture minister there. \xc2\xa0Is there a particular problem or -- what is the purpose or goal of that trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Cheryl, I have to admit, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been briefed on Secretary Vilsack\xe2\x80\x99s trip. \xc2\xa0I know that he frequently travels overseas because the U.S. agriculture sector in some ways has as much to gain as anybody else in the United States -- I guess as any sector in the U.S. economy does from this trade agreement. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of markets throughout the Asia Pacific that will be opened up to American agriculture exports. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a really good thing for the U.S. economy, and it certainly is a good thing for the rural economy here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that Secretary Vilsack played an important role in creating the kinds of opportunities that were realized in the context of the TPP agreement. \xc2\xa0But for the specifics of this particular trip, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to USDA.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, the release of the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership reveals there was no language in there addressing laws criminalizing homosexuality in Malaysia and Brunei. \xc2\xa0As I told you before, same-sex relationships are punishable with up to 20 years in prison in Malaysia, and in Brunei they recently enacted sharia law, which calls for death of gay people by stoning. \xc2\xa0Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a reasonable expectation that an agreement promoted -- quoted as \xe2\x80\x9cadvancing human rights\xe2\x80\x9d would address those laws?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Chris, for the details about what was included and what\xe2\x80\x99s not, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to USTR. \xc2\xa0Obviously it is a long document, and I will confess to not having read the thousands of pages that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not quibbling with you. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just acknowledging that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the opportunity to read the entire agreement myself. \xc2\xa0I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got several hours of flights coming up that -- (laughter) -- I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably pass the time in other ways. \xc2\xa0But USTR can certainly address that specific issue for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me just say a couple things about it, though. \xc2\xa0There are provisions, based on what I have been briefed, that do relate to raising human rights standards, and making adherence to those standards by other countries binding on the overall agreement. \xc2\xa0And that is an important part of this agreement, and one of the reasons that we believed that it was important.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to some of the specific issues that you have addressed, whenever the President travels around the world he makes clear to the leaders of other countries when he\xe2\x80\x99s visiting with them how seriously we take the issue of human rights in this country, and how the United States uses our influence around the world to try to advance the cause of universal human rights, not just for U.S. citizens, but for human beings around the globe. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will have more than one opportunity over the course of this trip to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd at this point, I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to preview too much the bilateral meeting that the President has planned with the Prime Minister of Malaysia. \xc2\xa0But I do know that in the context of his visit to Malaysia, the President will have an opportunity to visit with some civil society groups. \xc2\xa0This is something that the President has done on his travels to other locations in the world, not just spending time with the government that\xe2\x80\x99s in power, but also spending time with the leaders of civil society organizations that are trying to bring about the kind of change that they would like to see in their country and in their government.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany of these civil society organizations are organized around some of these human rights issues, including the ones that you raised. \xc2\xa0So I guess the point is there will be some discussion about these issues generally in the context of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip, and so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to stay tuned.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to the families who lost hostages (inaudible) -- ISIL. \xc2\xa0The essence of the full family statement questioned whether enough effort had been made by the United States government to rescuing their son. \xc2\xa0What is the response to that particular part of their concern?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ron, the President himself has said that significant effort and resources on the part of the United States government was invested in trying to safely recover hostages that were being held -- American hostages that were being held by ISIL. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President personally authorized a raid of U.S. special operators in the summer of 2014 inside of Syria to try to recover U.S. hostages that were being held.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnfortunately, that raid did not result in the safe rescue of Western hostages, but it does serve as a useful illustration of the extent to which the President and the rest of the U.S. government was willing to invest to try to secure the release of -- and rescue of these American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the task force that was set up, I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to understand the parameters of it. \xc2\xa0Is the issue of ransom on the agenda? \xc2\xa0Or is it more about communications, as you seem to be indicating, and relations between the government and the family?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The policies as it relates to ransoms has not changed, but the structure that has been set up inside the U.S. government is actually structured to ensure that information-sharing among the variety of government agencies that are involved in these ongoing efforts is done efficiently, and that we are leveraging the best practices and expertise of different elements of the U.S. government to try to secure the release and safe return of U.S. hostages.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo some of this is about more effective communication and the leveraging of expertise internally in our efforts to secure the release of American hostages. \xc2\xa0Some of it is also about streamlining and making more effective our communication with the families who have loved ones who are being held hostage. \xc2\xa0So it serves a variety of purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So despite the success that some European countries have had in freeing their nationals, the issue of ransom payments is not on the table, is not being discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The policy of the United States -- and this is a policy that was in place in previous administrations as well -- is that the U.S. government paying ransoms to secure the release of U.S. citizens only allows extremist organizations to get access to financing for their terrorist activities. \xc2\xa0But it also only serves to make American citizens traveling around the world even more a target of those who may be hoping to profit from hostage-taking.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think you said that we were going to hear from the President after this national security meeting. \xc2\xa0What form is that going to take?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There will be an opportunity for the pool to photograph the meeting and to hear from the President about the discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No news on Guantanamo Bay this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional guidance for you beyond just letting you know that the promise plan that we said that we\xe2\x80\x99d present to Congress is something that will come relatively soon. \xc2\xa0And when it\xe2\x80\x99s presented to Congress, it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make public -- at least as much of it as is possible, given the classification restraints that may be in place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I would think that that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen while the President is out of the country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a more specific timing update beyond just saying that we would expect that to come relatively soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but notice there are a lot of Secretaries of State, or former Secretaries of State at the meeting this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hypothetically speaking, is TPP the kind of agreement that someone who served in the position like Secretary of State should support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think each of these Secretaries of State will make their own determination about what they believe is in the best interest of the United States, our national security and our economy. \xc2\xa0And the Secretaries of State that I laid out who will be participating in this meeting -- including James Baker, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger \xc2\xa0-- all share the President\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that agreements like that aren\xe2\x80\x99t just good for our economy, they are also good for advancing the national security interest of the United States around the globe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask more directly. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Was this meant to contrast Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to TPP, bringing in all these former Secretaries?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not in any way. \xc2\xa0I think what it is intended to do is to highlight the fact that there is strong bipartisan agreement among those who have been thinking about this issue the most, that the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement isn\xe2\x80\x99t just good for our economy. \xc2\xa0We could convene a meeting of economists that have served Presidents of both parties to talk about the significant economic consequences of implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0And we could talk at length -- maybe someday we will -- about the variety of sectors in the U.S. economy that would benefit from a trade agreement like this, because of the impact that it has in raising the playing field -- leveling it off, and giving U.S. businesses and U.S. workers the opportunity to compete in one of the most economically dynamic regions of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tIronically, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually not what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today. \xc2\xa0This meeting will actually be focused on how an agreement like this gives the United States an opportunity to capitalize on the desire of countries throughout the Asia Pacific to deepen their relationship with the United States, and that has the result of binding other countries to raise their labor standards, to better abide by generally accepted environmental standards, to better abide by and raise human rights standards that are in place in their country. \xc2\xa0All of these are things that advance the national interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0And you don\xe2\x80\x99t just have to take my word for it, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t just have to take President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s word for it; there is a bipartisan group of experts that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with today who agree with that sentiment.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0While we\xe2\x80\x99re on the topic, how would you describe Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s role in getting TPP across the finish line? \xc2\xa0I know her agency did not take a lead role in negotiating it, but she certainly said positive things about the agreement while she was serving in this administration. \xc2\xa0Would you describe her role as helpful?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what I would do is, the person who would know best about her role is Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0And I know this is something that she talked about in her book and in other places where she discussed her service to the administration. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that the President was certainly quite pleased with the way that Secretary Clinton represented the United States around the world to advance out interests in a variety of areas, including in trying to deepen our relationship with countries in the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\tJoe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Putin has, among other things, said he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to work with the United States on airstrikes against ISIS. \xc2\xa0Is there any response to that here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I saw those reports shortly before I came out. \xc2\xa0Joe, what we have said about the Russian involvement thus far is that the actions that they have taken are consistent with a strategy to prop up the Assad regime and to protect the longstanding Russian investment -- military investment inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0At the same time, the Russians have acknowledged that a political transition inside of Syria will be necessary to bring an end to the violence and chaos in that country that has threatened their investment in the first place. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe problem is President Putin has failed to address a fundamental contradiction in this strategy. \xc2\xa0On the one hand, they say that we need a political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0On the other hand, they\xe2\x80\x99re expending significant military resources to try to prop up and cement the status of the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0I think that because of that internal contradiction, most people who have taken a look at this are not optimistic at all about the success that Russia is likely to have in this regard. \xc2\xa0In fact, President Obama has indicated his belief that they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to only deepen their involvement in a quagmire that will further isolate Russia and pose a more significant risk to their national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at this point, we are, I think, understandably responding to their actions on the ground, and their actions on the ground have not been consistent with the kinds of overtures that they\xe2\x80\x99ve rather conspicuously made in public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So should that be interpreted as a rejection of Putin\xe2\x80\x99s offer to work with the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it should be interpreted as our desire to see Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions inside of Syria align with their public comments. \xc2\xa0And thus far, we have not seen that. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of benefits to that in terms of resolving this contradiction, in terms of actually making progress toward the kind of political reconciliation that President Putin himself has acknowledged will be necessary to address the many problems that are plaguing Syria right now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Putin made those statements in an interview. \xc2\xa0Has any of that message been conveyed through official or backdoor channels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of the latest communications between Russian officials and U.S. officials on this topic.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And speaking of interviews, the President in an interview yesterday with ABC said that ISIS had been contained. \xc2\xa0And just the armchair point of view of the average American who sees the possibility that ISIS blew up a plane over the Sinai, or contributed to a big bombing in Beirut is signs that ISIS is not contained. \xc2\xa0What does the President mean by \xe2\x80\x9ccontained\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President was referring very specifically to the situation on the ground in Iraq and in Syria; that the significant response that was mobilized by the United States and the international community was a reaction to ISIL not just establishing a toehold and a safe haven inside of Syria, but actually spreading rapidly across the deserts of Iraq and taking over large territories there, and advancing on some of the larger population centers inside of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because of the quick action of the United States, because of the expertise of our military and our success in bolstering the capacity of Iraqi security forces, and because of our success in building a broad, international coalition, that offensive was blunted and, in fact, what we see is we see that the territory where ISIL had previously freely operated had been reduced by anywhere from 20 to 25 percent when you consider the territory that it previously operated in, in both Iraq and in Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was referring to, and we continue to be mindful of the fact that there are extremist organizations that have been in place for quite some time, including in places like the Sinai Peninsula, that may be seeking to align themselves with ISIL but particularly when it comes to the Sinai Peninsula we\xe2\x80\x99ve been aware of and vigilant about countering that extremist threat in whatever form it takes on the Sinai Peninsula for a long time now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John\xe2\x80\x9d strike, could you give us some sense of just what the role of the coalition partners was in this? \xc2\xa0Was it a large role? \xc2\xa0And was it more the U.S. going it alone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can tell you that this was a U.S. airstrike that was carried out against Mr. Emwazi. \xc2\xa0However, there was significant intelligence that had to be developed to determine his whereabouts and to develop the specific target. \xc2\xa0We have talked at length about how our intelligence capabilities are enhanced based on our strong working relationship with allies and partners in the region who are part of our coalition. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any firsthand knowledge of the intelligence that was used in this regard and even if I did, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it from here. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s at least one example of how our international counter-ISIL coalition is critical to our overall success, including the success of this one component of our broader strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last question, if it was not the President who ordered the shot on \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John,\xe2\x80\x9d who was it? \xc2\xa0Was it JSOC, was it Fort Bragg? \xc2\xa0Was it the theater commander? \xc2\xa0Who ordered the shot?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense for that. \xc2\xa0Obviously this is consistent with the guidelines that the Department of Defense has received from the Commander-in-Chief about carrying out these kinds of operations, so there is a well-established process for making a decision about the appropriate time and place for these missions to be carried out and for decisions to be made about how best to carry out these missions. \xc2\xa0But for figuring out at which level those decisions are made, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in that chain of command.</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Although it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not the purpose of the meeting, will the President\xe2\x80\x99s counter-ISIL initiative on any level -- the conversation that he will be having with the G20 allies, will that at all become a topic, even on a smaller scale, with the very distinguished former secretaries that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with later on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they all have well-informed views on it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the agenda. \xc2\xa0It certainly is possible that things that are not on the agenda could come up, but the goal of this meeting is to focus on the national security benefits for the United States of completing a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It could come up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It could. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not on the agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I know you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to telegraph too much about the meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, but can you say if the President is going to raise the corruption allegations that have been brought against the Prime Minister and if you think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to color the ASEAN or East Asia summits?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Scott, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of those reports but it is commonplace for the President to meet one on one with the host leader for the ASEAN Summit. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that obviously in previous years and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in this case as well. \xc2\xa0The President on his travels to other parts of the world -- I guess most recently in Africa, the President made a strong case about how corruption weakens governance, inhibits economic growth, and saps public confidence in government. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preview the meeting at this point, but I would note that in addition to the meeting that the President will have with Prime Minister Najib, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also have the opportunity to meet with civil society leaders in Malaysia, including advocates for good government. \xc2\xa0And, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of leaders to live up to the standards and keep the faith of the citizens that they are responsible for leading; that that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously what is expected of them but it\xe2\x80\x99s also in the interests of their continued ability to successfully run the country and to advance the interest of that country not just at home but around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask another follow-up on the Emwazi strike. \xc2\xa0What is the setback for ISIS at this point? \xc2\xa0I mean, how would you characterize his role specifically? \xc2\xa0Was this an operational role, planning, developing battle plans? \xc2\xa0Was this more of a propaganda/recruitment role? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the ultimate setback for ISIS after this strike?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jared, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ll call it a setback until a final determination has been reached about the actual operation and what the results of the operation were. \xc2\xa0I think in general I can describe him as -- I can describe Mr. Emwazi as an ISIL leader, somebody who was a strategist for the organization. \xc2\xa0He was involved in their efforts to recruit and radicalize individuals around the globe to hopefully inspire them to take up the cause of ISIL. \xc2\xa0He was somebody who demonstrated some sophistication with social media and so in that regard, he made an important contribution to the functioning of ISIL. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why he was targeted in this strike and it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s why this issue has gotten a lot of attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And with that, was there any consideration given to a capture mission instead of just an airstrike -- I mean, for intelligence purposes or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense about that. \xc2\xa0I think that would require an assessment that a capture operation like that was feasible. \xc2\xa0And given the fact that this operation took place in Raqqa, it might raise questions about whether or not something like that was feasible. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense about whether or not something like that was considered.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, other than Emwazi\xe2\x80\x99s roles as a strategist and a recruiter for ISIS, he was also the very public face of a very brutal organization. \xc2\xa0And the President said that anywhere American citizens are harmed, we will bring them -- the perpetrators -- to justice. \xc2\xa0How big of a PR or a psychological blow is this to ISIS? \xc2\xa0The fact that he was able to follow through on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, Pam, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a stickler for details here but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If he was killed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0If that is the case, obviously this is -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on what the possible conclusions of the operation may have been. \xc2\xa0The Department of Defense will speak to this and ultimately if they have a final assessment to offer, they\xe2\x80\x99ll do that. \xc2\xa0But I just -- I think it would be prudent at this point for me to not engage in that hypothetical.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This was more than a strategist, though, this was a very public identifying person with ISIS.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I would allow that this is an individual that of all of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s leading figures may be the one that is tragically the most familiar to Americans. \xc2\xa0But, again, the reason that he was targeted in this strike is because of his role as a leader and strategist for ISIL, specifically as it relates to his efforts to recruit and radicalize individuals to join the ISIL cause.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t targeted for killing Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Pam, we\'ve been quite clear that these kinds of operations are not motivated by a desire to seek revenge or retribution, but rather to advance the national security interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why this specific targeting was for the reasons that I\'ve outlined.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\'m sorry if I missed something, but is this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve publicly confirmed that Jihadi John was Mohammed Emwazi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s a good question. \xc2\xa0I\'ll have to go and check on whether or not that\'s something that we\'ve previously done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I know you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to because the intelligence community felt that it was not helpful.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It may, in fact, be, but let me confirm that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t**[This was the first official USG confirmation that Mohammed Emwazi was \xe2\x80\x9cJihadi John.\xe2\x80\x9d]</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Also, on the TPP, you said that it was going to have an impact on raising the playing field in a variety of areas. \xc2\xa0One of the big concerns that some of the opposition groups like the AFL-CIO have is that it\'s going to force American workers to compete with workers in low-wage countries like Vietnam. \xc2\xa0And the TPP does have a provision saying you have to pass minimum wage legislation, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say you have to set any particular kind of a minimum wage. \xc2\xa0So couldn\'t they just set a minimum wage of 10 cents an hour and still be in compliance with the TPP?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think for what exactly the agreement would require of a nation like Vietnam I\'d refer you to USTR, and they can sort of help you understand the commitment that Vietnam has made -- at least the details of it. \xc2\xa0But I think the point of all this, Pam, is actually that U.S. workers are already competing with workers in Vietnam. \xc2\xa0And right now they\xe2\x80\x99re doing so on a very unlevel playing field; that a country like Vietnam does not adhere to the kind of environmental standards, human rights standards and labor standards that we do in this country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think this is the basic, fundamental question before everyone who will eventually have to render a judgment on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is if you are concerned about U.S. workers being at a disadvantage when competing in some of the most economically dynamic regions of the world, the question simply is, what are you going to do about it? \xc2\xa0And there are some who complain about this quite loudly but have not articulated any kind of strategy that is consistent with the best interest of middle-class workers, U.S. businesses, or our broader economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, on the other hand, is actually implementing a strategy to raise environmental standards, to raise labor standards, to raise human rights standards in countries like Vietnam to try to level the playing field between Vietnamese workers and American workers. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s taking the additional step of insisting that Vietnam eliminate tariffs on goods that are produced in the United States and have a market for those U.S. goods inside of Vietnam. \xc2\xa0We know that Vietnam has a thriving economy, which means that there are more people in Vietnam with more money in their pockets who would love to have the opportunity to purchase American goods. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s the essence of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. \xc2\xa0It certainly is not going to solve all of our economic problems, but when you sort of confront the basic problem that many people bemoan, the question really is, what are you going to do about it? \xc2\xa0And the President has laid out a very clear strategy for how we can improve our economic prospects for middle-class families in the United States while at the same time advancing the interests of the United States when it comes to our position around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to China, we know that China would love to keep those standards low. \xc2\xa0We know that that would create ample opportunity for Chinese businesses that also don\'t adhere to labor standards and civil rights standards and human rights standards and environmental standards -- that by lowering those standards or keeping them low, China benefits. \xc2\xa0But by raising those standards and opening up markets around the world to American goods, you\'re going to create significant economic opportunity right here in the United States for middle-class workers. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the essence of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. \xc2\xa0And it\'s the essence of the question that will be before Democrats and Republicans in the Congress when they\xe2\x80\x99re asked to vote to approve the agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tConnie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0On the Israeli aid package, is there anything new to report? \xc2\xa0Do you expect it to be settled in this administration? \xc2\xa0And about U.S. troops in Sinai, is there anything being said about pulling back some of the U.S. troops from the Sinai?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As it relates to the Sinai, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates in terms of our security posture there, but you can check with the Department of Defense about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next step in the effort to sign a new memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel when it comes to military assistance is for a U.S. team of working-level experts to travel to Israel and engage their counterparts in a discussion about the assessment of the security situation in the region and an assessment of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to meet those threats.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that is a trip that will occur in December. \xc2\xa0I would not expect an agreement to be reached before then. \xc2\xa0This obviously is the next step in the process of trying to reach that agreement. \xc2\xa0But as the President announced in Israel back in 2013, our intent is to sign that memorandum of understanding between the United States and Israel before the President leaves office, and certainly well in advance of the expiration of the current memorandum of understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn Gizzi, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two days ago, Prime Minister Cerar of Slovenia ordered the construction of an electric fence, ostensibly to keep refugees out. \xc2\xa0And this has been likened to the same course taken by Mr. Orb\xc3\xa1n in Hungary. \xc2\xa0The President, of course, is committed to helping in the refugee crisis, as is Secretary Kerry. \xc2\xa0What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reaction when EU members take a course such as that taken by Slovenia in this crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as a general matter, John, that the United States continues to be quite concerned about the significant humanitarian crisis that is emanating from Syria. \xc2\xa0Millions of Syrians have been displaced from their homes inside of Syria, and millions more have been forced to flee Syria to escape violence. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve read some tragic reports of Syrians being killed on that journey, and it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic. \xc2\xa0And the President is quite concerned about the destabilizing impact that this is having on the region. \xc2\xa0Countries like Lebanon and Jordan and Turkey are bearing a significant burden of trying to meet the basic humanitarian needs of these individuals who are fleeing violence in their home country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States has made a commitment to provide extensive humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0The United States, in fact, is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to this effort -- and we may have even a little bit more news on that for you later today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would expect that at the G20 meeting that there will be an opportunity for the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economies to talk about what more can be done to try to meet the needs of Syrians who are fleeing violence in their country and imposing a significant burden even on the country that world leaders are visiting over the weekend, in Turkey. \xc2\xa0So I would expect that this will be the subject of extensive discussion. \xc2\xa0And the United States has obviously done a lot already, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be more interested in having conversations with other leading global economies about what more they can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So Slovenia and Hungary, are they meeting the same standards, or not meeting the same standards, as the countries you mentioned?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, I think I would stick to sort of where we have been on this, which I think that the vast majority of Europeans have responded to this situation in a way that is consistent with the kinds of values that we hold dear here in the United States, which is recognizing the humanity in these individuals and trying to provide for their basic needs. \xc2\xa0And I do think that despite some of the news reports, I do think that\xe2\x80\x99s the prevailing sentiment inside of Europe. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think there\xe2\x80\x99s also a realistic conclusion that\xe2\x80\x99s drawn about how significant this problem is, and that the resources that Europe can devote to addressing this problem are necessarily limited, given the other challenges facing the countries on the continent.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a difficult problem, and one that merits the attention of the international community. \xc2\xa0It certainly is one that has the attention of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Final question. \xc2\xa0Louisiana is having a race for governor next week. \xc2\xa0All polls show the Democrat, John Bel Edwards with a healthy lead over Senator Vitter -- \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Seems to have been a rather colorful race, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It certainly is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0In the fine tradition of Louisiana politics. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0This one is certainly living up to that state\xe2\x80\x99s colorful reputation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. Edwards has made joining the Medicaid exchange a premier point of his campaign agenda. \xc2\xa0Does the President endorse him in that race? \xc2\xa0I know he\xe2\x80\x99ll be away, but does he support the Democratic nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has taken a position in this race. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how closely he has followed it -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s not following it closely, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably missing out on some entertainment value. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But I suspect that he\xe2\x80\x99s been kept abreast of it. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any official position that the administration has taken on the race. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the voters of Louisiana will have to determine who should lead them next.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right, everybody, have a good weekend. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you when we get back from our long trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:55 P.M.
