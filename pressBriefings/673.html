EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So this is the only paper statement, only statement from the President on the Supreme Court decision on DOMA.\xc2\xa0 So I\'m just here to provide you that statement and also to tell you -- which has been released at home -- that the President made two phone calls from Air Force One after the ruling, after we were made aware of the rulings.</p>\n<p>The first was to Edie Windsor.\xc2\xa0 Edie is the plaintiff in United States v. Windsor in the Defense of Marriage Act.\xc2\xa0 And the President congratulated her on this victory, which was a long time in the making, said he was heartened by the Court\'s decision to strike down Section 3 of DOMA so that loving, committed couples could enjoy full equality under the law.\xc2\xa0 And, he said, that it is fitting that this historic ruling should come today, just 10 years after the Court struck down laws making same-sex relationships illegal in Lawrence v. Texas.</p>\n<p>Separately, he called Chad Griffin, President of the Human Rights Campaign, and the plaintiffs and legal team involved with the Proposition 8 case -- it was one call on speaker phone -- and congratulated them on a tremendous victory today.\xc2\xa0 He noted that although the Court did not address the constitutionality of Proposition 8, today\'s ruling is a victory for Kris, Sandy, Paul and Jeff -- these are plaintiffs in Prop 8 -- and to all loving, committed couples in the state of California.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is paraphrasing the President, but the President noted that the laws of our land are catching up to the fundamental truth that millions of Americans have come to accept -- we are all more free when all Americans are treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love.\xc2\xa0 So he made those two calls.\xc2\xa0 You had asked how he was made aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if it was the case back here, but we lost connectivity right at the critical moment.\xc2\xa0 We also lost Internet connectivity briefly.\xc2\xa0 But we were able to learn via telephone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who called him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Kathy Ruemmler, White House Counsel.\xc2\xa0 Before they spoke, we had gotten a call from White House staff in the office just first with the DOMA ruling, and then with the decision not to address the constitutionality of Prop 8.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he fist pump into the air or was there any sort of reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He was obviously pleased.\xc2\xa0 He believes that this is a very good day for civil rights in our country and was just glad to see the decisions come down as they did.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:05 P.M.
