Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:49 A.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, at the top of today\xe2\x80\x99s briefing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, with me to talk a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming trip to China, Burma and Australia next week.\xc2\xa0 So she will have some opening remarks and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions, at least for a little bit before she has to go and get ready for this congressional meeting this afternoon.</p>\n<p>I know that there is a lot of attention around some news reports indicating that the President is prepared to announce his nominee to be the next Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 The President has not made a decision on that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have any personnel announcements on that matter at all today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, Susan, you want to get started?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go through the top lines of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a few of your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President remains deeply committed to his Asia rebalancing strategy, and its implementation will remain a top priority throughout this second term.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to his upcoming trip to China, Burma and Australia.\xc2\xa0 As you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, it\xe2\x80\x99s his second trip to Asia this year.\xc2\xa0 And as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say before, America\xe2\x80\x99s security and our prosperity are increasingly and inextricably linked to the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 The United States is and will remain an Asian Pacific power, and we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in fostering an open and transparent security and economic order amid what is an increasing and already high demand from the region for U.S. leadership.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur trade and investment ties to Asia are critical to our future economic growth and to generating American jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. economy is expanding because of actions that President Obama has taken, including through our engagement with the Asian Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 His leadership and global fora, like the G20, has resulted in a more stable and resilient global financial system and collective agreement among the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economies to take meaningful actions to promote growth and quality jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will arrive in Beijing on Monday, the 10th, for a three-day visit.\xc2\xa0 The first portion of the visit will be focused around his participation in the APEC Leaders Meeting and the APEC CEO Summit, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver remarks on our relationship in the region and the importance we attach to APEC as an institution and our collaborative commercial and economic ties.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also participate in a TPP Leaders Meeting in Beijing, and also have bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Abbott of Australia and President Widodo of Indonesia.\xc2\xa0 Our participation at APEC will highlight several themes.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with our Asian partners to deepen our trade and investment ties through progress on agreements, such as the WTO Information Technology Agreement and the Environmental Goods and Services Agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re working to bring China into the rules-based institutional structures in Asia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will participate subsequently in a full bilateral program with Xi Jinping of China over the final day and a half of our visit there.\xc2\xa0 This is an official state visit and it will include some of the formal elements that you are accustomed to seeing in any such state visit, but there will also be several opportunities for more informal and extended conversations between the two leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPresident Obama appreciates the opportunity to have candid and in-depth conversations with President Xi about our respective priorities, given the breadth and the importance of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.\xc2\xa0 This visit is an opportunity to identify a forward-looking agenda for the next two years of this relationship.\xc2\xa0 And we seek to build a relationship with China that advances American economic and security interests, that solves global problems, and is true to American values and interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe next stop will be in Burma, and in Naypyidaw the President will participate in the East Asia Summit and then in the U.S.-ASEAN Summit.\xc2\xa0 President\xe2\x80\x99s Obama participation in these meetings will highlight U.S. leadership in addressing maritime territorial disputes, encouraging regional leadership on challenges such as the counter-ISIL campaign and the Ebola epidemic, as well as on upholding international law and norms.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe will have a bilateral program as well in Burma, and the President will have meetings with President Thein Sein in Naypyidaw, and Aung San Suu Kyi in Rangoon.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also have the opportunity while in Burma to meet with the Vietnamese Prime Minister.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur primary message will be that the United States recognizes the progress that Burma has made, but notes that real challenges remain and missteps have been made in the course of this transition.\xc2\xa0 We will stress that our engagement is helping to keep reforms on track, and we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to continue the support -- we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to continue to support the government as it confronts its remaining challenges.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in Burma, we will underscore the United States commitment to the protection of human rights, tolerance and pluralism, as well as sustaining and deepening the democratic transition.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs I mentioned, in Rangoon, in addition to meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, the President will participate in a cultural event.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with civil society leaders.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in another meeting of the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in a town hall format, as he did in Malaysia in the spring.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur final stop on the trip will be in Australia, where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Brisbane.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, Australia is an unflinching friend and ally of the United States with whom we share a relationship based on shared values, outlook and shared sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 The President will have already met with President Abbott in China; that is a function of the fact that the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is quite constrained given that he is hosting the G20 Summit.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDuring the G20 Leaders Meeting in Brisbane, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to highlight how President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s economic leadership has resulted in a significant increase in the resilience and the stability of the global financial system and how the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest economies continue to take meaningful action to promise growth and quality jobs -- through investment in infrastructure; through labor force participation, particularly that of women; financial inclusion in energy, which will all be key themes of the G20.</p>\n<p>Also, in Brisbane, the President will deliver a major policy address and discuss U.S. leadership in Asia, especially on economic issues.\xc2\xa0 And the speech will also provide an opportunity to reaffirm America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the Asia Pacific rebalance, and do so irrespective of the other global challenges that are obviously on our plate.\xc2\xa0 The speech will outline our Asia policy priorities for the remainder of the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term.</p>\n<p>Thank you, and I look forward to taking some questions.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have time for about four or five questions here.\xc2\xa0 Ed, do you want to start us off?</p>\n<p>Q Ambassador Rice, thank you.\xc2\xa0 In some of the preview pieces for this trip, in the region there is skepticism about the pivot, there\xe2\x80\x99s concerns that the President, rightly so, has been focused on other crises -- ISIS, Ebola, et cetera.\xc2\xa0 And with the change in the election and the new balance of power, there\xe2\x80\x99s concerns maybe you can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver on the money to help with some of the military portions of the pivot.\xc2\xa0 What can you, what can the President do on this trip to prove the skeptics wrong?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think if you actually are engaged in the dialogues that I am with our partners in the region, you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear them say, as I heard from the ASEAN ambassadors with whom I met this week, that they recognize that the United States is making an unprecedented commitment to the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 They note that in a year, with all the issues that we are all facing, the President is now taking his second trip to Asia, which, as you know, is a substantial investment of time and attention.\xc2\xa0 And the preparation that we all put into making such visits a success in terms of substance I think underscores the strong commitment that we have and will maintain to the Asia Pacific region.</p>\n<p>So what we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing -- on our first trip back in the spring, it was a trip that focused largely on our bilateral relationships with key allies and partners.\xc2\xa0 I think they were highly successful visits that served to underscore our commitment to our core friendships and alliances in the region.</p>\n<p>This trip will deal with the complex and very important bilateral relationship with China as well as multilateral institutions that are playing a critical role in Asia in which we play a very prominent leadership role.</p>\n<p>So I think quite the opposite.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that we are engaged in a very energetic and constructive way in the Asia Pacific region, and are there talking about some of the global challenges that we all share -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s countering the threat that ISIL poses, or dealing with global health security issues and the Ebola epidemic -- it just shows how integral the Asia Pacific region is not only to our prosperity but to our national security as well as global security.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>Q I wanted to ask you about something a little different -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence with the Ayatollah Khomeini.\xc2\xa0 What does he hope to accomplish with this correspondence?\xc2\xa0 And do you see coordination and cooperation with Iran on this campaign against ISIS?\xc2\xa0 And then one other thing, which is, now that the elections are over, do you expect that you will see changes in the national security team?\xc2\xa0 And what are your plans? Are you going to be here until the end?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Let me answer the second question first.\xc2\xa0 I serve at the pleasure of the President, and I will continue to serve as long as he\xe2\x80\x99d like me to.</p>\n<p>With respect to potential presidential correspondence, I think you know that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on any private communication between the President and any world leader.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this:\xc2\xa0 First of all, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly in public, and others have too, we are in no way engaged in any coordination -- military coordination with Iran on countering ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that ISIL poses a threat not only to the people of Iraq and Syria, but to the broader region and to the United States and to Europe.\xc2\xa0 And we are dealing with that threat, but we are not doing so in coordination with the government of Iran.</p>\n<p>Secondly, there\xe2\x80\x99s no linkage between our efforts to resolve the nuclear issue through the P5-plus-1 negotiations and our counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 And we have never made that linkage.\xc2\xa0 So the reports that suggest the contrary are inaccurate.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Darlene.</p>\n<p>Q I wanted to go back to Burma and the optics of the President visiting there at a time when the government there has given this ultimatum to the Rohingya people to either prove they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived there for however many years or leave.\xc2\xa0 Are there any concerns about the President visiting while this is going on, and meeting with leaders of the government there who are overseeing this?\xc2\xa0 And what would his message be to them when he sits down with the leader?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, we are going back to Burma for the second time for the purpose of attending the East Asia Summit, as well as the U.S.-ASEAN Summit.\xc2\xa0 But we do look forward to the opportunity to continue our engagement with the leaders and the people of Burma.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have real concerns, and we have expressed them repeatedly about circumstances in Rakhine state, and the transition to democracy, which is a challenging one.\xc2\xa0 And we will raise those concerns very directly.\xc2\xa0 And we will have the opportunity to do so not only with the Burmese President, but with Aung San Suu Kyi and with civil society leaders and, indeed, the young people of the ASEAN Leadership Forum.</p>\n<p>So these are issues that are high on the agenda in terms of our bilateral relationship with Burma.\xc2\xa0 And as we do in every circumstance, whether these are complex or fraught issues, they will be raised.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Major.</p>\n<p>Q To what degree will the President raise cybersecurity and the ADIZ with the Chinese leadership?\xc2\xa0 And what are his goals on those issues?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective on Australia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the Ebola crisis?\xc2\xa0 And what business will you try to do with Putin at the G20?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with China.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And you may have to remind me of all your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>With respect to China, clearly the issues of cybersecurity will be prominent on our bilateral agenda.\xc2\xa0 This is a source of grave concern to the United States.\xc2\xa0 We have reiterated on every occasion the fact that we oppose any efforts -- official or unofficial -- to engage in cyber-espionage for commercial gain or other purposes.\xc2\xa0 And this has been and will remain a topic of discussion.\xc2\xa0 So no question about that.</p>\n<p>With respect to Australia, we have had frequent communications with the Australians and other key allies and partners about the necessity of mobilizing a very effective global response to the Ebola epidemic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Australia has just recently announced an additional financial contribution to its efforts to counter the Ebola epidemic.\xc2\xa0 And we look to Australia and other partners that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to meet with at the G20 to do -- to fulfill the commitments they\xe2\x80\x99ve made and do more, quite frankly. Because at this stage, there are many needs that remain unmet in the West African region -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s financial resources, particularly for the U.N. appeal, health care workers, beds, medical supplies.\xc2\xa0 All of those remain key requirements, and the United States has played a very active and prominent leadership role, not only through our own national contributions, but in galvanizing the rest of the international community.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to look to capable partners like Australia to do their part.</p>\n<p>Q Does the travel ban complicate that?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Australians explain their own travel ban.\xc2\xa0 Our view is that it is, in fact, a counter-productive step to impose a travel ban for two primary reasons.\xc2\xa0 One, we need most importantly to be able to flow the personnel and assets into the region to counter the epidemic there, and that would be impeded by a travel ban.\xc2\xa0 And we also, frankly, think that, to the extent that we and others take efforts to preclude travel, what we may do inadvertently is to make it more likely that folks will try to enter our country or others without being properly screened and without going through the kind of scrutiny that we think is working quite well now.</p>\n<p>You asked about Putin, and he will obviously be present at the G20.\xc2\xa0 I imagine, as in the past, that there will be an opportunity for the G20 leaders to engage informally on the margins.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no formal bilateral meetings scheduled or planned, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at all surprised if they had some informal communication.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Kristen.</p>\n<p>QJosh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 And, Ambassador Rice, thank you.\xc2\xa0 How strong will President Obama be when he meets with President Xi on the issue of the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong?\xc2\xa0 And then, on the issue of the TPP, what are the remaining sticking points?\xc2\xa0 I know that there had been an effort to try to get that resolved before the trip.\xc2\xa0 How close is it to being resolved?\xc2\xa0 And is the fact that Republicans now control the Congress, does that actually help get this through more quickly?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, with respect to TPP, obviously this is a top priority for the United States.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement that, if achieved and ratified, will benefit the American people and the American economy in very meaningful ways.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an integral part of our Asia Pacific rebalance strategy.</p>\n<p>We continue to be making progress with our partners engaged in the TPP negotiations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect, however, that there will be any final announcements or agreements achieved during the course of this trip.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Froman is over there already in Beijing working on this and a range of other issues, and will continue to do so because we think such an agreement would be beneficial for the United States economy and for creating jobs here.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we look forward to consulting very closely with Congress, and obviously both parties in Congress on the importance of this agreement, and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>QAnd on the issue of the pro-democracy protestors, what is his message going to be on that specifically?\xc2\xa0 How firm will he --</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about our views and concerns about Hong Kong and other aspects of human rights and civil liberties in China, as we have been elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And I fully expect that issues of human rights will be on the agenda.</p>\n<p>One last one maybe.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Josh, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QHi, Ambassador Rice, can you talk about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule in China?\xc2\xa0 Is he doing any type of civil society or people-to-people or cultural event?\xc2\xa0 And if not, why not?\xc2\xa0 Would you like to see him doing that during his stay there?</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Well, this trip, unlike his previous trip to China, is obviously framed around the APEC Summit.\xc2\xa0 And then we have, on the other end, the East Asia Summit and the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, so we have a relatively constrained timeframe.\xc2\xa0 So we won\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity to do more, frankly, than what we would do in and around the APEC Summit and in and around the bilateral official state visit.\xc2\xa0 And even the state visit is constrained; it\xe2\x80\x99s not as long as it would normally be.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t have, for example, a state dinner, given -- it will have a luncheon instead.\xc2\xa0 But the schedule has been relatively compressed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, Susan, I know you have a lunch that you\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to this afternoon.</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Yes, indeed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get to that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>AMBASSADOR RICE:\xc2\xa0 Good to see you all.\xc2\xa0 See you on the trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Darlene, you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>QThank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I understand why you said at the top that the White House wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t comment on these reports out there about Loretta Lynch possibly being a choice for AG.\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, for example, why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the White House want to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Darlene, the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re not commenting on this because we typically do not make personnel comments in advance of the President, who made a decision.\xc2\xa0 And in this instance, the President has not made a decision about who he will nominate to be the next Attorney General.</p>\n<p>QOkay.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more details on the lunch?\xc2\xa0 Yesterday there was some details that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have; I think one of those was the menu.\xc2\xa0 Did you come with that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not come prepared to talk about the menu.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details before the day is out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QSour grapes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 We can definitely keep the jokes going on that one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that I would contribute to that effort, but just that -- I can give you a little better sense about what will be on the agenda at the meeting, however, if that would be useful to you.</p>\n<p>There will be an active discussion of the additional Ebola resources -- or additional resources that the administration is seeking to fight Ebola in West Africa and to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to deal with Ebola here in this country.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a discussion of that.</p>\n<p>The second thing that\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda is, as I mentioned yesterday and as the President alluded to in his news conference on Wednesday, General Austin, who is the commander of CENTCOM, will give the congressional leaders a briefing on our counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 It will be an opportunity for him to give them an update.\xc2\xa0 We have been in regular touch with congressional leaders and with the leaders of relevant committees on this issue, but this will be an opportunity for them to hear from General Austin in person, directly.\xc2\xa0 So that should be a useful component of the meeting.</p>\n<p>The third thing on the agenda is the President will look forward to the opportunity to talk about some of the areas that he\xe2\x80\x99s identified for Democrats and Republicans to find some common ground on issues.\xc2\xa0 This includes everything from investing in our infrastructure in a way that creates jobs in the short term and is good for the economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll also discuss investments in quality early childhood education; this is something that the President talked about in his State of the Union address not this past year but the year before, I believe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are the kinds of investments that are viewed by many academics to be an exceedingly efficient way to prepare the next generation of Americans to succeed; that there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong correlation between participation in early -- quality early childhood education programs and things like higher graduation rates, higher literacy rates, and also things like lower teen pregnancy rates and lower incarceration rates.</p>\n<p>So that is an area where the President is hopeful that Democrats and Republicans in years ahead will be able to find some common ground.</p>\n<p>And then they\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly talk about this issue of expanding American exports and opening up markets for American goods and services overseas.\xc2\xa0 This is something the President will be focused on quite a bit during his trip to Asia, as you heard the National Security Advisor just discuss.\xc2\xa0 But this will be something that the President will discuss in the lunch because this is something that we know is of interest to a bipartisan group of members in Congress, including some who will be participating in the lunch.</p>\n<p>And then the last thing -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth thing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also an important part of this lunch -- the President is very interested in hearing from the leaders about their agenda and the priorities that they have identified, both for the next two months but also for the next two years.\xc2\xa0 And the President is eager to give them the opportunity to make clear exactly what their agenda is and what their priorities are, and give them the opportunity to try to identify areas where they see some common ground between the priorities that the President has identified and the priorities that they have.</p>\n<p>So as you can tell, this is not something they expect that will be wrapped up in just an hour like you would a typical lunch, but this is something I think will last a couple of hours.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to try to give you a readout that includes some details about the menu, but also some insight into the discussion beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just said.</p>\n<p>QIs that a written readout, Josh?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I would anticipate, yes.\xc2\xa0 Julia.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you in the White House Briefing Room.</p>\n<p>QHi, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Will Obama be responding to the comments that Boehner made yesterday on immigration that he\xe2\x80\x99d be poisoning the well?\xc2\xa0 And will that in any way urge the President to maybe budge a little bit on his timeline for executive action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julia, the President did get this question I think on a couple of occasions at the news conference that he did on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 The President was pretty clear about his position on this, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to change.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that the President has the opportunity within the confines of the law to take some actions that we know would be good for the economy, good for the deficit, good for border security, and good for the millions of immigrants who are currently living in the shadows in this country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to address some of these challenges that are caused by a broken immigration system that people on both sides of the aisle acknowledge is broken.</p>\n<p>And it should be a -- it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I guess I should say -- it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise that this is something that the President is very focused on.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been talking about this for some time.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s provided ample opportunity for House Republicans to allow the compromise piece of legislation that was passed through the Senate to come to the floor of the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The legislation that passed through the Senate was supported by 14 Republicans.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 The President himself has acknowledged he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get everything that he wanted in that piece of legislation, but it does reflect the general principles that the President has laid out, and it does reflect the kind of bipartisan common ground that has been the subject of so much discussion in the last 72 hours or so.</p>\n<p>So there is an opportunity for Speaker Boehner and his Republican colleagues to prevent the President from taking executive action.\xc2\xa0 What they can do is they can bring up that bipartisan Senate bill to the floor for a vote, and the President would happily use his pen to sign that piece of legislation, instead of the executive actions that Secretary Johnson and others have been so hard at work on over the last several months.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QBut that would have to, of course, come probably within the lame duck.\xc2\xa0 In other words, Obama isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking any hope and possibly moving off this timeline?\xc2\xa0 I know there were reports there were even discussions this summer between Boehner and Obama that broke down over immigration.\xc2\xa0 And now the Republicans have taken back Congress, there\xe2\x80\x99s some talks about what they would do if Obama expanded work permits, or how much they would work to block anything that he passes.\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk on those lines of moving back the timeline, past the holidays?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I saw -- the short answer to your question is no.\xc2\xa0 I saw that Speaker Boehner himself was asked in the news conference that he did yesterday about whether or not he would make a specific commitment to bringing up immigration reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 And he declined to do so.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0That has been his posture for well over a year now, and it has been a posture that he\xe2\x80\x99s adopted in spite of the fact that there is bipartisan legislation that\'s already passed the Senate that shares strong bipartisan support across the country.\xc2\xa0 The business community, the evangelical community, the labor community and others have strongly supported that compromise piece of legislation that passed through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 So it does seem to me that the only people who are opposed to this compromise piece of legislation are certain segments of the House Republican conference.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a coincidence that those same members are encouraging the President -- or at least warning the President, I think in some instances, to not take executive action on immigration reform.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0It seems to me that it\xe2\x80\x99s less rooted in some sort of philosophical objection to executive action and more rooted in their opposition to common-sense immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 So the President has the opportunity before him to do something really good for the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0And I do think the message that the President and other Democrats and even some Republicans heard resoundingly from the voters is that they want their elected representatives in Washington, D.C. to not get bogged down in politics and to actually focus on the kinds of steps that they can take that will be good for the country and good for middle-class families in this country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0And the executive action that the President is considering on immigration reform falls very cleanly in that category.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Michelle.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd we heard you just say that there is no decision on the Attorney General, but we\'re still hearing rumblings that an announcement is imminent.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about whether this is close?\xc2\xa0 Are we relatively assured that this is going to happen, the confirmation during the lame duck session?\xc2\xa0 And we\'re also hearing from some in Congress that, hey, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t given a heads up on this, this possible pick, even as a finalist.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent is that going to be discussed during the lunch today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the President intends to bring it up during the lunch today, but it could come up.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out coming up.\xc2\xa0 The reason that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been extensive discussion with Capitol Hill about the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to be the next Attorney General is that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision about who the next nominee to be the Attorney General will be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0That said, whoever it is, it will be somebody that the President is confident deserves careful consideration and swift confirmation in bipartisan fashion by the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 And whether that occurs in the lame duck or in the early part of next year, both of those are certainly viable option because the President intends to nominate somebody who can be carefully considered and swiftly confirmed.</p>\n<p>QAt this point, can we say that the decision is coming very soon?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on timing.</p>\n<p>QOkay.\xc2\xa0 And also on the AUMF, we heard McCain say yesterday that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the President have broad leeway in this.\xc2\xa0 What do you think about that?\xc2\xa0 And to what extent has the administration already kind of hashed out a framework for what the AUMF will include?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, and that will be part of the discussion I think that will take place during the lunch.\xc2\xa0 The principal part of the lunch that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on the counter-ISIL campaign will be focused on getting an update from General Austin.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if that does include a discussion about the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest in engaging Congress around a right-sized and updated authorization to use military force.</p>\n<p>The way that we have described this -- I mean -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come as a surprise to you that the administration and some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- some members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team here at the White House have some ideas about how this authorization to use military force could be right-sized and updated, as the President described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That said, we\xe2\x80\x99re keenly interested in the view of Congress. After all, this is an opportunity for Congress to do something that is their responsibility and is very important, which is to demonstrate some unanimity of opinion, or at least some unity of opinion, with the President of the United States as we move forward with this counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 It will send a very clear signal to our allies around the globe that Congress and the White House are united in this effort.\xc2\xa0 It will send a similarly clear message to the American people.\xc2\xa0 It will also send a clear message to our allies that this is business that the United States and Democrats and Republicans agree is an important national security priority, and it will send a signal of the kind of commitment that the President has indicated is necessary to follow this campaign through successfully and to completion.</p>\n<p>QSo is that something you expect to see bipartisan agreement on?\xc2\xa0 And talk a little bit about the funding, too; I mean, there are reports out there of giving exact numbers on what the request will be.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that there is some common ground to be found on authorization -- on a new, right-sized, updated authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 Again, the administration continues to believe that Congress has already given the President the authority that he needs to carry out the campaign that is currently underway.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, however, that it should be updated to reflect the realities of the fight that is currently underway.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>I would anticipate that we should be able to find some common ground on this.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a variety of views on Capitol Hill about the wisdom of Congress passing a new authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a pretty robust discussion underway about what should be included in that authorization to use military force.</p>\n<p>So this is the subject of some discussion.\xc2\xa0 The President indicated in a news conference yesterday that -- or on Wednesday that it certainly is likely that this discussion would extend beyond the lame duck because of the variety of views associated with it.</p>\n<p>But again, when there are critically important pieces of legislation that need to be passed and signed into law, by definition they have to be bipartisan, be passed by Republicans and signed into law by a Democratic President.\xc2\xa0 And this is an area where I would anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find some common ground between Democrats and Republicans.</p>\n<p>Peter.\xc2\xa0 I recognize since you and I last spoke that you made an important personnel announcement of your own.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QYes, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lame duck.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But let me extend my congratulations to you and your family on your tremendous record of service here at the White House and with CBS.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QThank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\xe2\x80\x99ll miss us, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QSome aspects.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QGood luck with Attorney General.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>QAs the guy who handles the President\xe2\x80\x99s media relations, what do you make of what the Chinese state-controlled media is saying about the President and his visit today, that U.S. public opinion is reflected in the vote, has downgraded him, and that the outcome of the election will, according to the Chinese state-owned newspaper, thwart him?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, that is not an analysis that I would agree with.\xc2\xa0 I also don\xe2\x80\x99t think, frankly, looking at the comments of people like even Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think those are comments that they would agree with either.\xc2\xa0 Leader McConnell in his news conference on Wednesday indicated that the President was the only Democrat that mattered in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I agree with that assessment quite as wholeheartedly as he did, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indication that at least the incoming leader of the United States Senate considers the President to wield a lot of authority in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>So it sounds to me that maybe the Chinese didn\xe2\x80\x99t consult with Senator McConnell before those reports were published.\xc2\xa0 But what I would anticipate is that the President of the United States is somebody who continues to have pretty aggressive ambitions when it comes to American leadership around the globe.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that the President is invested in strengthening the relationship between the United States and China.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of areas where the United States and China can cooperate to the mutual benefit of the citizens of both countries.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly hope, and even anticipate, that in the context of this visit that Chinese leaders will bring a similar amount of creativity and energy to these discussions.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly thinks that the stakes related to these discussions are high, and that the opportunity is great for us to make progress both for the American people, and for Chinese leaders to make progress for the Chinese people.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is very much looking forward to the trip.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, all of that would have been true regardless of the outcome of the most recent elections.</p>\n<p>QThis obviously reflects the official view of the Chinese government.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President going to do to try to dissuade them of this, or to respond to it?\xc2\xa0 Or is he?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a specific response.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President will enter these meetings with a lot of ambition, a lot of energy and creativity to further strengthen and energize the relationship between the United States and China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We hope and even anticipate that Chinese leaders will bring that same energy and creativity to the discussions.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly believes that these discussions are critically important to the American people and to our country\xe2\x80\x99s national security.\xc2\xa0 And it would be a missed opportunity if Chinese leaders didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet him with that same spirit.</p>\n<p>QSo their assertion that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be thwarted in some way on this trip because of this, what do you say?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any evidence to indicate that that\xe2\x80\x99s a danger.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>QJosh, back to this question of the executive order -- I know you guys have said for a long time you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it before the end of the year; you signaled that before the election and all of that.\xc2\xa0 But now that the election has happened, Democrats got trounced pretty much across the board, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the Republican leadership now saying in various ways it\xe2\x80\x99s poisoning the well, it\xe2\x80\x99s playing with matches, it\xe2\x80\x99s waving a red flag in front of a bill -- a bull, it\xe2\x80\x99s pouring kerosene on a fire.\xc2\xa0 I mean, given that we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing the Republican leadership coming in and practically pleading with the President not to do this, why not listen to them and put it off for a little while, and at least talk to them about it first?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, the President has had countless discussions with Republican leaders and with the American people about the importance of moving forward on comprehensive immigration reform; that there are significant economic and national security benefits associated with putting in place reforms to a system that everybody acknowledges is broken.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been ample opportunity for Republicans to work with Democrats to correct some of those problems in a way that has significant benefits for our economy, that would further reduce the deficit, and that would further strengthen our security at the border.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Senate Republicans took up that challenge, to their credit, worked with Senate Democrats, passed a piece of legislation through the Senate that represented a common-sense offering of reforms.\xc2\xa0 And Speaker Boehner, despite strong bipartisan support in Washington, D.C. and across the country for that piece of legislation, and in the House of which he is the leader, has declined to bring that bill up for a vote.</p>\n<p>And again, Jon, the simple question before the White House and before the President himself is, is the President going to use the authority that he has under the law and under the Constitution to take some steps that would be good for the American people?\xc2\xa0 And the simple answer to that question is, yes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do it before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Let me just say one other thing about that.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that the President doing something that Republicans disagree with, that that should squander an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground.\xc2\xa0 I can sit up here -- I can stand up here and say, Republicans to vote once again, for the 50th time, to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that that\xe2\x80\x99s playing with fire, or waving a red flag in front of a bull, or -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not really even sure what that means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QIt was the bull --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 I guess anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been to a bull fight probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the bull in that analogy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But I think the point is, the message that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from voters across the country over the last several elections, but in this election as well, is that Democrats and Republicans need to find a way to identify common ground and make progress for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that anybody has to fold on their principles, but it does mean we should not allow our differences of opinion on some issues to affect our ability to find common ground on areas where we actually do agree.</p>\n<p>QBut, Josh, everything you just said about immigration is something you could have said and, in fact, did say many times before the election.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, there is virtue in that consistency, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there?</p>\n<p>QThere is now a new reality in this town, though.\xc2\xa0 Republicans want a big victory.\xc2\xa0 They are now firmly in charge up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And they are pleading with you to take a little time to work with them before doing what is a very provocative action here, a very --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only provocative because they consider it to be provocative.\xc2\xa0 But here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, Jon --</p>\n<p>QChanging the legal status of millions of people without any congressional action is an unprecedented use of executive power in the area of immigration.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to evaluate just how unprecedented it is once the announcement has been made.</p>\n<p>But the Speaker of the House did a news conference not unlike the one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve convened here, and he was asked directly if he would commit to bringing up immigration reform any time soon, and he declined to do so.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take seriously this suggestion that Republicans actually do want to work with the President to pass immigration reform.</p>\n<p>But again, for all of -- for the virtue of our consistency, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been remarkably consistent in obstructing common-sense bipartisan efforts to reform our immigration system that everybody acknowledges is broken.</p>\n<p>So again, the question before the President is, is he going to do something that is within his authority that is also in the clear best interest of the American people and our economy.\xc2\xa0 The answer to that question is, yes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised, frankly, that Republicans would suggest that for some reason the President shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QBut just to be clear -- and I think you are loud and clear, but I just want to underline that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I try.</p>\n<p>QYou\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the President, even before he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to have his first meeting with the new Republican leadership since the election -- new in terms of newly empowered; same faces, but new positions -- even before he\xe2\x80\x99s had a chance to sit down to talk to them about it, he is completely closed to the idea of delaying this executive action, not even willing to talk to them about delaying it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to sign the -- he\xe2\x80\x99s going to take that executive action before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 But there is -- Speaker Boehner and the other members of the House Republican leadership will be arriving at the White House today with a trump card up their sleeve.\xc2\xa0 There is one thing that they can do to prevent the President from taking executive action.\xc2\xa0 The thing that they can do is they can allow that common-sense bipartisan bill from the Senate to come to the floor of the House of Representatives, and if the House passes that Senate bill, the President won\xe2\x80\x99t take executive action.\xc2\xa0 Maybe the Republic will be saved.\xc2\xa0 Maybe the ego of the House Republicans will not be bruised.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the United States of America would benefit significantly from them taking that step.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Again, this is -- the President believes he has an opportunity before him within the confines of the law to do something really good for the American public.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is, House Republicans have exactly the same opportunity.\xc2\xa0 Even if they decline to take those steps that are clearly in the best interest of the country, the President is not going to miss that opportunity.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Tamara.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QYes.\xc2\xa0 There was a Wall Street Journal piece this morning which I think some of us are referencing.\xc2\xa0 And in it, it said I think that the President in discussions with House Speaker John Boehner about immigration agreed to the piecemeal approach that Speaker Boehner would have wanted on immigration --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But doesn\'t apparently want anymore.\xc2\xa0 If you heard his news conference, yesterday, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QYes.\xc2\xa0 So did the President agree to that?\xc2\xa0 Were there substantive discussions that have happened over these months?\xc2\xa0 Was there more of a chance of something happening than us on the outside realized?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what you are assessing throughout this period.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there was successful bipartisan work in the United States Senate I think was a pretty clear indication that there is a growing majority opinion, at least, on Capitol Hill that common-sense immigration reform would be in the best interest of the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0There are all these economic analyses that indicated it would be good for the economy, that it would shrink the deficit, that it would expand economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We certainly would increase the resources at the border, so there would be a significant investment in border security.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising to me that there were a lot of Democrats and Republicans who thought that this would be a good thing for the country and something that Congress should act on.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0There were a number of conversations that took place between this administration and Democrats and Republicans in leadership positions both in the Senate and in the House.\xc2\xa0 Those conversations were obviously quite fruitful in the United States Senate.\xc2\xa0 But those conversations didn\'t lead to anything in the House -- at least with House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 That\'s unfortunate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the country that pays the price for that kind of intransigence.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to lead the President to do everything that he can to address as many problems with our broken immigration system as he can.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Now, if Republicans were to decide -- even after the first of the year -- were to decide that, look, maybe there is some legislation that we could take that would address so many of these problems that the President tried to fix on his own, the President would eagerly sit down to work with Republicans to do that.\xc2\xa0 And if we could come to an agreement that passed in bipartisan fashion through the House and in the Senate, the President would be happy to sign a bill, again, that addresses these principles that would supersede his executive action.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that the President following through and keeping his commitment to sign this executive action before the end of the year, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that that has to be the end of this debate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QThere has been all along coming from the White House -- and you\'ve repeated it today -- sort of this all-or-nothing, we want comprehensive immigration reform, take up the Senate bill.\xc2\xa0 In private, did the President agree to something less than that?\xc2\xa0 Or a different version of that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any conversations that occurred in private between the President and senior members of the Congress.\xc2\xa0 I think the operative thing simply is just that if those conversations did occur, they no longer reflect the current view of the Speaker of the House, based on what he said at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news conference.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd at 12:30 p.m., so like now, according to a press release, about 300 immigration protestors are going to be out there trying to send a message to the President.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, at basically every single event, every speech he\xe2\x80\x99s given in the last several months, he\xe2\x80\x99s been heckled by people who want changes to immigration.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it was -- on a number of occasions.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I would say every single event.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QWell, okay, a bunch.\xc2\xa0 How much has that weighed on him?\xc2\xa0 Does that pressure coming from the left, how does that balance with the red-flag-waving pressure coming from the right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think in their analogy, it\xe2\x80\x99s the President that\'s waving the flag.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor analogy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think about that.\xc2\xa0 I do think that the protests reflect a genuine frustration with Washington, D.C. about Washington\xe2\x80\x99s inability to make progress on something that is so common sense.\xc2\xa0 Again, the compromise legislation that was passed in bipartisan fashion through the United States Senate would be good for economic growth, would be good for job creation, would reduce the deficit, would strengthen border security, and would provide a path to citizenship for immigrants who are currently living in the shadows after they pay taxes, learned English, went to the back of the line.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So I think -- again, you probably would have to ask them exactly what their message is.\xc2\xa0 My sense is that message is rooted in a lot of frustration with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s inability to make progress on something that seems like such a common dose of common sense.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0The President, frankly, shares that frustration, that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t moved.\xc2\xa0 The President has accepted the view that, as the President of the United States, even though this is a problem that is sitting in front of the House of Representatives, including -- and to be specific, in front of House Republicans, the President accepts that the people assign a greater level of accountability and responsibility to the President of the United States because he\xe2\x80\x99s the most powerful man in Washington.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0That all said, I believe that these protestors did choose an opportune day to make their voices heard, because the people who are blocking these common-sense reforms actually will also be at the White House today, so I hope they speak loud and clear.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Sebastian.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QHi, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Both the President and congressional Republicans have identified corporate tax reform and trade as two of the most likely areas where they can find some common ground, but neither of those issues speak to the President\xe2\x80\x99s most steadfast supporters.\xc2\xa0 And beyond immigration, what sort of policies do you think the President will pursue in the coming months that will show committed Democrats that he\xe2\x80\x99s still with them?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you did cite a couple of areas.\xc2\xa0 And those are the areas that are most commonly cited by Republicans, where common ground could exist.\xc2\xa0 I would concede that they -- or I guess I would grant that I would agree with that assessment.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d put some other things on that list, things like investments infrastructure and investments in high-quality, early childhood education programs.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Those are the kinds of things that Republicans have also spoken about that the President has made a top priority for some time.\xc2\xa0 So I believe that there a variety of areas where Democrats and Republicans can work together to identify common ground.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that\'s interesting about this, and I did this a little at a -- I guess at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing, although it seems like a lot longer ago than that.\xc2\xa0 I would also distinguish between this idea of compromising and cooperating.\xc2\xa0 In some of the areas that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about here, Democrats and Republicans actually have the same position on some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 The best example I can cite on this is actually -- goes to infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell knows the Commonwealth of Kentucky very well.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s represented them in the United States Senate a long time.\xc2\xa0 If you were to accost him in the hallway and ask him a pop quiz of the 10 infrastructure projects that are most important to his state and would do the most to strengthen the economy in his state, he could probably rattle them off, off the top of his head.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I\xe2\x80\x99m going out on a limb to say the President would agree that those are 10 projects that are worthy of investment that would be good for the economy in the short term in terms of creating jobs, and good for the economy over the long term.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So that\'s an opportunity where -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no compromise involved in that.\xc2\xa0 Senate McConnell thinks those 10 projects should be funded.\xc2\xa0 The President thinks that those 10 projects should be funded.\xc2\xa0 So there are plenty of opportunities for us to try to cooperate on things.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0I think a similar dynamic exists when it comes to early childhood education programs.\xc2\xa0 Republicans support those programs and believe that they are worthwhile investments for the same reason that Democrats do.\xc2\xa0 So there are opportunities -- at some point, we\'re going to have to start talking about compromising.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to that.\xc2\xa0 And probably it\xe2\x80\x99s issues like the budget and some other things where we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give a little, they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to give a little, but that\'s what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take to find -- to move forward.\xc2\xa0 But there are some areas where we can just cooperate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0And the most important thing -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll end up here -- but the most important thing is to make sure that disagreements over issues like immigration don\'t interfere with our ability to find common ground on areas like investing in infrastructure and investing in early childhood education programs.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd just on immigration, what does the President think of the suggestion by David Axelrod that he should hold off on executive actions on immigration and demand that the House have an up-down vote on the Senate bill?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly would welcome an up-or- down vote of the Senate bill in the House of Representatives because we continue to be confident that if that up-or-down vote were held, that it would pass with bipartisan support, in a similar way that the bill passes with bipartisan support in the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been waiting for senator -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- for Speaker Boehner to take that step for a year and a half or so now.\xc2\xa0 And again, based on the answer that he gave at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news conference, he\xe2\x80\x99s not willing to bring it up either in the lame duck session, or in the new year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the fact is the President has the opportunity to do something really good for our economy and really good for the American people.\xc2\xa0 He can do so using the authority that he has under the law and under the Constitution of the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to take those steps before the end of the year.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Ed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QTo follow that, Josh, if Speaker Boehner had some sort of change of heart, if they have a good conversation at lunch today and he says, you know what, we\'re going to go back to that piecemeal approach that Tamara was talking about before, and showed some good faith, would the President hold back on executive action?\xc2\xa0 Is there nothing the Republicans can do that would lead the President to hold back?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You mean short of taking a vote on the bipartisan legislation that\'s already passed through the Senate?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QYes, I mean you\xe2\x80\x99ve held up the original Gang bill I suppose when you say a bipartisan bill.\xc2\xa0 But if he went back -- and I know you can\'t negotiate from there -- but if he showed some good faith, if the Republicans said, we\'re going to move on any piece of this, would the President hold back if they at least show good faith?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All signs right now point to the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness to do that.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s a hypothetical situation.\xc2\xa0 I think at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty unlikely hypothetical based only on what the Speaker himself has said, and based on the track record of their inactivity over the last year and a half.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QRepublican John Barrasso today said that he\xe2\x80\x99s not aware of anybody, Democrat or Republican, running for office in all these elections who said, I want to see the President issue more executive orders.\xc2\xa0 There were TV ads that were quite creative -- hog castration and all kinds of things.\xc2\xa0 Can you name -- is there one TV ad out there, is one candidate who said, I want to see more executive action?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, most of the people who were running these television ads were running for Congress, and so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise to me that these television ads focused on legislation that they support.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QThere were governors out there who might --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, but they were focused on state issues, right?\xc2\xa0 I assure you -- and I think this was pretty clear in the context of the 2012 election when the President was on the ballot, that he talked a lot about the steps that he had taken within the confines of the law, using his executive authority to do the right thing for the American people and to do the right thing for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0That\'s something that the President has spent a lot of time talking about in public.\xc2\xa0 This is an agenda that the President ran on in 2012.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- this is an agenda that was strongly supported by the American people when the President ran for reelection in 2012.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QTwo other quick topics.\xc2\xa0 One, do you think Loretta Lynch, as a prosecutor, has been a good public servant?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a creative way to ask about these reports, Ed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QI\xe2\x80\x99m not asking if she\xe2\x80\x99s the pick.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if you think she\xe2\x80\x99s a fine public servant.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I recognize that there are reports that she\xe2\x80\x99s a candidate, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to talk about any of the candidates from here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QLast one.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday you got several questions about Harry Reid and his chief of staff\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t repeat those.\xc2\xa0 But since then, there have also been some questions -- I see you smiling --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was smiling at Jon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 That\'s all.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QI had a feeling you were.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi has suggested to her colleagues that she\xe2\x80\x99s going to run again, and there\xe2\x80\x99s been some consternation among Democrats that -- as I think this was referred to by Steven as well yesterday -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s the same faces.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the same faces on the Republican side, too, but there are some Democrats who are saying they wish there was some sort of a shakeup there.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have full confidence in Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi?\xc2\xa0 Does he think they should both be the leaders come January and why?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of Democrats in those caucuses to decide who their leaders should be.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that Leader Reid and Leader Pelosi have tremendous track records when it comes to their success of working with this administration to advance legislations that\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to the American people and to middle-class families all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the Affordable Care Act, Wall Street reform, the Recovery Act, these are all pieces of legislation that have had a substantial positive impact on middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Those bills would not have been possible without the deft and powerful leadership of Leaders Reid and Pelosi.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Kristen.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QJosh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I want to -- the areas of compromise.\xc2\xa0 The one thing that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard you mention recently is the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about that privately, but does the President think that he can actually get a deal on the minimum wage, and would he be willing to compromise on the initial figure which he laid out, which was $10.10?\xc2\xa0 Would he come down at all if Republicans would meet him somewhere in -- the nine-dollar mark, for example?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly believes that an increase in the minimum wage is long overdue.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a number of states take action on their own to raise the minimum wage after the President started this call -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re up to 13 or 14 states now that have raised the minimum wage after the President first put this item at the top of the agenda.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0In this past election, there were five states that passed ballot initiatives that would raise the minimum wage in those states.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there is growing moment for this policy proposal that the President has championed.\xc2\xa0 I will say that there are -- whether this is an opportunity for compromise I think remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 The last time that a minimum wage passed the Congress it did so with bipartisan support and it was signed into law by a Republican President.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QIs this a priority for him, though, Josh?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QIs this something that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to bring up today at the lunch, for example?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will come up at the lunch, but giving America\xe2\x80\x99s workers a raise will continue to be a top priority of the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd just to that second point, I mean, he was adamant several months ago it should be $10.10, it should be $10.10.\xc2\xa0 Is he still wedded to that number or would he be willing to come down a little bit?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President certainly believes that America\xe2\x80\x99s minimum-wage workers deserve a raise to $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to negotiate any sort of fine points of this policy proposal from here but, look, if there are Republicans who come to the President and say we want to work with you to raise the minimum wage, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident the President will engage in those kinds of conversations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0We did see that there were a lot of Republicans who were on the ballot in these states where the voters voted in support of raising the minimum wage come out and actually endorse that proposal.\xc2\xa0 So maybe there is an opportunity for the President to work with some newly elected Republicans to make some progress on this idea.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd let me just follow up with you if I could about something that I asked Ambassador Rice about, which is the TPP.\xc2\xa0 Do you think -- what are your thoughts about Republicans now being in control?\xc2\xa0 Does that put the TPP in a stronger position of actually getting through?\xc2\xa0 And has the President figured out politically how to deal with Democrats who are opposed to the TPP or who have problems with some of it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start off with a couple of other things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that we do not anticipate that there will be a significant breakthrough in the negotiations that will be announced in the course of this trip.\xc2\xa0 That there are some very difficult negotiations that had been led by the President of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 Trade Representative, Mike Froman.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty determined negotiator and there is not an agreement that the United States is going to sign on to that isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the best interest of American workers, American businesses, America\xe2\x80\x99s farmers.\xc2\xa0 There are some important aspects, as it relates to climate change, that are being discussed in the context of these ongoing negotiations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is still a lot of work to be done there.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a lot of important progress.\xc2\xa0 I think as Ambassador Froman himself would tell you that a lot of the more difficult sticking points in these negotiations get put off until the end.\xc2\xa0 And so while the number of issues that need to be worked through has gone down, some of the more difficult issues still remain.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of an update in terms of where we are on TPP.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the meeting that the National Security Advisor announced that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be convening in Russia -- or in China on the sidelines of the APEC summit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So in terms of whether this is easy or not to get through the Congress based on the change in the majority, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say because we knew all along that any sort of congressional approval for this treaty was going to require bipartisan support; that we were going to need both Democrats and Republicans onboard to get this proposal passed.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0So is it easier to get bipartisan support when Republicans are in the majority?\xc2\xa0 Frankly, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the $64,000 question -- not just for this issue but for lots of other issues, too.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd that will be a part of today\xe2\x80\x99s lunch?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if -- well, I would anticipate that generally the President\xe2\x80\x99s support for agreements that open up overseas markets to American goods and services will be a discussion at the lunch.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if TPP or TPA would come up specifically.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Justin.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QI\xe2\x80\x99m going to circle back to something that Michelle asked you and I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure -- it was among a bunch of questions, but is there going to be a funding request specifically for anti-ISIL campaigns from the President that\xe2\x80\x99s made during this meeting or in the coming weeks?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any funding announcements to make from here, but if there\xe2\x80\x99s something like that, that is required, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAre you satisfied, I guess, with the level of funding that you have right now?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough money to successfully conduct the anti-ISIL campaign?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Defense would be in the best position to discuss this.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that they\xe2\x80\x99re carefully evaluating and the option of seeking additional resources to make sure that our men and women have the support that they need to carry out this campaign is something that the President has been focused on for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 It is something that has been the subject of a lot of the discussions the President has had with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 So stay tuned on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QAnd speaking of the national security team, I know Ambassador Rice was asked about whether she planned to stay and if there was going to be any shakeup within the national security team.\xc2\xa0 She answered the first part of that question, but the Washington Post reported today that Tony Blinken was headed over to the State Department and that there are various candidates that are being interviewed for his job right now.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if you could just update us on what\xe2\x80\x99s going on there and what the process is.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements right now on that specific issue.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President and everybody that I work with here at the White House has the highest regard for Mr. Blinken.\xc2\xa0 He has done a terrific job as the Deputy National Security Advisor and I do understand that he is being considered for some other opportunities inside the administration and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he\xe2\x80\x99d do well in any of those, too.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make from here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0Jared.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0QJosh, I also want to follow up on Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s questions about the AUMF.\xc2\xa0 When the President and congressional leaders talk about that today, will they be continuing the work that the President talked about a year and a half ago at National Defense University about revising and repealing the 2001 AUMF or is there some kind of tacit agreement among parties that that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of needed as a safety net for operations like the one against ISIS?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, you raise another dimension of these conversations that I glossed over, but you have identified it accurately.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s the question of, should we have -- should Congress pass an Authorization to Use Military Force that is updated and right-sized to reflect the ongoing counter-ISIL campaign.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a question about whether or not Congress should act in that fashion.</p>\n<p>The next question, then, is, what should be included in that Authorization to Use Military Force, what should the language be.\xc2\xa0 And then the next question, which is the one that you\xe2\x80\x99re raising, is a question related to what impact does this have on a couple of the other Authorizations to Use Military Force that Congress passed in 2001 and 2002.</p>\n<p>The President in the context of that speech made pretty clear his views on those two pieces of legislation.\xc2\xa0 But I would anticipate that this is a question that will come up and will be, ultimately, something that Congress will have to work through as well as they consider this important question.</p>\n<p>QIs the White House position, then, that those 2001, 2002 AUMFs still need to be repealed and revised to reflect current conditions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this will be the subject of discussions between senior administration officials and leaders in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of those conversations.</p>\n<p>QBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s been I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say convenient, because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about terrorism but it\xe2\x80\x99s been legally convenient for the White House to be able to point back to those authorizations and say, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need new ones.\xc2\xa0 And so that has kind of circumvented a question -- what would have probably been a difficult legislative battle over those authorizations.\xc2\xa0 I guess -- so my question is, does the White House think that as part of either in the lame duck session or early work in the 114th, that this authorization needs to be revisited?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jared, this is something that we have said and the President has said in his news conference that he wants to engage Congress on.\xc2\xa0 And so I do think that if you and I had the opportunity to negotiate this out, we could settle it pretty quickly.\xc2\xa0 Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work quite as efficiently, and there are some benefits to that inefficiency.</p>\n<p>But this is the subject of discussion between the President and his national security team and leaders in Congress who have -- obviously have vested interests in this issue.\xc2\xa0 And so I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of those conversations by talking about it from here.</p>\n<p>QBut the priorities for the White House you\xe2\x80\x99re saying haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Josh.</p>\n<p>QJust to follow up on that question, you said the President made his views pretty clear in that National Defense University speech.\xc2\xa0 Would he rule out sending up some language to the Hill?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way many presidents have done these things, it\xe2\x80\x99s the way the President did this in connection with the Syria chemical weapons situation.\xc2\xa0 Why not just draft something you guys are proposing as legislation or AUMF and if Congress wants to amend it they can?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m unclear on why the White House wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just make a proposal.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for a couple of reasons, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The first is, if we\xe2\x80\x99re actually interested in getting legislation through the Congress, sending up legislation that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already written has not exactly been a recipe for success in the Republican-dominated House of Representatives, no matter how reasonable that language might be.</p>\n<p>That said, ultimately this is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And the administration is committed to engaging with them in good faith to do something that the President believes is really important for the country.\xc2\xa0 And if there is -- if members of Congress conclude that it would be beneficial to the process for the administration to send up language, then I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we would consider.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that option off the table.\xc2\xa0 But just as -- a pragmatic perspective on this, is that legislation has had more success, at least in the last couple of Congresses, when Congress has taken the lead in drafting it.</p>\n<p>QAnd can you also address why --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And when I say \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d I just mean success in actually passing, not in terms of the policy impact.</p>\n<p>QAnd can you specify a little bit more about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s lame duck agenda is for the lame duck session of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he must want the CR to be passed; I presume he wants the language in there about training the anti-ISIL forces passed.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else he wants done specifically in the lame duck?\xc2\xa0 And just to tie that also to the AG question, if he\xe2\x80\x99s making an AG nomination, which is the higher priority?\xc2\xa0 Senator Leahy, for example -- might play a role in what happens to the AG nomination -- has signaled that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to go forward with surveillance reform legislation before moving to any nomination of that sort.\xc2\xa0 Does the President share that prioritization?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t give you a comprehensive list of every single thing that we would like to see get done.\xc2\xa0 There certainly are a lot of things.\xc2\xa0 I can give you a couple of priorities with the note that this is something that will be discussed -- well, frankly, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s being discussed right now.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ve identified the ensuring that legislation is passed to prevent a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell spoke pretty loud and clear when he said there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be a government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll find a partner here in this administration to work with them to avoid a shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have indicated, the President has indicated that we need to provide additional resources to our public health and military officials to confront Ebola; that we need to augment the resources that are available to the Department of Defense who has resources on the ground in West Africa to try and stop this outbreak at the source.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a benefit to increasing the resources that are available to medical professionals in this country to increase and improve our preparedness.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is a priority.</p>\n<p>There is a discussion about our ongoing campaign against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And as Justin pointed out -- I believe Justin raised this prospect -- that additional resources may be necessary.\xc2\xa0 So that will be a discussion of -- in the context of this meeting, and, if necessary, that would obviously be a priority for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>And I think those are -- at this point, would be the priorities.\xc2\xa0 There are a range of other things that are important.\xc2\xa0 We talked a little bit about the Title 10 authority to extend the authority that the Department of Defense has to carry out this train-and-equip mission to ensure that we are ramping up the capacity of Syrian fighters.\xc2\xa0 That obviously is something that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see extended.\xc2\xa0 That was -- Congress acted on that in the fall, but right now it is scheduled to end the second week in December, I believe.\xc2\xa0 So we certainly want to see that extended.\xc2\xa0 Ramping up the capacity of these local fighters to take the fight on the ground to ISIL in Syria remains a top priority and a core component of our strategy.\xc2\xa0 So we need to see that extended.</p>\n<p>But, again, these are the top priorities.\xc2\xa0 There could be some other priorities that emerge in the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 And obviously -- I guess the last thing I would say, without commenting on any specific nominations, there are a number of nominations that have already been sent up to Congress -- in some cases, there are many that have actually gone through the committee process.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see the Senate act on those before the end of the year, as well.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>QThanks.\xc2\xa0 There has been a Supreme Court decision here I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your comment on.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a section of the Affordable Care Act that says that tax subsidies for the purchase of insurance can only go to the states that set up exchanges.\xc2\xa0 Most of the states didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that but left it to the feds.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a technicality, but it could undermine the law.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what the Supreme Court announced on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QWhat did they announce?</p>\n<p>QThey announced that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to take it up, they\xe2\x80\x99ll consider it as a case.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been quite clear -- I got asked about this before I believe it was earlier this spring -- and Congress I think -- the congressional intent here is quite clear that they intended for eligible customers who signed up for health insurance through the marketplace to be eligible to receive assistance from the government to make their premiums more affordable.\xc2\xa0 That is, after all, one of the principal goals of the Affordable Care Act is to reduce costs for small businesses and for individuals.</p>\n<p>So I think the legislation is pretty clear about that.\xc2\xa0 I saw that there was an op-ed that ran the last couple of weeks from all the committee chairs who worked on this piece of legislation indicating and reiterating what their intent actually was, was to ensure that eligible customers would be eligible to receive the assistance from the government.\xc2\xa0 That was intended to make their health care costs more affordable.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s our view --</p>\n<p>QYou\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned -- not too concerned about this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty clear what we think -- what our view is of the law.\xc2\xa0 And I would also point out that there is pretty widespread agreement at the district and circuit court levels on this matter.\xc2\xa0 But if the Supreme Court is going to take it up, it sounds like we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity --</p>\n<p>Q-- a conflict between the circuits so there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the conflict that exists is between a circuit in Virginia, I believe, that has ruled in favor of the administration.\xc2\xa0 At the D.C. circuit, there was a three-judge opinion that went against the administration view.\xc2\xa0 But that is something that has been appealed en banc, which means that all of the judges at the D.C. circuit would consider this ruling.</p>\n<p>So again, this will work its way through the legal process.\xc2\xa0 We continue to have high confidence in the legal argument -- both from a legal perspective, but also from a common-sense perspective.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the assistance that millions of Americans have received in paying for their health care premiums has meant that millions of Americans -- in some cases for the very first time -- have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 That is -- again, that was one of the principal goals of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 This is a law that is working and has generated significant benefits for working families and small business owners all across the country. And that\'s why you\'re going to see a vigorous defense here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QThank you.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll call on you again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>QThanks.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You got a question.</p>\n<p>QYes, one more.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of social media reports, a lot of traffic about an emir in Kobani has been captured by Kurdish militia, which would be a big step for our allies in the fight against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 Is that anything Hagel talked about at the Cabinet meeting?\xc2\xa0 Or is anything you can even confirm?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those reports.\xc2\xa0 They must have broken while I\xe2\x80\x99ve been up here.</p>\n<p>Bob.</p>\n<p>QJosh, on immigration, not to be hyperbolic about it, I guess, but is this sort of a make-or-break moment, this luncheon when you consider what the President said, what you have said?\xc2\xa0 Does he want to get up from that table and realize whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go through with the threat, pull the trigger?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Bob, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a threat.\xc2\xa0 The President made a promise that he was going to act on immigration reform before the end of the year, and that\'s exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.\xc2\xa0 The one trump card that continues to exist is that House Republicans, if they want to prevent the President from taking executive action, can just bring up the compromise, bipartisan Senate bill for a vote.\xc2\xa0 The President would happily sign that into law instead of signing any executive actions on immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q Can we hear that today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We certainly would welcome that announcement from House Republicans today.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>Alexis, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q Two quick questions.\xc2\xa0 A lame duck follow-up:\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a variety of interests in the lame duck who would like to attach to the CR the ability of states to collect taxes on Internet sales.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s legislation -- a moratorium that expires.\xc2\xa0 Is the President in favor or taxes being collected by the states for Internet sales?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know this is an issue that has been discussed quite a bit on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an administration position to share with you, but we can check on it for you.</p>\n<p>Q The second thing is the person in this compound who probably has the most experience in dealing with Senator McConnell is the Vice President.\xc2\xa0 Going forward, is the President going to turn to Vice President Biden to work with the new GOP leadership in the Senate in a different way, or more frequently in maybe a more organized fashion?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that Vice President Biden is somebody who throughout the President\xe2\x80\x99s six years in office has worked very effectively with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President is somebody that has extensive personal relationships in Congress, given his own record of service in that legislative body.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to play an important role as we work with Democrats and Republicans to make progress on priorities for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say whether that will be any different than it\xe2\x80\x99s been in the past.\xc2\xa0 But I think -- I feel confident in saying that his efforts will continue to be integrated into our ongoing efforts to try to find common ground with Democrats and Republicans and move the country forward.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to --</p>\n<p>Q Josh, a lame duck follow-up?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q Quickly, is the President concerned that if he issues an executive order and he takes action without the support of congress, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to have the time in this lame duck session to give it life and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s successful immigration reform?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you do raise a good point, which is that any sort of executive action that the President would announce would require a sustained period of implementation.\xc2\xa0 And that will be something that the President will be focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of why the administration and his senior advisors, including the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security have spent so long considering exactly what these executive actions should entail.\xc2\xa0 The implementation of this will be critical, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\'s done in a week or two, but will be done over a longer time period than that.</p>\n<p>Q Does the President feel he has enough time with just two years left to make sure it has that structure?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, he does.\xc2\xa0 So with that, we obviously have a big trip to China, Burma and Australia.\xc2\xa0 Susan went through the week ahead in that context.\xc2\xa0 Currently, the President is scheduled to return to the White House on Sunday evening.\xc2\xa0 So it should be an exciting week.</p>\n<p>Q Anything Saturday?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow, you mean?\xc2\xa0 Nothing that I know of at this point.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know in the guidance tonight if there is.</p>\n<p>Q The guidance today said that there was going to be a spray at the top of this lunch.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q Did that happen?</p>\n<p>Q It just --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I sure hope so.</p>\n<p>Q Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks a lot, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Have a good weekend.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:05 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
