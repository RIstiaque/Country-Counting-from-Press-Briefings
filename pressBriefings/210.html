Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:53 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you. \xc2\xa0Let me do a quick announcement at the top and then we\'ll go to your questions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI just want to begin by noting that seven years ago today, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes. \xc2\xa0When President Obama took office in 2009, financial markets were spiraling dangerously downward and more than 750,000 Americans were losing their jobs each month. \xc2\xa0But thanks to the hard work and dedication of American workers and businesses and entrepreneurs, and of course, to the policies that the President enacted, some of which were politically controversial and hard-fought, we\'ve come a long way back.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there are a number of ways to illustrate the progress that we\'ve made so far, and I\'ve got a couple of slides here to help illustrate what a couple of those are. \xc2\xa0So, cue the slides. Look at this, we\'re going multimedia here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the slide indicates, Wall Street has made some important progress. \xc2\xa0There are a lot of ways to measure that -- everything from the S&amp;P 500 -- the year before the President took office, the S&amp;P was down 39 percent. \xc2\xa0Since then, the value of the stock market has nearly tripled. \xc2\xa0You can also measure this via economic growth. \xc2\xa0Economic output declined at an annual rate of 8.2 percent during the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- or during the last quarter of 2008, so the quarter before the President took office. \xc2\xa0And over the last year, we\'ve seen our economy grow at a healthy 2.7 percent over the last year. \xc2\xa0That obviously is an 11 percentage point turnaround, and stands in stark contrast to the GDP that\'s being posted by other countries around the world these days.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s go to the second slide. \xc2\xa0The second slide illustrates the significant improvement in the housing market since the President took office. \xc2\xa0The year before the President entered office, home prices had declined 8 percent. \xc2\xa0In that time, we\'ve seen the housing market continue to recover and home prices are now back to pre-crisis levels and just last year rose another 5 percent. \xc2\xa0So many middle-class families rely on the value of their home as an important part of their household wealth, so the improvement in the housing market is significant.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s go to the third and last slide, which talks about job growth. \xc2\xa0And this is our most commonly cited set of statistics. \xc2\xa0But again, before the President took office, the year before the President took office, our economy lost 4.6 million private sector jobs, but since then we\'ve been on the longest sustained streak of private sector job creation, for a total of 13.1 million private sector jobs created since February of 2010. \xc2\xa0And the overall employment rate has been cut nearly in half, from the high of 10 percent down to 5.1 percent today. \xc2\xa0That\'s the lowest level in more than seven years.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you look at this progress, it seems in stark contrast to what we are seeing from Republicans on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0Instead of playing games with our economic progress and imposing another set of self-inflicted wounds, Republicans need to do the job that voters have asked them to do, and that is to pass a budget that reverses the harmful cuts known as the sequester, and of course, avoids another government shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will make this case tomorrow when he speaks with and takes questions at the quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable right here in Washington, D.C. \xc2\xa0The President will make the case to Congress that we cannot afford to reverse course in the progress that we\'ve seen by playing games with the budget. And it\'s critical that we increase investments in infrastructure, that we support American jobs through Made in America exports, that we strengthen education and innovation, and fight to undermine -- or fight efforts to undermine Wall Street reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\'s something to look forward to tomorrow. \xc2\xa0The President will speak and take questions at the Business Roundtable, and that will be open to traveling press pool, so all of you will have the opportunity to see it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that long windup, Nancy, thanks for your patience. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s go to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple things on the migrant situation. \xc2\xa0With the situation on the border in Hungary and elsewhere getting increasingly desperate, what is the U.S. position on mandatory quotas? \xc2\xa0And is the U.S. involved in trying to resolve the differences between different countries there about how to deal with the crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nancy, it is clear that our friends and allies in Europe are dealing with a significant humanitarian crisis, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no downplaying the human cost of the instability in Syria that has led to millions of people fleeing their homes and their communities, trying to escape the terrible violence. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s led to an urgent humanitarian situation in Europe now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou have heard me offer compliments to countries like Germany that have, both on the part of their government and their citizens, recognized the humanity of those in their midst who are suffering and tried to provide for their basic humanitarian needs. \xc2\xa0And ultimately it will be the responsibility of the nations of Europe and members of the EU to work together to confront this problem. \xc2\xa0There is tremendous capacity in the EU, both economically and otherwise, to address this problem, but they will be more effective in confronting this problem if they act together. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific conversations to tell you about at this point, but there certainly are administration officials that have been in touch with those in Europe and in the region who are dealing with this crisis firsthand. \xc2\xa0And the United States is committed to our role in this, which is to provide significant financial assistance to meeting the basic humanitarian needs of those who are in this vulnerable position, these migrants.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States continues to be the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to this crisis. \xc2\xa0The President has indicated that next year he would like to see us scale up the number of Syrian refugees that are admitted to this country, a minimum of 10,000 next year. \xc2\xa0And the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team is continuing to work on other ways that the United States can continue to play a leading role in confronting this significant international crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he have a position on the mandatory quotas, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ultimately, it will be the responsibility of the nations in Europe to determine that best way to work together to confront this crisis. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some countries -- Germany is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s gotten the most attention, and I think deservedly so, for the kind of generosity that they have already demonstrated in taking in so many migrants. \xc2\xa0And it will be important for other countries to stand with Germany as they deal with the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then, on Russia. \xc2\xa0President Putin said today that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to defeat the Islamic State without cooperating with the regime in Damascus -- with signs that Moscow is planning to set up an airbase in Syria. \xc2\xa0You mentioned yesterday that at the appropriate time there could be a presidential conversation. Do you have a sense of how imminent or not the appropriate time might be for a conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When our team and, most importantly, when the President has determined that it would advance our interests to have a conversation with President Putin, he\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up the phone and try to set up that call.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has made quite clear that the decision of the Russians to double down on the leadership of Bashar al-Assad is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is that we have seen over the years that because of his failed leadership and because of his willingness to slaughter innocent people using the mechanics of that country\xe2\x80\x99s military, he\xe2\x80\x99s lost the legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0And we have made clear that the solution -- despite the decision of the Russians to build up their military -- the solution in Syria requires a diplomatic strategy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the United States has worked hard to support the U.N.-led efforts to facilitate a democratic political transition inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty forthright, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been paying attention, that those efforts haven\xe2\x80\x99t gained nearly as much traction as we would like. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s significant work to be done in this area.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we would prefer to see from the Russians is a more constructive engagement with the 60-member coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s led by the United States, that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0We would welcome Russia\xe2\x80\x99s participation in that effort. \xc2\xa0And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, we continue to believe that their efforts to support Assad and continue to offer him support are destabilizing and counterproductive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just finally, on politics. \xc2\xa0How interested is the President in kind of the nitty-gritty of the GOP race? \xc2\xa0And is he planning to watch the debate tomorrow night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think even hearing some of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments at the town hall meeting yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s apparent that he is following the race. \xc2\xa0He is at least a keenly interested observer to that process. \xc2\xa0But I would not anticipate that the President will watch the debate tomorrow night. \xc2\xa0The first one was held back in August, and to the disbelief of some, the President did not watch that debate. \xc2\xa0I do not anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll watch tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s either. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he will read the news coverage and be aware of the arguments that are made in that setting.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, North Korea said today that its nuclear complex was operating and it was working to improve the quality and quantity of its weapons so that they could use them against the United States. \xc2\xa0What is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the reporting that indicates the readjustment in operation of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, including the 5-megawatt plutonium reactor and the uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon. \xc2\xa0We will repeat our call that North Korea should refrain from irresponsible provocations that aggravate regional tensions, and should focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe position of the United States -- and this is a position that is shared by countries around the world, including significant players in the region -- is that we will not accept North Korea as a nuclear state. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we urge North Korea to refrain from actions and rhetoric that threaten regional peace and security, and focus instead on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we will work with our partners in the context of the Six-Party talks to try to return North Korea to a posture of fulfilling those commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the context of those conversations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How seriously do you take their threats?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly aware of the actions that North Korea has taken, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have a specific reaction to those actions, other than saying that North Korea should refrain from irresponsible provocations that serve only to aggravate regional tensions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a separate topic, GE said today that it\xe2\x80\x99s moving 500 U.S. power turbine manufacturing jobs to Europe because of an inability to get Ex-Im funding. \xc2\xa0Now, I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see this is a reason Republicans should allow the Bank to continue. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m also curious to know if you are disappointed in GE for doing this instead of waiting to see how the political process plays out.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jeff, I won\xe2\x80\x99t handicap individual business decisions. \xc2\xa0Obviously there are a range of factors that influence how those decisions are reached. \xc2\xa0But I do think it serves as an illustration that there are real-world consequences for congressional inaction. \xc2\xa0And we have seen Republicans counter decades of bipartisan agreement and bipartisan support for the Export-Import Bank. \xc2\xa0And their failure to confront this situation in a timely fashion and to allow some of the funding for the Export-Import Bank to lapse has affected business decisions that are going to impact jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we hear a lot about Republicans complaining about supposedly job-killing regulations. \xc2\xa0The fact is it seems like, based on what GE has reported today, that Republicans are killing quite a few jobs on their own. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, getting back to Syria, there are reports that Russia is sending battle tanks to a new airbase in Syria. \xc2\xa0I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the President will talk to President Putin at the appropriate time, but does the United States view this as a provocation in that region? \xc2\xa0And what do you make of what Putin is up to? \xc2\xa0Is he banking on Assad to defeat ISIS rather than the Syrian opposition that you\xe2\x80\x99ve invested in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jim, the deployment of military assets that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited is the assessment of the Department of Defense, so for specific questions about that I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that a provocation, though?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what it is, is it\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that further support, military or otherwise, for the Assad regime is destabilizing and counterproductive, principally because Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that Assad is actually losing territory, that the latest analysis indicates that he continues to govern at, least nominally, territory that\xe2\x80\x99s shrinking in size. \xc2\xa0And again, that is why the President indicated that doubling down on Assad -- or Russia\xe2\x80\x99s decision to double down on Assad is a losing bet. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we would rather see is the Russians offer up some kind of constructive cooperation with the 60-member anti-ISIL coalition that\xe2\x80\x99s built by the United States and focused on degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. \xc2\xa0The Russians indicate that they share that goal, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them work cooperatively with the rest of the international community to advance it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And even though Assad has perpetrated some ungodly acts in Syria, in terms of a more effective fighting force in terms of taking on ISIS, is Putin going with perhaps the more effective fighting force? \xc2\xa0Is that a decision that you think that he\xe2\x80\x99s making here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0A close look at the facts on the ground does not substantiate the claim that the Assad fighting force is effectively advancing the interests of President Assad. \xc2\xa0Again, the amount of territory that they\xe2\x80\x99re defending is shrinking. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of reasons for that, including the willingness of the Assad regime to engage in indiscriminate acts of violence against the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a lot of -- I\xe2\x80\x99m confident there are a lot of factors that go into President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the situation. \xc2\xa0But I think what most observers have acknowledged is that President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power is weakening, and for many of the reasons that we\xe2\x80\x99re --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the tactical decision that President Putin is making you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s making a strategic decision to double down on his support for the Assad regime, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a losing bet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And on China, The Washington Post is reporting that the administration is holding off on sanctions against Chinese entities prior to President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit here. \xc2\xa0Is that accurate? \xc2\xa0And I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult question to answer because the administration has still not said publicly that China was behind the OPM hack, and I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just curious, what\xe2\x80\x99s the holdup with holding the Chinese accountable for their actions in cyber security?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jim, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve indicated before, we are not likely to spend time talking about our plan to implement sanctions prior to their implementation. \xc2\xa0And the reason for that is we do not want to give those who may be the target of those sanctions the opportunity to plan -- or carry out a strategy to evade those sanctions before they\xe2\x80\x99re even implemented. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have withheld comment on specific reports about our plans to implement sanctions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will say is that the only reason we\xe2\x80\x99re having this discussion is because earlier this year the President initiated a policy change that delegated authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to impose economic sanctions against entities that engage in bad behavior in cyberspace or benefit from that behavior. \xc2\xa0And I think what we know about the tool of economic sanctions is that it can serve as a pretty effective deterrent, even if it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already been implemented; that merely having this response tool in our arsenal can advance the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously continue to monitor this situation, and I think there are a number of steps that the United States has taken, including engaging directly between the two Presidents, from President Obama to his counterpart, raising significant concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s activity in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall last year that five Chinese military officials were indicted by the United States Department of Justice for their actions in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear to the public that this is an issue that the United States and the Obama administration take seriously, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear to the Chinese government that this is an issue that we take seriously, as evidenced by the decision of the Chinese President to send Secretary Meng to the United States to meet with a range of U.S. officials in advance of his visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But just this morning your administration announced China\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation and some advancements that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made with respect to climate change and acting on the climate pact that the President reached last year. \xc2\xa0Is it difficult to issue sanctions or prosecute Chinese entities for these acts when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got these other big-ticket items at stake?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that complication. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty easily described that there are some areas where we\xe2\x80\x99re able to cooperate effectively with the Chinese to advance the interests of the citizens of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the climate announcement that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just cited or trying to build international consensus around confronting Iran of their nuclear program -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that China was a constructive partner in the P5+1 efforts; we even have some effective cooperation with China when it comes to containing the threat that is posed by North Korea and trying to de-nuclearize the Korean Peninsula.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of areas where we can work effectively with the Chinese to advance the interests of the American people but also the Chinese people. \xc2\xa0But that certainly in no way diminishes the significance of the concerns that we do have with some of China\xe2\x80\x99s policy decisions. \xc2\xa0And whether that is their activity in cyberspace or the concerns that we have about their lack of respect for basic human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And last thing -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on too long, but is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that Hillary --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone on too long. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that Hillary Clinton is struggling right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the President\xe2\x80\x99s view. \xc2\xa0As I\xe2\x80\x99ve conveyed to you, it\xe2\x80\x99s unwise to draw significant conclusions about the outcome of an election 15 months before it\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled to be held.</p>\n<p>\n\tCheryl.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh, and I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the President is going to be talking about budget and spending bills tomorrow, but there are some Democrats on Capitol Hill who say that the President should not sign even a short-term CR unless budget negotiations actually start. \xc2\xa0What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on when negotiations really need to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Cheryl, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that, as I described at some length before this briefing started, our economy has made a lot of important progress over the last seven years, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because primarily of the grit and determination of the American work force and American business leaders and entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s our private sector that has led this recovery, and the American people can feel good about the momentum that we have built up.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the last thing that this momentum needs is to be undermined by dysfunction in the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0And we\'ve seen that once before, as recently as two years ago, when Republicans led the effort to shut down the government in protest over the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0It would be a shame for Republicans to marshal a similar effort for any reason. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is the Congress has a basic responsibility to pass a budget on an annual basis to fund the government at appropriate levels. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why the administration has regularly, even daily in the context of these briefings, suggested that Republican leaders in Congress should accept the offer from Democrats in Congress to negotiate a bipartisan budget agreement that would both avoid a government shutdown but also make sure that our nation\xe2\x80\x99s priorities when it comes to both our economy and our national security are adequately funded.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, but we\'re barely two weeks till the end of the fiscal year. \xc2\xa0What day would you say we need to start before it\'s just dragged on too long?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it already has dragged on too long. \xc2\xa0We have been suggesting that these negotiations take place for months now. \xc2\xa0Last time, back in 2013, the last time Republicans shut down the government, we actually had to go through two or two and a half weeks of a shutdown before Republicans engaged in serious negotiations with Democrats. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had hoped that Republicans would be able to be willing to negotiate with Democrats prior to a government shutdown, as opposed to after a government shutdown. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll have to see. \xc2\xa0That will ultimately be the responsibility of Republican leaders in Congress to decide whether or not they can demonstrate to the American people that they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of leading the Congress. \xc2\xa0And prompting a second government shutdown in two years I think is going to raise some significant doubts about their ability to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First I wanted to look back on the answer that you gave to Jim. \xc2\xa0It sounded like you snuck a new line about deterrence and sanctions in there. \xc2\xa0And what I\'m curious about is in the context of the talks that happened with Ambassador Rice and other officials over the weekend -- if the U.S. got any assurances from China either on the activity in cyberspace that has raised some concern here, or the viability of an agreement between the U.S. and China on cyber activities, on data theft, on kind of these -- was there some sort of breakthrough or significant progress made that might be solidified in the talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t have a more detailed readout of those conversations to share with you. \xc2\xa0I think we made clear that the concerns that we have about China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in cyberspace were discussed bluntly by those American officials who participated in those conversations. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that when President Obama next has the opportunity to have a conversation with his counterpart that the President will be just as direct in conveying his concerns about the way that China has pursued some of that activity in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt will not be the first time the President has raised those concerns. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President has raised those concerns in each of the previous meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s had with President Xi. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reference that I made to the value of deterrence is something that I am discussing for the first time in this context, but as someone pointed out to me earlier today, we\'ve used economic sanctions effectively in a variety of other areas, as recently in confronting Iran over their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And we did discuss how the threat of additional sanctions did serve as a useful way to apply pressure to Iran to further isolate them and to advance our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t mean to introduce a new factor here, but rather to sort of draw a connection about the philosophy that we\xe2\x80\x99d pursue when considering the implementation of additional sanctions to advance the interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about a pair of phone calls the Vice President had with some foreign leaders. \xc2\xa0The first one is, yesterday, he said in a conversation with his counterpart in Montenegro that the U.S. was ready to back their invitation to NATO. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, obviously, this is probably going to draw some concern in Moscow, and if you could talk about the intentionality of making this announcement in the context of what Russia has been doing in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0my understanding is that there has been a policy process behind that decision that\xe2\x80\x99s been ongoing for quite some time. \xc2\xa0And the United States has talked -- the President has talked on a number of occasions about how central the NATO alliance is to not just the national security of the United States but to broader stability in the North Atlantic region. \xc2\xa0And the United States has enjoyed a lot of security cooperation from Montenegro in the past, and that sort of explains the lead-up to this policy decision that the Montenegrin leader was informed of yesterday by the Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On a separate call today the King of Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s office said that he urged the Vice President to have the administration speak more bluntly about your stance on Israeli police action against Palestinian protestors at the Temple Mount, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk about where you guys are kind of on that situation as it\xe2\x80\x99s been developing.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, the United States remains deeply concerned by the recent violence and escalating tensions surrounding Haram al-Sharif, or the Temple Mount, as it\xe2\x80\x99s also known. \xc2\xa0The United States, as we routinely do, strongly condemn all acts of violence, particularly in that location that\xe2\x80\x99s so sacred to many, many people.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is absolutely critical that all sides exercise restraint, refrain from provocative actions and rhetoric, and preserve unchanged the historic status quo on the Haram al-Sharif Temple Mount, both in word and in practice. \xc2\xa0And that has been the long-held position of the United States. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a position that has been conveyed to all parties in this ongoing disturbance. \xc2\xa0And that is the message that the Vice President conveyed to King Abdullah, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last potential fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand, but Senator Hoevan, having struck out on his summertime prediction on the Keystone pipeline, has said now that the administration is --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one. \xc2\xa0He can take some solace in that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- that the administration is waiting until after the Canadian elections. \xc2\xa0I know this has come up before, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you had anything fresh on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new in terms of timing, but the State Department may so you can check with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a couple of follow-ups, one, on the question of the short-term CR. \xc2\xa0Is the President willing to sign a short-term funding to allow negotiations to go forward that would extend current government funding levels?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Jon, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate right now on what Congress may eventually do. \xc2\xa0We have made clear what our priorities are, which are to prevent a government shutdown, to make sure that our national security and economic priorities are adequately funded, and to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t lock in over the long term the sequester budget levels that right now inadequately fund our national security and economic priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you don\xe2\x80\x99t rule out locking that in for a short term?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to -- well, I guess the -- I think we would perceive an internal contradiction between the words \xe2\x80\x9cshort term\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clock in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And then a follow-up on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions in Syria. \xc2\xa0U.S. policy is still that Assad needs to go, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is the policy of the United States, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Also to degrade and destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is the higher priority?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think both of these are priorities, principally because the reason that ISIL has been able to grow both in terms of the area they control and in their stature in the region is a direct result of the failed leadership of Bashar al-Assad. \xc2\xa0So you have identified two policies of the United States government, but they are not disconnected; that one is -- the failed leadership of President Assad has had an impact and has contributed significantly to the growth of ISIL. \xc2\xa0So those two things are related.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So I guess the same answer if I ask you what\xe2\x80\x99s the greater threat to the United States, Assad continuing to be in power in parts of Syria he controls, or ISIL?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously, the risk to U.S. interests is different, but the fact is resolving both of these concerns would advance our interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what do you assess, what does the administration assess is Russia\xe2\x80\x99s goal here? \xc2\xa0Are they -- publicly they say this is about fighting terrorism and battling ISIL. \xc2\xa0Are they trying to prop up Assad for another reason, or is that truly their reason? \xc2\xa0Or do you think that Russia has a longer game here they\xe2\x80\x99re playing to expand their influence and power in the Middle East?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, this would not be the first situation in which President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s true motivations are rather hard to discern. \xc2\xa0The decision-making process in that country is rather opaque, but there are a couple of thing that we do know. \xc2\xa0Russia does have longstanding concerns about the spread of violent extremism and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the failed leadership of Assad has contributed to the spread of violent extremism in Syria and Iraq and even increased the risk in other countries, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know also that Russia has viewed Syria as essentially their client state in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0That is a relationship that Russia has enjoyed at least for quite some time and it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that we know that Russia already has some significant military assets in Syria already. \xc2\xa0And so this latest military buildup is only to build on those assets and presumably to complement those assets that are already in place inside Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that longstanding client-state relationship might lead one to conclude that President Putin is factoring into this equation some long-term considerations. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear exactly what he believes is the best way for him to advance those longer-term interests that Russia may have inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0The case that we have made -- both publicly and privately in the context of at least a couple of phone calls between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov -- is that it would advance the interests of the world for Russia to be a part of this anti-ISIL coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL -- to contribute, constructively to that effort, but also to support the kind of political transition in Syria that we believe is necessary to solve the underlying problem that has led to both the growth of ISIL, the expansion of violence, and a terrible humanitarian crisis that\xe2\x80\x99s caused millions of people to flee their homes inside Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last question. \xc2\xa0In terms of the possibility of a phone call between the President and Putin, Putin is obviously going to be in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. \xc2\xa0This President has, on the international stage, been a longtime advocate of engagement. \xc2\xa0Why would he not meet with Putin while he is going to be right here in New York in the same city? \xc2\xa0Why would they not meet?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for his trip to New York is still in flux and so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more to say once that schedule has been arranged. \xc2\xa0And certainly there is the possibility that the two leaders could meet while they\xe2\x80\x99re there because they are likely to be there at the same time. \xc2\xa0At the same time, the President has a number of other commitments in New York while he\xe2\x80\x99s there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Putin has already said that he would like to meet -- he\xe2\x80\x99s open to meeting with the President in New York.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, and again, I think the President has indicated that he has benefitted from regular conversations with President Putin. \xc2\xa0They obviously disagree on most of the issues that they discuss, but at least they can discuss them in a candid, pretty businesslike format or environment. \xc2\xa0And so, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think I would expressly not rule out necessarily a presidential conversation sometime soon. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\'t have updates on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I don\'t want to assume -- this is why I\'m asking you -- why is the President not going to watch the debate tomorrow night?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess because he feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s got better things to do. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0With all due respect to CNN, Jim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\'s fine. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I think the viewership will be okay. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I suspect that\'s correct. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I ask that because you use the word \xe2\x80\x9chuman\xe2\x80\x9d -- watching this presidential dynamic, the wannabes who want to be in his office right now human and I find it interesting that he won\'t watch since he\xe2\x80\x99s keenly aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, on the GOP side and I guess the Democratic side. \xc2\xa0Can you elaborate a little bit more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President understands probably better than any other American that elections have consequences, and that the kinds of discussions about the future of the country that will take place over the next 15 months or so are critically important as Americans decide the next person that should sit in the Oval Office just down the hall here. \xc2\xa0And there are big consequences for that, particularly as it relates to the vision that this President has for the future of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is very invested in seeing the kinds of values and priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s championed be supported by the next President. \xc2\xa0And obviously there will be a pretty robust debate about the best way to do that. \xc2\xa0There are some -- there are a variety of points of view that will be offered up both in the Democratic and Republican primaries, and then we\'ll also have a pretty vigorous national debate in the context of the general election. \xc2\xa0All of that is evidence of a very healthy democracy in this country, and the President is pleased that we can have a robust political debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, the President understands the stakes of those debates better than most because he\xe2\x80\x99s been through this process himself twice now. \xc2\xa0So he certainly understands why this is important, and that\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s paying attention. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thinking back to then-presidential candidate the first time, Barack Obama, do you think that he lived up to his pledge of hope and change since he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office twice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely. \xc2\xa0There probably is a really long answer to that question -- I\'ll try to keep it short -- which is I think the opening of the briefing today is one powerful illustration of the tremendously important economic progress that this country has made under the leadership of President Obama. \xc2\xa0Again, I would be the first person -- actually, the President would be the first person to give the bulk of that credit to the American people and to American workers and to American entrepreneurs. \xc2\xa0But there is no denying that this President made some risky, politically unpopular bets, but the President had confidence in those bets because he was betting on the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd whether that was a decision to invest in the Recovery Act, or to invest and rescue the auto industry, the American economy has benefitted tremendously from those difficult and, in some cases, very politically unpopular decisions that the President made. \xc2\xa0But they paid off for the U.S. economy and for the American people. \xc2\xa0And the President is proud of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one last question -- going back to one of your answers to one of my questions, you had a statement basically saying the President is concerned with some of the rhetoric that\'s out there that\'s kind of walked away or moving away from his policies. \xc2\xa0What are -- can you articulate specifically some of his concerns in listening to this rhetoric that he\xe2\x80\x99s hearing on Democratic and Republican side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t think there is anything that I\'d single out at this point, but I do -- in the context of the town hall meeting that the President convened in Des Moines just yesterday, somebody asked the question about -- asked the President a question about immigration reform and immigration policy. \xc2\xa0And the President made clear his concerns about some of the rhetoric that\'s thrown about on the Republican side when describing the contribution of immigrants to our country. \xc2\xa0The President has been quite disappointed in that rhetoric and he made that clear yesterday. \xc2\xa0That\'s only one example.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Perhaps speaking about Donald Trump, specifically or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is speaking to the rhetoric that is used by an alarming number of Republican candidates.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to follow up on your comments about cyber terrorism and cyber spying as it relates to China. \xc2\xa0And I know that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics about individuals or even companies that may ultimately be sanctioned, but I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about, broadly speaking, what might sanctions look like, what type of sanctions are we talking about, and how they might have teeth, if you will.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, I think for a detailed analysis of this, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department. \xc2\xa0But traditionally, what economic sanctions refers to is targeting a set of individuals for a variety of reasons -- in this case it would be because they either engaged in inappropriate or deeply concerning cyber activity, or they benefited from it. \xc2\xa0And essentially, these individuals would have their access to the U.S. financial system either severely limited or entirely shut off.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because of the preeminent role that the U.S. financial and banking system plays in the international economy, that can have some pretty serious consequences for those individuals or for those entities. \xc2\xa0And again, that is one way that the strength of the U.S. economy and our influence around the world can be leveraged to advance our interests around the world, even in a setting that, in some cases, isn\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to the economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So is it a threat, is it a warning when President Xi comes? \xc2\xa0Is the President essentially saying, knock it off or else? \xc2\xa0How does that conversation play out in your mind?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the conversation plays out I think in the same way that it has the two previous times -- or at least the two previous times that I can recall that the President met with President Xi and directly raised these issues, and that is the President will speak directly with President Xi about the specific concerns that we have with the kind of activity that we see emanating from China. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President has found it particularly constructive to be offering or posing or making specific threats in the Oval Office. \xc2\xa0But everyone is aware of the range of options that the President has for confronting this particular problem. \xc2\xa0There is no doubt in the mind of leaders of the Chinese government that President Obama takes this issue very seriously and is willing to speak directly and act decisively to confront it. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will do in the context of this meeting as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance it will ultimately scuttle the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Washington?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly -- I mean, at this point I would hope not. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to discuss. \xc2\xa0And again, there are a range of issues. \xc2\xa0This is certainly an important one and a genuine priority, and one that we continue to be quite concerned about. \xc2\xa0But the announcement that was made today, the commitment on the part of a number of Chinese cities and provinces to cap their carbon pollution, is a significant announcement and has significant consequences and benefits for American interests and the American people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were corresponding commitments that were made by American cities as well. \xc2\xa0And this is an example of how the United States and China can work together to advance our interests. \xc2\xa0The same thing was true when it came to the Iran negotiations, and that was -- China played a very constructive role there. \xc2\xa0So there is an opportunity for us -- and I think that the Chinese leaders would say that the diplomatic resolution to that situation is in the interest of the Chinese people as well. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a case that the President has obviously made to the American people and even to our Israeli allies. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Chinese officials feel the same way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are they lying when they say the U.S. is cyber-spying on them as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly would not -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be appropriate, at least in this context, for me to use that kind of label against the leaders of China. \xc2\xa0But what I think I would also say is I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot to say about any activity that may or may not be engaged in by the United States in that regard. \xc2\xa0But we have been quite clear that the United States does not engage in the kind of cyber activity that yields a significant financial benefit for American companies. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely the kind of behavior and activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised concerns about with regard to China.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one -- California fires. \xc2\xa0Any update on that? \xc2\xa0Has the President been briefed? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a massive problem there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Kevin, this is a significant problem, and this is one that the President has been focused on. \xc2\xa0And we may have a little bit more news on this later today, but you have seen that the Obama administration had made a specific request of Congress to change the funding mechanism for wildfires and the response to wildfires. \xc2\xa0Right now, you essentially have a situation where both the Forest Service and some elements of the Department of Interior are using funding that was originally dedicated to preventing forest fires to actually fight the forest fires. \xc2\xa0And that ends up being a flawed strategy, because the less that we can devote to wildfire prevention, the more that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to dedicate to firefighting. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we made a specific request of Congress to change that funding mechanism so that we can protect the important programs that go toward preventing wildfires while also making sure we have all the resources that we need to assist state and local firefighters who are trying to protect lives and property out West.</p>\n<p>\n\tPam.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, following up on the Montenegro issue, Russia has made it pretty clear that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see any NATO expansion, especially in the East. \xc2\xa0Could they view that as a provocation, maybe an in-your-face kind of thing -- the fact that the U.S. has given conditional support to Montenegro to join NATO? \xc2\xa0And wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Western Ukraine sort of interest in the West a reason why Russia got involved -- intervened in Ukraine?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be direct about answering your question, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the Russians will perceive it. \xc2\xa0What I would say to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s interested in understanding exactly this policy decision is I would assure them that this is a policy decision that went through the regular process and took some time to arrive at. \xc2\xa0So this is not an effort to respond to any particular action that\xe2\x80\x99s taken by any other country, but rather a policy decision that is grounded in the long-term best interests of the United States. \xc2\xa0And again, that was a decision that was conveyed to the Montenegrin leader just yesterday by the Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there any concern it could provoke a negative reaction from Russia if it does get into NATO?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible, but that would be a decision that is made by the Russians. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about what our intentions are and how the strength of NATO has contributed to not just the national security interests of the United States but has been a bedrock of a peaceful and unified Europe for a couple generations now.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just a quick one. \xc2\xa0There was recently a U.N. human rights report that came out saying 8,000 people have been killed in eastern Ukraine since, I guess, a year ago, April, and that the situation really was getting worse in terms of civilians dying, and that more needed to be done to stop the violence. \xc2\xa0Is there any thought to ratcheting up the sanctions on Russia for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the United States has coordinated effectively with our European counterparts to apply pressure to the Russians because of their destabilizing activities in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0And there are a raft of economic figures that I could point you to that are moving in the opposite directions from the statistics that I cited at the beginning of this briefing. \xc2\xa0And part of the reason for that is because of the increasing international economic isolation of the Russian leadership and the Russian economy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s had consequences for them. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s had consequences for their private investment environment. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s had consequences for the value of their currency. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s had consequences for projections about the future growth of their economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the United States and Russia -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- the United States and Europe have been able to effectively coordinate our actions to impose costs on Russia for their destabilizing activities in Ukraine. \xc2\xa0At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been pretty candid about the fact that those costs have not yet resulted in the kinds of strategic decisions that we would like to see from President Putin. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Russia faces increasing international isolation. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any new sanctions policy that will be announced in the near term, but what we have said is that the longer that these sanctions remain in place, the more isolated and the more bite these sanctions end up having on the Russian economy. \xc2\xa0And again, that is a direct result of the strategic decisions that are being made by President Putin. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been just as clear that if the Russians are prepared to start living up to the commitments that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the context of multilateral talks in Minsk that the United States and European community would be prepared to start rolling back those sanctions. \xc2\xa0But again, that will require Russia to make the kind of decision to depart from the destabilizing activities that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been pursuing in Ukraine for quite some time now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said the White House position is still that Assad must go. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could drill down a little bit, because some of America\xe2\x80\x99s allies in this fight -- the U.K. and others -- have evolved in their view, saying that Assad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to go on day one, that he can be part of the transition. \xc2\xa0Is that also your understanding of where the U.S. is when it says Assad must go?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the position that we have made clear is that we do believe that Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country and we need to facilitate a political transition inside of Syria that results in Assad\xe2\x80\x99s departure. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s lost legitimacy to lead that country. \xc2\xa0There is a U.N.-led process to try to pursue this diplomatic transition. \xc2\xa0And despite the strong support of the United States, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that process gain the kind of traction that we would like.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that continues to be our -- but that does continue to be our goal, principally because it\xe2\x80\x99s just not feasible for a leader like Assad to remain in power while he\xe2\x80\x99s also using the military of that country to drop bombs indiscriminately on his own people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So to clarify, you\xe2\x80\x99re not ruling out that he could be part of a transition if the agreement is that he\xe2\x80\x99ll ultimately exit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we have made clear is that a political transition is necessary, and Assad\xe2\x80\x99s departure is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to happen before the other.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a U.N.-led process to try to determine -- to try to effectuate that kind of political transition. \xc2\xa0And unfortunately, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a lot of progress in that regard. \xc2\xa0But it has not diminished either the United States\xe2\x80\x99 support for that process, or our belief that the only way that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to resolve all of the terrible consequences stemming from Assad\xe2\x80\x99s failed leadership without that kind of U.N.-facilitate political transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To go then to the refugee crisis, because, as you\xe2\x80\x99re saying, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of frustration that you\xe2\x80\x99re just not in any kind of conversation diplomatically to make that transition happen. \xc2\xa0So if that\xe2\x80\x99s the path to ending the war, that\xe2\x80\x99s not having much success. \xc2\xa0You have this hemorrhage of people into Europe and the neighboring countries, so is there any thought of revisiting the White House decision and looking at establishing some kind of safe haven within the border of Syria so that people don\xe2\x80\x99t have to flee it in order to find safety? \xc2\xa0Any kind of version of a safe haven?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Those who know a whole lot more about Syria than I do I\xe2\x80\x99m sure would confidently describe the situation in Syria as chaotic. \xc2\xa0And that has had a corresponding impact that you would expect on the security situation in that country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the focus of our efforts right now is to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0And there has been important progress that counter-ISIL fighters have made in driving ISIL out of significant portions of Syria, particularly along the border with Turkey. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s been important progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult closely and work effectively with the Turks, who are rightly concerned about the security situation along their border. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But there is a perception among other departments in Washington that when it comes to the conversation of a safe zone that while there are those who support it, that conversation ends when it gets to the White House. \xc2\xa0Is the White House in any way revisiting any of those policy decisions on Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I guess to take on that question directly, because of some of the challenges that are posed by Syria, particularly when it comes to trying to see the kind of political outcome that we would like to see there and to stabilize the security situation, that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been very challenging. \xc2\xa0And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t made as much progress in pursuit of those goals as we would like to see. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is always pushing his team to bring him new ideas and to get an updated assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s exactly happening on the ground so that if there are policy changes that need to be implemented, that those changes can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that there would be further refinements of our strategy based on what we know is working on the ground. \xc2\xa0And, again, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that already by enlisting a significantly greater contribution from the Turks to this effort. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s just one example of how the President and his team are constantly reviewing our strategy when it comes to Syria to look for ways that we can advance our interests more effectively than we have thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The House looks likely to vote on a bill lifting the ban on oil exports. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have a position on this bill and the topic in general?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I can tell you, Byron, is that the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a position on this, which is that this is a policy decision that is made over at the Commerce Department. \xc2\xa0And for that reason, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t support legislation like the one that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward by Republicans. \xc2\xa0And so this is -- so for an update on our position, if one is necessary, you can consult with the Commerce Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one thing that I would note is that this policy announcement is being made by Leader McCarthy in front of an organization in Houston that is largely funded by four or five of the biggest oil companies in the United States. \xc2\xa0So it is pretty clear, once again, where Republicans in Congress and their political benefactors stand when it comes to their energy policy priorities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is I think Leader McCarthy has an opportunity to demonstrate some true political courage where he could go and stand before that organization and actually offer up something bold but also common-sense, which is to end the billions in subsidies that oil and gas companies in the United States already enjoy, and actually use that money to ensure the long-term success of our economy and the energy sector in this country by making important investments in things like wind energy and solar energy -- investments that even some of those oil companies themselves have bragged about making.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0And can I follow on Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question? \xc2\xa0You said you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly reviewing your strategy. \xc2\xa0Is there a moment -- should we expect refinements in that strategy going forward?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think I acknowledged to Margaret that that\xe2\x80\x99s something that happens -- that there is a high-profile example of that exactly happening once our diplomatic overtures to Turkey resulted in a greater commitment on the part of the Turks to this counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0There was more intense focus on that area along the Syria-Turkey border. \xc2\xa0And there is important progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build on in that region of Syria where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anti-ISIL forces push ISIL out of those areas. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working with the Turks to try to build on that momentum.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s an example of our strategy being refined to reflect both the position of other members of our counter-ISIL campaign, but also to reflect the conditions on the ground inside of Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike, you had a question earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, I wanted to follow up on the wildfires issue. \xc2\xa0You mentioned this change that the administration is seeking that would potentially open up some additional monies for fire suppression efforts. \xc2\xa0There was a letter from Cabinet officials today to the Hill. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s legislation -- bipartisan legislation that would effect that change, and I know some of the co-sponsors are hoping to maybe get it attached to whatever spending vehicle comes through here at the end of the month. \xc2\xa0Is that something the White House would insist upon as well to ensure that the change went through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mike, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of all the details of that specific legislation, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll withhold judgment on it. \xc2\xa0We can look into some of those details for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe case that we have made -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is included in the legislation -- but the case that we have made is that funding to fight wildfires should be similar to the way that funding for other disaster responses are structured. \xc2\xa0And this is essentially to allow there to be regular access to resources to fight wildfires that don\xe2\x80\x99t draw away from those things that -- from those programs that could effectively prevent those wildfires from starting in the first place; that you get into a pretty dangerous downward cycle if you end up cannibalizing all of your wildfire prevention funding to pay for needed wildfire fighting efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as it relates to the legislation, let me look into that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tChris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me just follow up on Byron\xe2\x80\x99s question about the oil exports. \xc2\xa0In stating opposition, you talked about Congressman McCarthy and the oil companies who have (inaudible) charge on this and lobbying very strongly in Congress. \xc2\xa0Having said that, your own Energy Department, the statistical arm of it at least, just put out a report suggesting that not only would this not increase U.S. gas prices, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good possibility it would lower gas prices. \xc2\xa0And I wonder if that very recent survey was part of this calculation? \xc2\xa0And what would you say about, then, the decision that you made given that there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance that this would lower gas prices for Americans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Chris, I guess what I would say is any decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made on this policy is made at the Department of Commerce. \xc2\xa0And so they may have a more specific guidance to offer you in terms of their policy or any planning that they may be engaged in.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy observation is that it seems pretty clear that regardless of the merits of this individual position, that it is quite clear what Leader McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s priorities are -- and they are the priorities of his party in Congress -- is to cozy up to oil interests and to pursue policies and to make policy announcements that are clearly in their interests at venues where he can be sure that they see it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration believes that the American people are better served by making sure that we pursue the kind of approach that also invests in renewable energy that will be good for the long-term benefits of our economy, creating jobs -- particularly in the renewable industry -- while at the same time making decisions that are consistent with the public health and well-being of our communities and children.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I can also follow up on the question of whether or not it seems -- your indication is that the President is considering -- or his staff is considering trying to set up a meeting with Vladimir Putin when he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if a main factor in that is Syria, and if he meets with Putin, is that a reflection of the level of urgency and concern about the military movements in Syria by Russia. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite candid about the fact that we are concerned by any strategic decision by Russia to double down on its support for the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is that the motive -- would that be the main motivating factor in deciding to have this meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, if a meeting is scheduled, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to describe to you why the meeting occurred and even maybe give you a sense of what the conversation was like after it\xe2\x80\x99s occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just a quick follow-up on the refugees, because last week the U.N. and the folks who were on the background call talked about the larger plan that should be in place by October 1st coming -- potentially in the coming days. \xc2\xa0Do you expect that this week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Tell me which plan you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you announced that 10,000 that was the new number that the President suggested, but there was a larger plan about funding -- for example, versus the $4 billion that happened this year. \xc2\xa0Any changes that there might be in terms of process and that kind of thing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you suggested, as did people on the background call, that that plan should be coming in the coming days. \xc2\xa0And I just wondered if you had any update on when that might happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The national security officials who are considering this policy and considering a range of options for scaling up our response to the refugee situation in Europe continue to work urgently on this policy matter, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of the timing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0The Guardian in the UK this morning was quoting Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish President and international (inaudible) as saying that the Russians, in February of 2012, put forward a proposal that would have seen Assad step down, and that that was rejected by the U.S. because U.S. intelligence believed that Assad was going to fall soon anyway. \xc2\xa0I wanted to know if that report is accurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Andrew, I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing about that report from you for the first time so let me take your question and see if I can get you a response.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And on a different subject, is the timing of Xi Jinping\xe2\x80\x99s visit in question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of. \xc2\xa0I would acknowledge that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t announced a specific date, but I think you can look for an announcement relatively soon here.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Despite the cyber issue, you just mentioned that we see another example today of U.S.-China cooperation. \xc2\xa0And recently, China\xe2\x80\x99s news wire reports that during President Xi Jinping\xe2\x80\x99s state visit to the United States, he and President Obama will likely exhibit even stronger aspiration and resolution to take on the climate change issue. \xc2\xa0So I know you probably won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about any deliverables before the meeting, but can we expect any new announcement or stronger aspiration this time during President\xe2\x80\x99s overseas visit to the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details about the Chinese President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the United States soon. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that during that visit, the President would -- President Obama would take the opportunity to discuss with President Xi additional opportunities for the United States and China to cooperate when it comes to cutting carbon pollution.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that during President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s historic visit to China last fall, there was a joint commitment that was made by both leaders on the part of both their countries to take a serious step to cutting carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0And ultimately that led to China making the historic commitment to peak or cap their carbon pollution on around 2030. \xc2\xa0And some of the announcements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today from Chinese cities and provinces would actually indicate that that peaking may occur before 2030 because of some of the serious commitments that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from those cities. \xc2\xa0I know that there are at least two cities, Beijing and Guangzhou, that they will peak their pollution -- or their carbon pollution by 2020. \xc2\xa0And that would obviously make a significant contribution to China meeting the goal that President Xi laid out in China last fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to tell you about possible announcements during the next visit, but I am confident that this will be an issue that is will be an issue that is high on the agenda because it is an issue where President Xi and President Obama have been able to work cooperatively together to advance the interests of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly in the best interests of both our countries\xe2\x80\x99 economies. \xc2\xa0I think, most importantly, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our planet and the public health and well-being of the citizens of both of our countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0With the important Paris conference just around the corner, how important is this bilateral meeting to bring the world closer to meet the goal in December?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, China and the United States are two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest emitters of carbon pollution. \xc2\xa0And to see a serious commitment from our two countries should serve as a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. and China are prepared to confront this challenge head on. \xc2\xa0And, again, we do that because it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of our planet, but also because we know it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the citizens of our countries. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the leaders of other countries that are willing to take a hard look at this I think will arrive at a similar conclusion. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen significant commitments from places like Mexico and South Korea. \xc2\xa0And we would welcome additional commitments from other countries to ensure the success of the international effort to cut carbon pollution and to confront the challenge of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks a lot, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:03 P.M.
