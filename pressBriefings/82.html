Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:04 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 I do have some words here at the top before we get to your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor months now, the administration has been warning about the risk posed by the Zika virus, particularly the risk that is posed to pregnant women.\xc2\xa0 In early January, in the midst of a significant snowstorm that many of you may recall, the President convened his top advisors to formulate a proactive response to this epidemic, which has spread across the Americas.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn February, the administration formally submitted a request to Congress for $1.9 billion for activities that scientists and experts say are critically important to combatting Zika.\xc2\xa0 This includes funding for mosquito control, which is particularly important now that the weather is beginning to warm up.\xc2\xa0 It also includes funding for things --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, not today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 At least not today in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the funding also included investments in disease detection and testing, vaccine development, and support for maternal women\'s health.</p>\n<p>\n\tJust last week, the administration convened a summit in Atlanta of top state and local health officials, nonprofit officials, and health care experts.\xc2\xa0 We heard from states that they\'re keenly aware of the threat that the disease poses, and many do not have the money that they need for basic tasks that would prevent the spread of Zika.</p>\n<p>\n\tOver this time, Congress has done nothing.\xc2\xa0 Now, we know that we cannot continue to fund a robust response to this disease without adequate resources, particularly for our partners in state and local government who bear much of the burden of fighting Zika.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo earlier today, as many of you may have seen, the administration announced that we would reprogram about $600 million to bolster the ongoing Zika response.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve consistently said that an available option for the government was to repurpose some existing Ebola funds that would not undermine our fight against that deadly disease.\xc2\xa0 But we also told Congress that just using some of the Ebola funds would be insufficient.\xc2\xa0 And that should be an indication to you that today\'s actions to reprogram $600 million is a temporary fix and not at all a long-term solution.</p>\n<p>\n\tSince the beginning of the year, our concerns about Zika have only increased because of some new things that we\'ve learned about the disease.\xc2\xa0 First, we\'ve learned that sexual transmission of the virus is actually more common than was initially believed.\xc2\xa0 Second, we learned that the impact of the virus on fetal brain development is likely starker and more serious than first understood.\xc2\xa0 Third, in the United States, the geographical range of the mosquito that carries this virus is significantly broader than our initial estimate.\xc2\xa0 And as we learn more about all of these things, we continue to be concerned about the potential impact of this virus on the public health situation inside the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me leave you with a couple of last thoughts.\xc2\xa0 The first is that this is actually a pretty unique scenario.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got advanced warning of a disease.\xc2\xa0 It was difficult to predict in advance that Ebola would wind up in a patient that had presented himself at an American hospital.\xc2\xa0 That was something that few people predicted.</p>\n<p>\n\tEverybody now is predicting months in advance that we\'re going to see more cases of Zika in the United States.\xc2\xa0 That means that we have an opportunity to do something about it in advance.\xc2\xa0 As I stood at this podium and talked to you about the risks that were posed by Ebola, I think many of you legitimately observed why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the government done more to prepare for these kinds of situations.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe do have an opportunity to prepare for the Zika virus, but Congress has completely abdicated their responsibility to follow through on a proposal that the administration put forward based on the advice of scientific experts.\xc2\xa0 So the administration is going to do what we can right now to fight this disease by shifting funds temporarily from the fight against Ebola into the fight against Zika.\xc2\xa0 State and local officials are certainly doing their job right now to try to prepare their communities to fight Zika.\xc2\xa0 Now it\'s time for Congress to do its job for a change.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with all of that, Kathleen, do you want to get us started?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Actually, I\'m going to come back to the topic from yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure you saw that Pfizer and Allergan had cancelled the merger in the wake of the new inversion rules.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if -- I know you said that the regulations weren\'t explicitly targeted at that transaction, but do you have any reaction -- is this is a sign that these tough new rules have already had an impact --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We make it a habit of not commenting on individual transactions.\xc2\xa0 That is true when transactions, or potential transactions are announced.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also true when potential transactions are killed.\xc2\xa0 So in this case, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction to the specific transaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe were clear yesterday that the steps that the Treasury Department was taking was not focused on any one particular transaction, but rather was focused on a loophole that we knew certain corporate interests either had previously taken advantage of or were looking to take advantage of.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s why they took steps to close that loophole.\xc2\xa0 That, of course, does not eliminate the need for Congress to take action with regard to corporate inversions.\xc2\xa0 In order to completely close the corporate inversion loophole, or frankly, the series of loopholes, we need congressional action in the form of legislation to do that definitively.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just on the broader topic of tax evasion, I\'m wondering if you saw Senator Sanders\'s comment about the Panama Papers.\xc2\xa0 He brought up his opposition to the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement, and called it -- that he had warned that it would be a stamp of approval for Panama as a tax shelter.\xc2\xa0 And he had criticized then-Secretary Clinton for supporting the deal, and I guess by implication also the President for signing it.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if you have any reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the simple facts are that the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to tax measures.\xc2\xa0 And one reason for that is that in 2011, under President Obama\'s leadership, the United States and Panama did conclude a Tax Information Exchange Agreement.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of agreements that the United States maintains with other countries to promote tax transparency in creating a major disincentive for U.S. citizens to use a country like Panama, in this case, to circumvent tax laws.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what essentially that means is it means this exchange of information between the United States and Panama gives enforcement authorities here in the United States greater clarity into financial transactions that are taking place in Panama by U.S. citizens or entities.\xc2\xa0 And this is not dissimilar from the kinds of information-sharing agreements that we\'ve signed with about 112 other countries around the world as a result of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\xc2\xa0 This is the FATCA legislation that President Obama signed into law in 2010.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of this has promoted greater transparency in the context of international financial transactions.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important because it will allow the international community and the United States to do things like fight corruption, to crack down on individuals who are trying to use shell corporations to avoid paying their fair share in taxes.\xc2\xa0 It also is a way for us to detect individuals or entities that are trying to circumvent U.S. financial sanctions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this greater transparency is important to our efforts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that President Obama has fought for both in the context of signing FATCA into law, but also in the context of reaching an agreement with Panama, specifically, to do a better job of exchanging information related to these financial transactions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Senator Sanders is off base?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\'t see his entire comments.\xc2\xa0 But the facts are that the U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement doesn\'t apply to tax measures.\xc2\xa0 And the reason that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessary to write into that agreement certain rules governing tax measures is we already had this existing tax information exchange agreement with Panama that promoted important transparency between our two governments when it comes to these kinds of financial transactions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on the trip to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 And I know you\'ve been asked a couple of times this week, but I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping you have a bit more to give us on what we should expect in terms of the remarks about the Supreme Court, the sort of tenor, the general message, and whether or not this is going to be part of an ongoing effort from the White House to keep this issue in the news -- spotlight on this --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, the President does consider confirming Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court a top priority, and this is an important constitutional responsibility that the President has fulfilled in terms of nominating somebody with impeccable legal credentials to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is that even Republicans have described him as a consensus candidate.\xc2\xa0 He is somebody who has more federal judicial experience than any other nominee to the Supreme Court in American history.\xc2\xa0 And throughout that long career on the federal bench, Chief Judge Garland has demonstrated a commitment to interpreting the law, as a judge should, not seeking to advance a political agenda.\xc2\xa0 This is exactly the kind of person who is worthy of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to make the case to Republicans in the United States Senate that they should fulfill their constitutional responsibility, too, to give him a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 Simple as that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will certainly make that case tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to make that case until the Senate finally starts to do its job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect that Judge Garland will make that case in some form or another down the road?\xc2\xa0 Will he start speaking for himself?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Kathleen, hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to do that in the context of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Outside the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen that\'s how the process is supposed to work.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not at all standing up here suggesting that members of the United States Senate -- Democrat or Republican -- should just vote to confirm Chief Judge Garland because the President said to do it.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we\'re suggesting that they should find out for themselves.\xc2\xa0 And we have been pleased to see that there are a number of members of the Senate that have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland in private.\xc2\xa0 That is traditionally how this process has worked, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working to set up additional meetings with Republicans to have those private conversations in the days and weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that Chairman Grassley has even indicated that next week he\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to meet with Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s all good news.\xc2\xa0 But I guess the thing -- the point that I would make is, why does it have to all take place in private?\xc2\xa0 Why not have Chief Judge Garland go out in public, under oath, on camera and answer tough questions from individual members of the United States Senate, Democrats and Republicans?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s traditionally the way the process has worked.\xc2\xa0 And our expectation is that that\xe2\x80\x99s the way the process should work this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI suspect the reason that Republicans are resisting the process is because they too believe that Chief Judge Garland on camera, under oath, facing tough questions would demonstrate for everybody that he actually is worthy of a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, Republicans are in a position where they\xe2\x80\x99re making complaints about this process not based on Chief Judge Garland or his credentials or his record or how he would serve the American people on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you hear Republicans actually saying that this has way more to do with their political objections to the President of the United States, to President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou heard from Senator Cornyn that he had taken a vow not to confirm another Obama judge to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 You heard Ron Johnson a few weeks ago acknowledge that if a Republican were President, that the Republicans in the Senate would be treating the nominee quite a bit differently than they are now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans who have politicized this process.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the other reason it\xe2\x80\x99s a little ironic that yesterday, you heard the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley do something that is pretty remarkable -- in a town and in a context like this where we\xe2\x80\x99re used to charges and counter-charges, and disputes across the aisle being traded back and forth -- and at least when it comes to Republicans, sometimes there are charges within the party that are being traded back and forth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think we need to create a whole separate category when you have the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman go to the floor of the United States Senate and criticize the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and accuse him of politicizing the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty remarkable turn of events.\xc2\xa0 It certainly flies in the face of Chairman Grassley\xe2\x80\x99s well-established reputation for being a straight shooter who\xe2\x80\x99s focused on just getting the job done for the people of Iowa.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think the other thing is it\xe2\x80\x99s also remarkably ironic.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s Chairman Grassley who is the person who is standing in the way of this process moving forward, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Chairman Grassley who is suggesting that it\xe2\x80\x99s the President -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s a presidential election year, and therefore he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to do his job, to then turn around and say that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually the fault of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court that the process has gotten so politicized.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a curious explanation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tTim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Zika, why do you think the White House hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to convince Congress to push through the funding?\xc2\xa0 And is the President -- or has he made calls to lawmakers on Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential calls to tell you about, but there have been a number of conversations with senior White House officials and senior administration officials about this legislation being a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that this should be a partisan dispute.\xc2\xa0 Ron, yesterday, asked me about a range of opportunities where Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together to get something done in Congress, and I went through a lengthy list, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include Zika funding.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that Democrats and Republicans should disagree about the need to protect the American people from an impending epidemic that has serious consequences for pregnant women in this country.\xc2\xa0 That surely should be something that we could figure out a way to agree on and actually take the responsible steps that are necessary to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, Tim, here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing about this -- and in some ways, this is a little bit of human nature, and a little bit of this is some of the imperfection of our political system.\xc2\xa0 But responsible adults should be able to step back and acknowledge that planning in advance, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something like this, is really important.\xc2\xa0 Mark my words, at some point -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be -- at some point later this spring, maybe later this summer, all of you and your news organizations are going to be sounding the alarm about the significant threat that is posed by the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 That is going to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe know that as the weather warms up, as the mosquito population spreads, that this is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to deal with.\xc2\xa0 And I regret, the President regrets that Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t fulfilled their responsibilities to take these steps to fight something that we know is coming.\xc2\xa0 But I hope that all of you as you\xe2\x80\x99re writing those stories remember this day.\xc2\xa0 Because the administration is fighting hard to get Congress just to fulfill their basic function and allow the federal government and our experts and state and local officials to take the steps that we know should be taken to begin to implement mosquito-control programs and try and kill mosquitoes; to start to expand our lab capacity so that we can track the virus; to start to develop better diagnostics and vaccines; and to do the other kinds of things that would allow us to put in place effective prevention tools; and where necessary, begin to stockpile necessary resources to respond to this disease.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House see lawmakers it can work with in states that might see Zika first like Florida, Texas?\xc2\xa0 Does it see Republicans it can work with there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, we\'re going to work with anybody who is ready to work with us.\xc2\xa0 Some of the data indicates that there are a bunch of northern states that may be fortunate enough to avoid seeing this particular mosquito that carries the virus migrating to their states.\xc2\xa0 But even those senators should understand how important this is.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re willing to work with anybody -- Democrat or Republican -- to try to move this forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut you\'re right, most of the pressure should be on senators from states like Texas and Mississippi and Alabama and Florida and Georgia -- places where we know the climate is warmer, where the mosquito populations of this particular mosquito are likely to be larger.\xc2\xa0 And, yes, there is something that all those states have in common, that they\'re overwhelmingly represented by Republicans in the United States Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I guess at some point they\'re going to have to choose whether or not their animosity toward President Obama trumps their desire to try to protect pregnant women in their states from this terrible disease.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Pfizer and tax inversions, how would you describe the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 I know you don\'t want to comment on particular deals.\xc2\xa0 But does he seem happy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think my reluctance to comment on individual deals also includes my reluctance to comment on the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to individual deals.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unhappy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So, but it was a good try, though, Tim.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 JC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This seems like something that the President might want to bring in the governors, and we talked earlier about governors -- the Zika crisis basically.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m understanding that the travel and tourism business in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is suffering as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 This last season was not what they hoped.\xc2\xa0 Might the President go to the administrator of the Small Business Administration and discuss a possible support or aid for some of the small businesses that exist in those areas that are being affected by the perception, at least, of the Zika virus and how that effect is affecting the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any presidential conversations that have involved that topic, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident there is somebody at the Small Business Administration who could give you a sense of what kind of resources or assistance could be provided by the federal government if that situation arises or even gets worse.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you, though, that there already has been extensive coordination between administration officials and state and local officials.\xc2\xa0 So I made a reference to last Friday in Atlanta, at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control, there was a summit that was convened with administration officials and with the top state and local health officials from across the country to discuss what our response to this should be.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, this is a pretty unique scenario.\xc2\xa0 We have an opportunity to get out ahead of this disease.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think we\'re going to -- the sense is not that we can prevent it entirely, but we can begin to take steps right now before the disease is widespread in the United States that can prevent it from having the worst possible impact on our public health.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd because of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to act, our ability to take those steps is quite limited right now -- so limited, in fact, that we are now actually having to take money away from the Ebola fight to try to at least begin some of those activities to prepare for the onset of the mosquito season and the potential spread of the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 But those resources are insufficient.\xc2\xa0 We need a lot more resources to make sure we\'re doing everything we possibly can to protect pregnant women in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 That shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a controversial notion.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a common-sense one.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s going to seem pretty common sense if and when we reach the scenario where there is genuine public panic about the spread of this disease.\xc2\xa0 And again, I take no joy in suggesting that Republicans are going to look back on this time that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to act on the Zika virus and deeply regret it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s deeply regrettable right now that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t taking the necessary steps to fight this disease.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just sort of wanted to ask about -- when you talk about these limited funds, but you do have $600 million to take from Ebola, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t as pressing at the moment, in what ways is the lack of funding felt?\xc2\xa0 So what is not being done that could be done with more money?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about a couple of those things.\xc2\xa0 The first is it is typically local jurisdictions that are responsible for fighting mosquitoes.\xc2\xa0 In some states I know that they\xe2\x80\x99ve even set up mosquito-control districts where they can essentially tax local residents to reduce the mosquito population in those communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe sense here is knowing that this is a disease that is carried by mosquitoes that we should ramp up and expand mosquito-control efforts in communities across the country, particularly in those communities in the south where there already is a large mosquito population, and one that is only going to grow as the calendar gets closer to the summertime.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is that there is a lot of scientific work that needs to be done to develop diagnostics and vaccines.\xc2\xa0 A lot of that work is done by the private sector, but they do so based on guarantees from the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And in order to get a serious investment on the part of the private sector, the federal government needs to be able to make some commitments about a market existing for these products.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s why we believe that longer-term funding is critically important to make available right now so the private sector has the confidence that they can go out and invest in robust production of diagnostic tools and vaccines to fight Zika.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is additional work that can be done primarily by state and local health authorities to try to prepare for the eventuality that Zika arrives in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And many of those preparatory activities are limited until they get sufficient funding.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last thing is just laboratory capacity.\xc2\xa0 If you have a situation where a whole bunch of people are going to start getting tested to see whether or not they have the Zika virus, we need to make sure that we can then process those tests rapidly enough to give people a quick response so that they can begin to take the necessary precautions if they are determined to have the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHere\xe2\x80\x99s why that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xc2\xa0 Four out of five people that contract Zika won\xe2\x80\x99t have any symptoms.\xc2\xa0 And it could potentially put individuals in a situation where they unknowingly pass the disease on to their sexual partners, for example.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why providing them information about whether or not they have the Zika virus is critical, and ensuring that diagnostics can be promptly processed through the labs requires additional lab capacity.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that we would use funding from Congress to do.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that at this point, the federal government can\xe2\x80\x99t do all that it wants to do to try to prevent Zika because of the money?\xc2\xa0 Or is the money that you\xe2\x80\x99re transferring over adequate for X amount of time, and how much time would that be?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that right now the federal government needs additional resources to make sure that the federal government and state and local governments are doing all that is necessary to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is why we need Congress to step up to the plate and not do something controversial, not do something that guarantees anybody a political victory, but to do something that would make the American people safer from a virus that targets pregnant women and their newborn babies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- you\xe2\x80\x99re transferring a large amount of money.\xc2\xa0 Is that allowing the federal government to do everything it wants to do for a particular amount of time?\xc2\xa0 And can you tell me what that time is?\xc2\xa0 Or is the federal government right now not able to do everything it wants to do because the $600 million that you\xe2\x80\x99re transferring is not enough?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that the $600 million is not enough, and that there is more support that we would provide in particular to state and local authorities who are carrying a lot of this burden.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s state and local authorities that are going to be responsible for mosquito control.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s state and local authorities that need to ramp up their public health infrastructure to make sure that if individuals show up sick to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office, that a Zika diagnosis can be quickly made if necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s accurate to say that the federal government would be doing more if it had more money from Congress right now.\xc2\xa0 I just want to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And we believe there is more that the federal, state and local governments should be doing with sufficient resources to protect the American people from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 And right now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening because Congress has not done its job.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, great.\xc2\xa0 And on Pfizer, I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on the individual cases, but you spoke very generally about what these rules want to do.\xc2\xa0 So any time you have a company that would have completed a merger that would have resulted in a tax inversion that is now prevented, you would call that a success, right?\xc2\xa0 Is that exactly what these rules intend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The intent of the rule is to close a loophole that allows individual corporations to, on paper, move their company\xe2\x80\x99s operations overseas so that they can avoid paying taxes.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the President thinks that that\xe2\x80\x99s unfair.\xc2\xa0 This is a tax benefit that is not available to middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s only available to wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals.\xc2\xa0 And the lost revenue associated with individuals not -- or corporations in this case -- not paying their fair share does have an impact on our ability to invest in our schools, or in reducing the cost of a college education, or in putting people back to work building our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the loss.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on closing that loophole.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll let individual companies discuss how exactly they\xe2\x80\x99re affected by the closing of this loophole.\xc2\xa0 But, yes, preventing anybody, any corporation from using this loophole to avoid paying taxes is exactly the intent of the rule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what would you say about the results of the primary last night?\xc2\xa0 Kind of an --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not much, probably.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- interesting --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that\xe2\x80\x99s been said, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\xe2\x80\x99d have a whole lot to weigh in on it.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, Wisconsin is going to be an important state in the general election.\xc2\xa0 And at some point, regardless of who the nominees are, there will be a vigorous campaign in the fall in that state.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it is -- I think those who did well in the results -- or who did well in the election yesterday want to say that Wisconsin had an important role to play in the primary.\xc2\xa0 I think what is clear is that Wisconsin, regardless of who the nominees are, will have an important role to play in the general.\xc2\xa0 And so there will be more to come from Wisconsin voters, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, before the year is up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from the Clinton campaign is that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be sort of changing their tack from here on out, that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be more of trying to disqualify -- is the word that we\'ve heard from some advisors -- Bernie Sanders.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve already heard this kind of abrasive rhetoric from Republicans against each other.\xc2\xa0 Now things might get more testy among the Democrats.\xc2\xa0 What are your thoughts on that?\xc2\xa0 And given the President\'s words on -- we heard him at I think it was a fundraiser, I think about a month ago, where he talked sort of behind the scenes and off camera about trying to unify the party.\xc2\xa0 What do you think if the Democratic race is also going to be getting more contentious, I guess would be the word?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it is fair to say that Democrats have a long way to go -- a long way to go -- before they reach the level of vitriol that has been traded between the Republican candidates, to say nothing of the comments that Republican candidates have made about each other\'s spouses.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think what is true is the President, at some point, as the leader of the Democratic Party, as the most well-regarded figure not just in the Democratic Party, but right now in American politics, the President is going to play an important role in the general election -- first and foremost, unifying Democrats behind the Democratic nominee, but also making a strong case about his successor.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve all heard from the President about the kind of argument that he wants to make about ensuring that he\'s succeeded by somebody who shares his values and is committed to building on the progress that we\'ve made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, there will be plenty of time for that general election to come around and for the President to spend a lot of time in public making a forceful case in support of his successor.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is more contentiousness now at this point, though, going to lessen the unity that many see as ultimately necessary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think people expect that a Democratic primary -- or a primary on either side is going to be vigorous.\xc2\xa0 I think the question is, are you focused on the issues that are most important to the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I think to the extent that you have seen a debate on the Republican side, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily been focused on those issues.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s been focused on a lot of other things.\xc2\xa0 But on the Democratic side, to the extent that there have been differences between the candidates on policy, it has been focused on issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a healthy thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, is the President getting at all antsy sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the nominee to come with the -- clinch delegates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President has plenty on his plate right now.\xc2\xa0 But the time will come where the President will have the opportunity to make a forceful public case about who he believes should succeed him in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And when that time comes, I\'m confident that the President will join that debate with a lot of zest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, I wanted to ask you about the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The President put out statements earlier this week praising the governors of California and New York for their action raising the state minimum wage there to $15.00 an hour.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the budget that the President put forward had a dollar amount, but congressional Democrats have consistently talked about this $10.10 figure.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President coming down on this right now?\xc2\xa0 Where does he want to see the federal minimum wage go to?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has been pretty clear that he\'s strongly supportive of Democratic efforts in the United States Congress to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a couple of different proposals out there, and the President has simply said that it\'s time to give hardworking Americans a raise.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s unfortunate that Republicans have thus far blocked that idea and blocked that legislation from moving forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\'s thinking is actually pretty simple here -- that our economy grows best when it grows from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And if we\'re looking for ways -- and this is what Republicans say -- to give people an incentive to go back to work, what better way to give them an incentive to work hard than to give them a raise?\xc2\xa0 Right now, we\'re not properly incentivizing or rewarding hard work.\xc2\xa0 Right now, if you\'re raising a family of four and you\'re working full-time, but only getting paid the minimum wage, you\'re trying to raise your family below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that that\'s fair.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not good for our economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President is a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a variety of proposals that have been floated in states, and there are a handful of proposals that have been floated in Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the people who are making minimum wage in America right now deserve a raise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post had an op-ed that said that $15.00 an hour would represent a quantum leap in the increase in the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House disagree with that?\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that making that large of a jump from $7.25 all the way up to $15.00, or even if it\'s $12.00, is that something that\'s happening too quick, too fast?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think many of the proposals that have been floated in Congress have been phased proposals.\xc2\xa0 And I think that even many of these -- I\'m not familiar with all the ins and outs of municipalities and states that have raised their minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I know many of them have a phased increase in the minimum wage, and I think for common-sense reasons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, right now you have Republicans who are saying that people who are working the minimum wage don\'t deserve a raise.\xc2\xa0 People who are working full-time, making the minimum wage, raising a family of four, deserve to be below the poverty line.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand why that\'s the case that they\'re making.\xc2\xa0 It certainly seems inconsistent not just with common sense, or a common-sense appraisal of or economy, it also seems inconsistent with the kind of rhetoric that we hear from Republicans about having access to the American Dream.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re going to continue to make our case to Republicans, but this is another example where Republicans in Congress have sided with corporate interests rather than hardworking Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Toluse.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier on inversions that you\'ll allow individual companies to talk about this on their own.\xc2\xa0 And I wanted to give you a chance to respond to what the Allergan CEO said in an interview earlier today.\xc2\xa0 He said that these new rules are un-American and they seem to have been written in a way that specifically targets this deal and no others.\xc2\xa0 And he also said that these new deals will build a wall around the U.S., that there will be less foreign investment in the future.\xc2\xa0 So I wanted to give you a chance to respond.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the last part, just as a factual matter, he\'s wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department can walk you through the technical details, but there are provisions that are included in the rules that allow for significant investments on the part of foreign countries -- or foreign companies to make investments in the United States.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s obviously a good thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about how that\'s important for our economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been a leading advocate of companies overseas doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is going to spend some time in Germany at the end of this month, where you\'ll hear more from him talking about how important it is for companies around the world to invest in the United States, that they can get access to a vibrant economy.\xc2\xa0 They can get access to the hardest-working, most innovative workers in the world.\xc2\xa0 They can get access to a business climate where people who work hard and play by the rules have a pretty good shot at success.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is entirely consistent with the case that we\'ve been making for some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the other aspects of the quote, look, I think it is difficult to have a lot of patience for an American CEO trying to execute a complicated financial transaction to avoid paying taxes in America talking about what it means to be a good citizen of the United States.\xc2\xa0 At this point, it\'s hard to have a lot of patience for the commentary on patriotism from a corporate leader who\'s prepared to renounce his citizenship just to avoid paying his fair share.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s I think part of why I think the American people are strongly on the side of the government in this case.\xc2\xa0 You have some corporate leaders -- look, I think most corporate leaders are trying to do the right thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 Most corporate leaders in America understand that a strong American economy is good for their business.\xc2\xa0 And the concern that we have is with the leaders of some corporations that are looking to take the best of America without making a contribution to the success of our country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to have a lot of patience -- or I don\'t think anybody else is going to have a lot of patience for a discussion of patriotism from somebody who is advocating that kind of approach to their company\xe2\x80\x99s accounting practices.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that since this was done via executive action instead of going through Congress, and since it was such a major rule change, that it\xe2\x80\x99s sunken this $160 billion deal that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that there may be unintended consequences since Congress wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in terms of how this might affect future deals, future decisions by companies in terms of investing in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Treasury Department because I think that they have been quite thoughtful about this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, many of you observed yesterday that it took the Treasury Department a couple of years to announce these rule changes, so they clearly have thought through the consequences for this specific action.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also why there are specific provisions in here that go to great lengths to ensure that we\'re not overly disincentivizing foreign companies who are seeking to invest in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur target here, what we\'re focused on is American companies that are seeking to move overseas only on paper just to avoid paying American taxes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the loophole that we\'re focused on closing.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that these rules will be helpful in pursuing that goal.\xc2\xa0 But to definitively end this unpatriotic corporate practice, we need Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 And more precisely we need Republicans in Congress to stop working so hard to defend corporate interests that are seeking to shirk their basic American responsibility.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the real issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not Democrats -- at least that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of -- that are opposed to closing the inversion loophole.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there are a handful of Republicans who are supportive of it, including at least one presidential candidate.\xc2\xa0 But yet we can\'t get Republicans in Congress to understand the significance of their failure to act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on -- apparently WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, decided to encrypt all messages that are sent over that messaging service going forward.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering since there has been such a big debate over Apple and the FBI and terrorism, if you have a reaction to that decision by WhatsApp?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\'t change our policy or our view of how the federal government and the technology industry can and should be able to work together to ensure that robust -- or that strong encryption can be robustly deployed without giving terrorists or child pornographers or other bad actors a safe haven in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated and it\xe2\x80\x99s technical, in part because these policies and the technology itself is rapidly changing.\xc2\xa0 It means that we need to have a policy that can adapt along with it.\xc2\xa0 That kind of innovation is healthy.\xc2\xa0 We also want to make sure that we don\'t put in place rules that are going to stifle that innovation.\xc2\xa0 That innovation is critical to the success of our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also critical to the success of strong encryption.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are areas where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to work together to get this done, including fighting things like child pornography.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully when it comes to keeping the American people safe from terrorism, we should be able to work together to stop that, too.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one clarification on the Zika thing.\xc2\xa0 My colleagues who have covered this a lot closer over the last couple of months say that when Republicans have repeatedly asked on Capitol Hill of the administration, why don\'t you just spend some of the Ebola money that you have, the answer from the administration for the last two months has been, it\xe2\x80\x99s spent.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t have it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s allocated.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no way we can spend any of that money.\xc2\xa0 So I guess the question is:\xc2\xa0 What changed between -- what changed now that changed that answer and suddenly you have half a billion dollars to spend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not been our approach.\xc2\xa0 And since we started talking about this in early February, even when I discussed this shortly after the President talked about this in the Super Bowl interview he did with CBS, we acknowledged that there were some funds that could be made available to this fight from Ebola-dedicated accounts that we could take away without completely undermining the fight against Ebola.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you didn\'t do it for two months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was that just a -- that was a political decision to keep the pressure on for two months, and then now it\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough that you want to go ahead and take the money?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, now we can\'t wait any longer for Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 We simply asked Congress for the money, and they didn\'t act.\xc2\xa0 And so now we\'re going to take -- we\'re doing the responsible thing, which is drawing on all available resources to try to meet this urgent need.\xc2\xa0 But the only reason that we\'re having to do that, to tap in an emergency fashion these funds is because Congress for two months hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done a single thing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you didn\'t tell them for the last two months that this money was not available to spend?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t account for all the conversations.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said publicly since the first Monday in February is that there would be some funding that we could use to this effort from Ebola, but that that funding level would be insufficient to meet the significant needs that we\xe2\x80\x99ve identified, and that there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk associated with drawing that money away from the Ebola fight.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we\'re going to continue to urge Congress that as they pass the Zika money, that they also make sure that they\'re making available funds so that we can repay the Ebola accounts that have been drawn down to deal with this emergency situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe truth is this is way more complicated than it should be.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we knew back in February that this was going to be a significant issue.\xc2\xa0 We put forward a specific plan to Congress about what resources would be necessary.\xc2\xa0 And for two months Congress hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done a thing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t really understand how they account for that.\xc2\xa0 Maybe they want to suggest that there has been some sort of miscommunication.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that kind of explanation is going to fly when it comes to the American people wondering why their government didn\'t take all of the available steps that they knew were necessary to try to protect pregnant women and their newborn kids from the Zika virus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration is going to have a strong case to make about what we\'ve been doing.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been focused on this since January.\xc2\xa0 We put forward a specific plan to Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been interacting with state and local officials trying to provide them advice and support about what steps they can take to fight the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 The President had a conversation with the governors when they were here back in February about steps they could take in their own states.\xc2\xa0 We convened this conference at the CDC at the end of last week.\xc2\xa0 We\'re taking money that is available from some Ebola accounts to try to shore up this investment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut all of this activity has taken place on the part of the administration and on the part of state and local officials, to be fair.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to Congress, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten nothing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on the Zika thing, I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by the way you\xe2\x80\x99re describing the circumstance that we find ourselves in.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about it in the same sentence with the words Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Yes, pregnant women and their newborns are the target, but it seemed to me that months ago you were trying to downplay how much of a threat to public health Zika was.\xc2\xa0 You were saying how the symptoms were mild in many cases, and how it\xe2\x80\x99s not fatal, it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like Ebola, and now it sounds like your tone has changed a lot.\xc2\xa0 And the question is, has this all become just too partisan?\xc2\xa0 You list this funding issue -- which is a legitimate issue -- along with six or seven other things that Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t act on, as we were discussing yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So how much of a threat and how serious is this whole outbreak to the general population?\xc2\xa0 And are you being a bit partisan about this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ron, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to make clear that there is no reason this should be partisan.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think I just went to great lengths to actually point out that the danger is most significant for states that are represented in the Congress by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 But yet, the administration has made this a priority.\xc2\xa0 The administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care any less about people who are represented in Congress by Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re genuinely concerned about the health of the American people.\xc2\xa0 In this case, we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about pregnant women and their newborn babies who are at the greatest risk from the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI have gone to great lengths to try to describe to people exactly what the risk is that is posed by the Zika virus.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s different than the risk that is posed by Ebola.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to great lengths to make that clear.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the risk is insignificant.\xc2\xa0 The risk is quite significant when you talk about the impact that this virus has on pregnant women and their newborn babies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd our concern has been enhanced by the fact that we now know that sexual transmission of this virus is actually more common than was previously thought.\xc2\xa0 That is a reason for us to raise awareness among people who are not pregnant women about the risk that they could pose, and about the risk that the Zika virus could pose to them and their family.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of all the diseases and maladies that the public health system is fighting, why is just the Ebola account that Zika money can be drawn from?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a technical reason, but it just strikes me as odd that suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Zika and Ebola in the same sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think in this case, there -- well --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because they\xe2\x80\x99re nothing alike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is an illustrative thing.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what they do have in common.\xc2\xa0 They both are reliant, at least in part, on a high-functioning public health care system to protect people.\xc2\xa0 And we saw in the Ebola situation that our public health system in the United States didn\xe2\x80\x99t perform quite as well as we\xe2\x80\x99d expected.\xc2\xa0 We certainly saw that the way that a poor public health system in another country had a very real impact on the public health of the United States; that the reason that the Ebola virus got so out of control in West Africa is because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have nearly the public health infrastructure in place to protect it.\xc2\xa0 And in order to eventually go fight that disease, the United States military had to take it upon themselves to begin laying the ground work for the international community to come in and essentially build that public health infrastructure from the ground up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are significant resources that were dedicated after the fact by Congress to fighting Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And so this is the second thing that they have in common.\xc2\xa0 Ebola didn\xe2\x80\x99t get people\xe2\x80\x99s attention until -- at least significantly in the United States, it certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of attention in Congress until somebody showed up at an American hospital with symptoms of the Ebola virus.\xc2\xa0 That was a wake-up call for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we did see Congress eventually mobilize to stop it.\xc2\xa0 But many of you -- or mobilize to get us the resources to stop it.\xc2\xa0 Many of you I think legitimately asked, well, why did it take so long, and why did it take an incident -- somebody testing positive for Ebola in the United States for Congress to take any sort of action, or for the government to take any sort of action, to begin to prepare the American people?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the opportunity that we have right now.\xc2\xa0 We do know what\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xc2\xa0 We do know that this mosquito-borne virus is more prevalent and is likely to be more prevalent in the United States as the weather warms up.\xc2\xa0 And we know that it poses significant risk to pregnant women and newborn children.\xc2\xa0 That is why we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get out ahead of this.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to learn the lessons from Ebola.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re two different diseases -- both caused by a virus, both have different risks -- but the thing that we know is that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be more effective in fighting Zika if we can start trying to prevent it in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the military.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the President had these meetings with his defense team and so on and so forth about ISIS.\xc2\xa0 And he said in his remarks something about how we can no longer tolerate ISIL having a headquarters in Raqqa -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting pretty closely.\xc2\xa0 So is something going to be different now?\xc2\xa0 Is there some new strategy if, in fact, we can\xe2\x80\x99t tolerate this existing headquarters there anymore?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was making the case that we continue to be very focused in trying to enhance the fighting capacity of local fighters on the ground in Syria who are focused on fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And there have been ample public discussions about the fact that the next big objective for that fighting force is to start moving toward Raqqa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd they\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important progress.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve severed the supply line between Raqqa and Mosul.\xc2\xa0 There are some communities, including Shaddadi, on the outskirts of Raqqa, or at least in the same region as Raqqa, where they\xe2\x80\x99ve made important progress and kicked ISIL out of that town.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\xe2\x80\x99re slowly encroaching on ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s capital.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President is making clear why that objective is a priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The analysis was that Raqqa would be a target many months from now, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t imminent.\xc2\xa0 And maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong -- how would you characterize how imminent it is or not?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly do not have any military training, but it is unwise to announce military operations before they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that there are many, many military airstrikes that have been carried out by the United States and our coalition partners against ISIL targets in Raqqa.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there already is significant pressure that\xe2\x80\x99s being applied against ISIL targets in Raqqa.\xc2\xa0 There already are ISIL officials in Raqqa that have been killed by U.S. military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 There are other aspects of ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure in Raqqa, including financial resources, that have been destroyed by U.S. military airstrikes in Raqqa.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re already applying significant pressure against ISIL officials in their capital.\xc2\xa0 But our broader objective is to enhance the capacity of local fighters on the ground to eventually drive ISIL out of that city.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated timeframe for you on that, but that is certainly an important priority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that was a not routine meeting, but it was a regular meeting that he has, and so forth.\xc2\xa0 And even though the strategy was assessed, as it is on an ongoing basis -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to use some -- we should expect that that moment was not pivotal?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing dramatically different that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be happening on the ground in that theater now, going forward, post-Brussels?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I totally understand your question.\xc2\xa0 The President typically meets with combatant commanders who are military uniform leaders from around the world every year or two.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll host all of them when they happen to be in town, invite them over to the White House.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll do a business meeting, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a formal dinner.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously, ISIL was a prominent topic of discussion, but far from the only one.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of challenges that the United States military is confronting around the globe, and those are the kinds of challenges that were discussed in the meeting, including making sure that our military leaders have the resources that are necessary to wage those fights.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes all of that is important.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to steadily ramp up the pressure against ISIL not just in Syria, but also in Iraq, and anyplace else that extremists decide that they want to try to establish a safe haven and carry out strikes against the United States.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen recent strikes in places like Somalia and Yemen and even Libya against extremists that are threatening the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is something that the President has described as his top priority.\xc2\xa0 That was true before Brussels and it continues to be true today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to ask -- two different subjects.\xc2\xa0 On the Zika virus, as you\xe2\x80\x99re offering these warnings about the summer, what\xe2\x80\x99s the worst-case scenario that you\xe2\x80\x99ve envisioning for the summer?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific projections to offer from here.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we have seen is that we do anticipate that the mosquito that carries this virus, or is capable of carrying this virus, is likely to be more widespread in the United States than previously thought.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPart of our concern about the Zika virus is also motivated by additional information that indicates that the Zika virus is more easily spread through sexual contact than was previously understood.\xc2\xa0 We also are concerned that the Zika virus appears to have a more potent impact on infant brain development than was previously understood.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of reasons to be more concerned about this particular situation than we were early in the year.\xc2\xa0 But even then, the administration was mindful of the risk that this virus posed, and we sought to communicate publicly to the American people in accurate form exactly what the risk was.\xc2\xa0 But we also conveyed to Congress specifically exactly what we believed was necessary to try to fight this virus, and what steps we could take in advance of the mosquito season, if you will, to fight this disease, or to at least prepare for its arrival and spread in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re more ramped up now than you were about a month or two ago when you had the officials at the podium talking about the virus.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We have made some steps to try to ramp up our preparations.\xc2\xa0 A lot of this has involved coordinating with state and local officials who, again, are going to bear the burden of this response.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for fighting mosquito populations.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re going to be responsible for the strength and effectiveness of their public health infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAll these are things that take place at the state and local level.\xc2\xa0 And the United States government has an important responsibility to give them the resources that they need to carry out these activities.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is the other reason that Congress should be taking these requests seriously, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United States -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the President of the United States that\xe2\x80\x99s making this request.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s making this request on behalf of state and local officials who are desperate to ensure that they have the resources necessary to protect their citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So since you\xe2\x80\x99re ramping everything up, what\xe2\x80\x99s the status of the vaccines?\xc2\xa0 I remember the conversation the last time the vaccines were coming, but there were trials that were -- are you ramping that up?\xc2\xa0 Well, not are you, but is there a ramp-up in that as well?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the status?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that that work has been continuing, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure my colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control could give you an update.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the last subject, is there hope that Merrick Garland will have some sort of hearing -- a Senate confirmation hearing before the end of this administration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 Just yesterday, a Republican senator, after having met with Chief Judge Garland, joined the call suggesting that the next step should be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that next week, Judge Garland will be meeting with a number of Republican senators -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the list right here somewhere -- that includes, just next week, Senators Ayotte, Portman, Murkowski and Flake will be meeting with Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 Chief Judge Garland will be meeting next week with the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley from Iowa.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, there is a continued progress that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear -- or at least, I should say, the Senate Judiciary Committee has made clear that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to accept the questionnaire from Chief Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a process that, slowly but surely, is moving forward.\xc2\xa0 But we need to see Republicans demonstrate a clear commitment to actually doing their job and fulfilling their constitutional responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And the idea that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do their job just because Mitch McConnell told them not to is not an explanation that\xe2\x80\x99s going to fly with their voters.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the constituents in some of these states are saying -- in the Republican states are saying no; Democratic states are saying yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you have a clear divide.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I disagree.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide you some publicly available polling information that are conducted by the new organizations of your colleagues that actually send a rather clear signal, even in purple states like the one that is represented in the United States Senate by Chairman Grassley, that most Republicans agree with us.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMost Republican voters agree that members of the United States Senate should do their job, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s a presidential election year and even though Mitch McConnell doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want them to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get your private polling -- not the public one.\xc2\xa0 Can you get that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Gregory.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to Pfizer but take it maybe in a slightly different direction.\xc2\xa0 We also had news today out of the Justice Department on the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger.\xc2\xa0 There is a Staples-Office Depot merger that is being challenged at the Federal Trade Commission.\xc2\xa0 Can you connect the dots for us on this a little bit, not just on tax policy, but anti-trust policy, consumer protection policy, financial regulation?\xc2\xa0 Could you articulate what the President\xe2\x80\x99s attitude is towards these corporate mergers?\xc2\xa0 Do they add value to the economy and to shareholders through creating more efficiencies?\xc2\xa0 Or is it fair to say he\xe2\x80\x99s more skeptical because of the impacts these mergers often have on taxpayers and on jobs and on consumers?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard for me to be helpful in answering this question because we\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to weigh in on individual financial transactions.\xc2\xa0 And some of the transactions that you referred to are actually being considered by independent regulators, like at the FTC or at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do is try to ask this at a level that you can comment on.\xc2\xa0 Philosophically, how does the President, how does this administration view corporate mergers?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think philosophically you have to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what regulators do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the President\xe2\x80\x99s principle here is that the United States economy is the envy of the world.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 But one of the reasons that we have recovered so strongly from the economic downturn in 2007 and 2008 is the President was focused on a strategy that was growing the economy from the middle out.\xc2\xa0 And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the best interests of middle-class families, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be doing the right thing, not just for those middle-class families but for the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to all these economic issues.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is such a strong advocate of putting people back to work by building our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Those are pretty good jobs.\xc2\xa0 But those also lay the foundation for the long-term strength of our economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is a strong advocate for things like early childhood education, or lowering the cost of a college education, or even many job-training programs that ensure that American workers have the skills they need to compete in a 21st century global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way that the President sort of evaluates all of these economic circumstances, and certainly the way he evaluates economic policies.\xc2\xa0 I guess it would be fair to say that assessing the impact of those kinds of transactions on middle-class families would be the way the President believes one could reasonably determine their impact on the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on Zika, it seems to be the White House position that Congress is forcing you into a position where you have to rob Peter to pay Paul on Zika.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about what you want to give to Paul.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about Peter and what exactly -- (laughter) -- what Ebola-related activities you will not be able to do because you\xe2\x80\x99ve diverted $510 million from Ebola to Zika?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of granular detail on exactly what sort of impact this will have.\xc2\xa0 I will note that this is not all of the available Ebola money.\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t take our eye off the ball when it comes to Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And so there are critical aspects of the fight against Ebola that are ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, I think the other thing that I should clarify -- and this goes a little bit to Ron\xe2\x80\x99s question from earlier -- is that a lot of our Ebola funding and our efforts to fight Ebola were actually focused on improving public health infrastructures.\xc2\xa0 So these are the kinds -- the shorthand for all of this is Ebola, because we saw that weaknesses in that public health infrastructure contributed to a greater risk of Ebola.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the fact is, enhancing this public health infrastructure, both in the United States and around the world, can have the effect of protecting the American people from a wide variety of diseases.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s all the more reason that we can\xe2\x80\x99t risk undermining those critically important investments simply because Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t take the necessary steps, the common-sense steps to prepare for a disease that we know is on the way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so I will see if we can get somebody at OMB to provide you with some additional information on that.\xc2\xa0 But generally speaking, that\xe2\x80\x99s what our approach has been.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A sad note to begin on.\xc2\xa0 Merle Haggard has passed away on his 79th birthday.\xc2\xa0 The country music world losing a legend.\xc2\xa0 Your thoughts on his passing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s a legend in country music.\xc2\xa0 And his passing I think is something that people all across the country -- even people who are only casual country music fans -- can appreciate.\xc2\xa0 He was a legend.\xc2\xa0 And he was somebody who I think told the kinds of stories that, whether you live in an urban community or a suburban community or a rural community, I think you could relate to.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so obviously his passing is a loss for country music, but it obviously is a loss for all the people who got to know him personally too.\xc2\xa0 And so I say our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks for that, Josh, appreciate that.\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a bit about inversions today.\xc2\xa0 I want to circle back to the fiduciary rule.\xc2\xa0 And if you would -- I know sometimes inside the beltway, there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a technical aspect to this, but if you would help me make sense of this -- let\'s say somebody in Marshall or Fayette who just wants to understand broadly what the President is aiming for here.\xc2\xa0 And as sort of a second part of that, what about caveat emptor -- buy beware?\xc2\xa0 How much is the responsibility also on the investor to do that right thing?\xc2\xa0 So if you could explain, I\'d appreciate it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The core principle here, Kevin, is fairness.\xc2\xa0 And right now the President believes that financial advisors who are offering people retirement advice should do a pretty common-sense thing, which is that they should put the interest of their customer ahead of their own financial interests.\xc2\xa0 Right now there are some financial advisors who don\xe2\x80\x99t abide by what\'s called the fiduciary standard, and instead what they do is they actually try to sell certain retirement products to their customers, even if those products may not be exactly right for their customer, given their customer\'s age or wealth.\xc2\xa0 But by selling them those products, there are incentives that the retirement advisor, the financial advisor gets access to.\xc2\xa0 They get kickbacks from the company that created the instrument in the first place, or they can be rewarded with a free cruise for themselves and their family if they sell enough shares in this particular product.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it\'s not fair for financial advisors to give advice for their customers that isn\xe2\x80\x99t in their customer\'s best interest.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not honest.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not fair.\xc2\xa0 And so all the President is saying is, if you are doing this the right way, if you are abiding by the fiduciary standard, if you are eliminating that conflict of interest and making clear to your customer that your customer\'s interest comes first, then this rule doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any impact on you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis rule is aimed at those financial advisors that aren\xe2\x80\x99t disclosing that conflict of interest and that are not appropriately looking out for the long-term financial interests of their customers who are looking to save a little money for retirement.\xc2\xa0 The consequences are significant.\xc2\xa0 At least one study indicates that American families lose $17 billion each year because the advice that they\'re getting is not in their own personal financial interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President has made access to a secure retirement a top priority.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure that every family, particularly middle-class families, have access to a secure retirement.\xc2\xa0 And if there are people who are going to financial advisors who are not acting in their best interest and are causing the system to bleed $17 billion in losses every year, that makes it harder for people to retire securely.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President -- or the Department of Labor, I think in this case, has put forward a rule that is focused on the simple, common-sense fairness of people who are trying to do the right thing by responsibly saving for retirement.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you answer the second part of that question about "buyer beware -- you have a responsibility as well"?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, and I think that is part of this problem, is that individual retirement advisors didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to disclose whether or not they were acting in their customer\'s best interest.\xc2\xa0 And this rule makes clear that if you want to offer people retirement advice, that you have to put the financial interests of your customers first.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and last one for me.\xc2\xa0 You may have seen this in the Post about paid administrative leave in federal agencies.\xc2\xa0 Some pretty staggering numbers.\xc2\xa0 GAO cited in this report by the Post that to the tune of millions of dollars have been wasted effectively by federal employees who have been placed on administrative leave and then receive full pay, full benefits, only to come back to work, effectively getting sometimes years of paid leave.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that full report.\xc2\xa0 I can just tell you in general that this administration has worked hard to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, particularly when it comes to the use of taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that we take quite seriously.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of ways in which we have approached this, including everything from -- including most importantly, I should say, taking a look at old regulations and figuring out what sort of regulations don\xe2\x80\x99t make sense anymore.\xc2\xa0 And by eliminating those old regulations that don\xe2\x80\x99t really apply, we can actually do something quite significant to save taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just one example of the kinds of steps that we have taken to make sure that this administration is a good steward of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill, nice to see you today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 You devoted considerable time yesterday and some today in saying that there was no connection between the publication of the inversion rule and the cessation of the merger plan between Allergan and Pfizer.\xc2\xa0 Pfizer said they dropped it because of the rule.\xc2\xa0 Why should anybody believe that the timing had nothing to do with it, that the timing was not coincidental?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess the reason that people should -- the thing that people should understand is that this rule was under development and being considered by the Treasury Department four years -- years -- before these two companies even announced that that they were considering a corporate inversion.\xc2\xa0 So this is a long thought-out strategy here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But the news of their pending inversion has been in the papers for days.\xc2\xa0 So it was obviously about to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'ll let them speak to the timing of when they were expecting to consummate their transaction.\xc2\xa0 I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any insight into when exactly they were planning to move forward with their transaction.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the focus of this rule was to close a loophole that, yes, we knew that corporations were considering taking advantage of.\xc2\xa0 There\'s no denying that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the whole reason we closed the loophole in the first place.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason we targeted the loophole -- because we knew it was possible for corporations to use that loophole to avoid paying their fair share.\xc2\xa0 And we went out to close it.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\'s move around.\xc2\xa0 Andrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President considering sending more troops to Iraq?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Andrew, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any decisions to announce from here.\xc2\xa0 In considering our counter-ISIL strategy, the instructions that the President has given to his team are something that we\'ve talked about publicly quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have a very multifaceted strategy when it comes to degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.\xc2\xa0 It includes carrying out military airstrikes.\xc2\xa0 It includes building the capacity of fighting forces on the ground, in Iraq and in Syria, to take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.\xc2\xa0 Our strategy includes countering the efforts of ISIL to finance their activities.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur efforts include shutting down or at least countering the ability of ISIL to recruit fighters to their cause.\xc2\xa0 Our efforts include working collaboratively with countries around the world to prevent potential foreign fighters from traveling to Iraq and in Syria in the first place.\xc2\xa0 And in each of those lines of effort, we\'ve made important progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are seeing that ISIL is struggling to pay their fighters as much as they were before.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing that the number of fighters -- foreign fighters in Iraq and in Syria is lower than it has been before.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing more voices, particularly in the Muslim world, speaking out against the hateful ideology of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing the capacity of fighting forces on the ground in Iraq and in Syria be enhanced.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing more airstrikes being taken against ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 We are seeing that ISIL is having to withdraw from about 40 percent of the territory that they previously held in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The percentage is smaller in Syria.\xc2\xa0 But there are tens of thousands of square kilometers inside of Syria that ISIL used to control that they don\'t anymore.\xc2\xa0 All of that is a result of the efforts that we have undertaken.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the President has said is if there is an opportunity for us to devote more resources to a particular aspect of our strategy that would allow us to yield more success, then bring me those ideas.\xc2\xa0 And so there are a couple examples of that.\xc2\xa0 One thing that we have seen that has been useful is to put U.S. and coalition military personnel on the ground in Iraq and in Syria to provide some advice and assistance to troops that are fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President recognized that was a strategy that was yielding some fruit in Iraq, and he decided to try that strategy in Syria, as well.\xc2\xa0 And so there are Special Operations Forces in Syria right now -- a small number -- but that small number of U.S. military personnel is working to offer advice and assistance to forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is looking for ways that we can reinforce those aspects of our strategy that are yielding some progress.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to make more progress by putting more resources behind one particular line of effort, then the President wants to see those kinds of recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo at the same time, I guess just because you raise the prospect, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand what we\'re not doing.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to devote tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel on the ground in Iraq and in Syria in a combat role.\xc2\xa0 We tried that.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t work.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t address the situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And it doesn\'t make the United States of America safer.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is one that is not going to solve this problem overnight, but it is going to make us safer.\xc2\xa0 It is going to put additional pressure against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And it is more likely to lead to the kind of political outcome that we know will be required in Syria for sure, and to a different extent in Iraq, to eventually solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what we\'re focused on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that regard, has he asked for or received any updates on the troop levels or troop posture since the beginning of the Mosul offensive?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been reviewing progress on the ground.\xc2\xa0 The President every couple of weeks meets with his broader national security team to talk about the progress of the counter-ISIL coalition.\xc2\xa0 And that includes a regular update about the resources that are being devoted to particular lines of effort.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything to tell you publicly at this point about any additional requests that have been made by the Department of Defense or any other member of his national security team.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 With the President going back tomorrow to the school where he once taught constitutional law, he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that senators, Republican senators are not doing their constitutional duty in blocking confirmation hearings for Judge Garland.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, over the last two terms, Republicans have often criticized the President for exceeding his constitutional authority.\xc2\xa0 I know that\'s not an unusual charge to come from Congress.\xc2\xa0 But in a couple of big cases, the courts have dealt him setbacks on that front -- like immigration, for example.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering can you say how the President\xe2\x80\x99s views have changed about the limits of presidential power since he was a law school instructor?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be hard for me to answer.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one that probably is best for him to answer.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bring him out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We could just -- like we did yesterday, just do it again?\xc2\xa0 Let me go see if he\xe2\x80\x99s available, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- (laughter).\xc2\xa0 I think -- I suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity -- the President will take some questions from the audience at the event tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s the potential that somebody would ask him this question tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think in general the President believes -- and I think his record bears this out -- that he has been rather conscientious about aggressively using executive authority within the confines of the law to make progress where Congress has refused.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd more often than not, when those questions have been raised in the courts, the administration has won.\xc2\xa0 I think the numerous health care cases I think is a good illustration of that.\xc2\xa0 You cited some examples where we have not seen the outcome that we would like.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President while serving in office does appreciate how important executive authority is.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen and our economy has benefitted from some of the decisions that the President has made or his administration has made using executive authority.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe irony, Dave, is that nobody questions the responsibility of the President of the United States to nominate someone to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 That\'s written into the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 Rather, what we\'re seeing is we\'re seeing Republicans refuse to fulfill their basic responsibility that\'s written into the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 So, in some ways, I think you\'re asking both an interesting and legitimate question about the President\'s view of executive authority.\xc2\xa0 I think to give you a full answer it would probably require some more insight into the President\'s thinking, and I think you\'d probably get a thoughtful answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to the basic congressional responsibility in terms of considering Supreme Court nominees, that\'s a whole lot more straightforward and something I\'m sure the President will talk about more tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any guidance on when we\'ll get President Obama\'s tax returns?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any guidance about that right now.\xc2\xa0 We will provide them before the filing deadline, which I believe this year is actually April 18th.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll have them before then.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His schedule today that you\'ve given us is pretty light.\xc2\xa0 Anything he\'s doing that you can tell us about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the day today?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yeah.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has got some meetings with members of his team here.\xc2\xa0 It is a little quieter than usual just as the President prepares for a three-day trip at the end of this week.\xc2\xa0 And obviously the President was working a little later yesterday when he was hosting the combatant commanders here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 But nothing specific I can tell you about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you confirm that he\'s doing a Sunday Show interview tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the President, while in Chicago, will tape an interview with Chris Wallace for Fox News Sunday.\xc2\xa0 It\'s the first time that the President has appeared on that program as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 He\'s done at least one other interview with Mr. Wallace since becoming President, and he did an interview for that program before being elected President.\xc2\xa0 This will be the first time that he\'s on that program exclusively as a guest, as President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s your thinking in doing it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is an opportunity for the President to -- well, let me say it this way.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Mr. Wallace is traveling to Chicago and will interview the President at the University of Chicago Law School.\xc2\xa0 So I think part of our expectation in terms of preparing the President for the interview is that Mr. Wallace will want to talk to him about the Supreme Court nomination that he\'s put forward.\xc2\xa0 And this is obviously something that Mr. Wallace has questioned his guests about quite frequently over the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 And I would anticipate that that will be true of this week\'s program, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut while that will obviously be an important topic for the interview, I expect, I also expect that Mr. Wallace will ask him about some other things, too.\xc2\xa0 But look, the President is looking forward to it.\xc2\xa0 And I think any time that the President is doing an interview with a television program that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done an interview with for a while, it\'s an opportunity to reach a new audience, or at least an audience that may not have heard from the President directly in a while.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like a particularly good opportunity to make a strong case that the United States Congress should fulfill their constitutional responsibility to confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court that even Republicans describe as a consensus nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What audience do you think he\'ll be reaching by going on Fox?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as Mr. Wallace I think would point out to you, that his audience is not just Fox News viewers, but it also Fox broadcast viewers.\xc2\xa0 And this is -- I\'m not up to date, maybe Kevin could fill me on the latest ratings of the Sunday shows -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But look, obviously Mr. Wallace has a well-establish reputation for asking tough questions, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody is expecting a softball interview here.\xc2\xa0 But I also think that there\'s some important issues to talk about.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly looking forward to a thoughtful and serious conversation about some of these important issues.\xc2\xa0 And at least for the context in which this interview is taking place, the Supreme Court will be at the top of the list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he in the exit interview phase now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
