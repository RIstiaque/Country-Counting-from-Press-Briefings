CDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Press Force One here, the press vehicle as part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s motorcade, as we make our way through Iowa on this glorious day -- day two of our trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, the President is going to talk about the importance today of renewable wind energy to our economy.\xc2\xa0 And as a matter of policy, I think you know that the President has made clear that clean, renewable wind energy is a critical part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that aims to develop more secure domestic energy sources while strengthening American manufacturing and supporting American jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Obama administration has made the largest investment in clean energy in history, and the United States has doubled renewable energy since 2008.\xc2\xa0 Today, the Department of Energy released -- will release a report that underscores the dramatic expansion of wind energy and the U.S. manufacturing that is supporting this surge.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn 2011, the United States was one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest and fastest-growing wind markets in the world, with wind power representing 32 percent of all new electric capacity added in the United States last year, second only --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, what was that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thirty-two percent of all new electric capacity added in the United States last year, second only to natural gas.\xc2\xa0 As a result, $14 billion was invested in the United States, diversifying our energy economy, expanding American manufacturing, and supporting American jobs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIndustry numbers show that this industry now supports 75,000 jobs across the country, including thousands of jobs here in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Not only did wind energy surge in 2011, the percent of wind equipment made in the United States has expanded dramatically.\xc2\xa0 I think that some of you have seen, along the highways here in Iowa, trucks carrying large wind turbine blades.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There was a wind turbine at the State Fair last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or the wind turbine at the State Fair -- just all across the landscape here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNearly 70 percent of the equipment installed at U.S. wind farms last year -- including wind turbines and components like towers, blades, gears, and generators -- was made here in the United States, up from just 35 percent in 2005.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAt the end of 2011, the states with the most installed wind capacity included Texas, Iowa, California, Illinois, Minnesota, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma, Colorado, and North Dakota.\xc2\xa0 These states account for almost 75 percent of U.S. wind capacity, or more than 34 gigawatts -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of gigawatts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDespite the recent growth in wind installations and manufacturing, the DOE 2011 Wind Technologies Market Report, which is an annual report, finds that 2013 may see a dramatic slowing of domestic wind energy deployment due in part -- let me just repeat that -- may see a dramatic slowing of domestic wind energy deployment due in part to the possible expiration of federal renewable energy tax incentives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe production tax credit, also known as the wind energy tax credit, which provides an important credit to wind producers in the United States, has helped drive the industry\xe2\x80\x99s growth and it is set to expire at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 The wind industry projects that 37,000 jobs could be lost if the production tax credit is allowed to expire.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, support for this tax credit is bipartisan.\xc2\xa0 Senators and governors of both parties, Republicans in states like Iowa, support the extension of this tax credit.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, thus far, the obstacles have been Republicans in Washington, especially in the House of Representatives.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And if I could just add a couple more points about the remarks today.\xc2\xa0 So the President will also talk about a plant in Newton, Iowa that used to be a Maytag plant that shut down and now is making wind turbines.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been able to revitalize the community there, and it\xe2\x80\x99s really a story about how investing in clean energy, investing in the kind of innovative technologies, like wind turbines, is really helping communities grow and thrive in places like Iowa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe were in -- some of you were with us last week when we were in Pueblo, Colorado.\xc2\xa0 There was a story in the local paper in Colorado today announcing that they had to lay off 100 -- 20 percent -- of their workers as a result of the wind tax credit being not extended.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a story from another state.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, finally, just to echo what Jay say about it being bipartisan -- Republicans in Iowa, including Governor Terry Branstad, including Congressman Steve King, are in utter disbelief that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, his running mate, have opposed the tax credit.\xc2\xa0 Not only have they opposed it, Mitt Romney called the benefits of wind energy \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And Paul Ryan called this a \xe2\x80\x9cfad.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about that in his remarks today.\xc2\xa0 And it shows, again, their complete misunderstanding of what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the growth of the economy in Iowa and the industries that are helping communities like Newton, like Oskaloosa thrive and grow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne other thing I just wanted to make sure you saw this morning -- the campaign put out another -- a web video in response to the second ad that the Romney campaign did, that is a bold-faced lie, about the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on welfare.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s something just to look out for.\xc2\xa0 And I will say this is an issue where President Clinton, countless economists, countless fact-checkers have said this is a mischaracterization of the President\xe2\x80\x99s record.\xc2\xa0 And they continue to put millions of dollars behind ads across the state.\xc2\xa0 This is a central argument, which, again, is false, about their record.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting a little animated here.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Syria -- the former prime minister defected.\xc2\xa0 He said he was joining the rebels.\xc2\xa0 And he said today that the regime appears to be close to collapse.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any sense of whether some sort of collapse could happen within days?\xc2\xa0 And are there any steps that the administration is considering -- additional aid, perhaps additional sanctions -- to sort of push it in that direction?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question, Ken, that we have seen a series of high-level defections from the Assad regime, both its government and its military leadership.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen defections at middle and lower levels, and we expect this to continue.\xc2\xa0 It demonstrates the fact that Assad no longer has control over his country, and reinforces the fact that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future cannot and will not include Assad.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe sooner that Assad steps aside, the sooner the Syrian people will be able to complete a political transition in that country that will give them a better chance at a future that includes prosperity and a government that represents the interest of the people and responds to the aspirations of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 We have said that we believe Assad\xe2\x80\x99s days are numbered, but I would not hazard a guess at how many days are left in his tenure.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe are doing everything we can with our allies to tighten the noose, if you will, around Assad through diplomatic and financial means, through sanctions and international pressure.\xc2\xa0 We recently announced new sanctions out of the Treasury Department.\xc2\xa0 And you can expect that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look for ways to increase the pressure on Assad and deprive Assad of the funds that he depends on to wage war against his own people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, while President Obama is here talking about wind energy, we expect Mitt Romney to be in another part of the country talking about energy of a different kind.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering, is that a contrast that the President will speak to directly?\xc2\xa0 And also, are you concerned that some swing voters may not be prepared to abandon traditional energy sources and will see this as that choice?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me start, as a matter of policy, that, as I mentioned before, the President has pursued an all-of-the-above energy strategy that has resulted in an increase of domestic oil and gas production; has resulted in a decrease in imports of foreign oil; has resulted in, because of the investments this administration has made, a doubling of renewable energy production in this country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that all-of-the-above strategy is the best and only way to achieve the energy independence that this country needs for economic, environmental, and national security reasons.\xc2\xa0 You have to be a member of the Flat Earth Society to not recognize that we need to exploit all means of domestic energy production.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 And let me just add one thing to Margaret.\xc2\xa0 And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you quite -- were you asking about Romney\'s Ohio --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just contrasting the -- it\'s obviously energy day on the campaign trail today, and I\'m just -- so I guess my question is, what do you make out of that, the fact that they\'re answering your energy message with their own energy message?\xc2\xa0 And do you have some concerns that swing voters may be -- may think that their choice is wind energy versus traditional energy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 So just to add to what Jay said, actions speak louder than words.\xc2\xa0 And the American people are smart, and people in states like Iowa and Ohio study the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 records, they study what they stand for and what their policies are.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn addition to what we\'ve already talked about, about wind energy and what Jay mentioned about the President\'s all-above energy plan -- on coal, which I understand is what Mitt Romney plans to attack the President on today, let\'s not forget that Mitt Romney has been a longtime critic; he once said that coal-fired plants kill people in Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 And the President\'s record on this has been one where he\'s invested in clean coal energy technology.\xc2\xa0 The coal industry employment is at a 15-year high.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, the record speaks for itself, and we\'re happy to stand by ours.\xc2\xa0 And if you look at -- just because you say something, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that your record is backing it up.\xc2\xa0 And their claim that they are for an all-above energy strategy just isn\'t backed up by the policies that they\'re out there talking about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, to both of you, Iowa was sort of the -- was the state that kind of galvanized then-senator Obama\'s campaign for the presidency.\xc2\xa0 In this three-day bus trip, does he feel like he\'s rekindling any of that old magic?\xc2\xa0 How is he feeling?\xc2\xa0 How are you guys feeling about it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will say he\'s in -- I think he\'s having a great time meeting people, seeing familiar faces, seeing new faces.\xc2\xa0 He\'s met countless people who have said, I was with you in \'08, I\'m with you again; people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been voters before who are getting engaged in the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is, as you touched on, this is where the journey began for him, and where it began for the First Lady, and Iowa will always have a special place in their hearts.\xc2\xa0 And they know the people in Iowa expect they\'re going to lift the hood -- be able to lift the hood and kick the tires, ask tough questions, hear about specific policy answers.\xc2\xa0 And spending three days allows us to go from one side of the state to the other, to meet people who are farmers, people who are working on wind turbines, people who are working in cities.\xc2\xa0 And it gives him a taste and flavor of what everybody is going through in the state.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons we\'re spending the time we are here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just in terms of the President -- and you\'ve seen it at the events and, most recently, this morning at Coffee Connection in Knoxville -- a terrific enterprise where I enjoyed an egg-and-ham sandwich as well as a large coffee and I bought a T-shirt -- he\'s in a great mood.\xc2\xa0 He loves being out on the road.\xc2\xa0 He loves being in Iowa.\xc2\xa0 On the bus, you can just feel his energy, and it\'s real fun to be out here with him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the T-shirt say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It says "Coffee Connection" on the front, and "Life is too short to drink cheap coffee" on the back.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s up with the Republican owner of the Coffee Connection?\xc2\xa0 I mean, did you guys know he was Republican?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The way that we pick places like that, we come up with a couple of options that people locally go and spend time -- because when the President is coming, we\'re not giving them an hour notice.\xc2\xa0 So Coffee Connection is a coffee place in Knoxville where people are usually there at 10:00 in the morning, and we knew the President could pop in.\xc2\xa0 It was a great place.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t party-I.D. people when we go to local establishments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we loved the small business owner.\xc2\xa0 We loved his story and we loved his coffee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Medicare -- why should people 55 years old or older be concerned about the Paul Ryan Medicare plan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 One, just on the top line, there is a clear difference between what President Obama is talking about on Medicare, what his plan is and what the Romney/Ryan plan is.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney said yesterday that they\'re very close on issues, that there is no space between them on issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not an exact quote but a paraphrase.\xc2\xa0 So I think we can all safely assume that they\'re on the same place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo for today\'s seniors, with the Romney/Ryan plan, prescription drugs would go up, out-of-pocket expenses would go up, benefits would go down, Medicare would become insolvent in four years.\xc2\xa0 After the Ryan plan kicks in, Medicare would be completely destabilized once it kicks in.\xc2\xa0 Younger, healthier seniors would purchase low-cost vouchers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhat we know, bottom line, is that President Obama\'s plan strengthens and extends the life of the program.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney/Paul Ryan\'s plan leaves the cost on the back of seniors.\xc2\xa0 This is one of the reasons why, if you look at -- I\'m sure all of you are very busy, you\'re not flipping through the Florida clips every day -- but typically, when a vice presidential nominee is announced, there is a huge bump, everybody is happy, excited, there\'s energy around it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis has been a stumbling-out-of-the-starting block situation for them, where, in Florida, there were -- people in Florida were woken up every day to this -- since he was announced -- to headlines like, Miami Herald:\xc2\xa0 "Ryan Could Be A Drag On Romney In Florida"; St. Petersburg Blog:\xc2\xa0 "Ryan Won\'t Be With Romney In Florida Tomorrow; Is He Medi-Scared?" -- quite a play on words -- Tampa Tribune:\xc2\xa0 "Romney\'s VP Choice Could Be Risky In Swing State Of Florida."\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not typically what you get, and we know it\'s because their radical budget could have a devastating impact on not just seniors -- but that is one area where it certainly could -- but college students.\xc2\xa0 And this is an area where we know we\'ll continue to be having a debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that something that the President will start addressing as well today, or otherwise on the trail -- specifically Medicare in general and Congressman Ryan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney is our opponent, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And to the degree Paul Ryan is -- Paul Ryan of course is his running mate, as you also know.\xc2\xa0 And it really -- him picking Paul Ryan further solidifies his beliefs, his embrace of the radical budget, his embrace of these \xe2\x80\x9clet\'s go back to the 1950s\xe2\x80\x9d approaches to women\'s issues.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President is going to be talking about wind today, and the difference between his vision and the Romney/Ryan vision.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\'ll hear from him today.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s clear there\'s a contrast on their budgets -- I mean, I\'m sorry, on their approaches to the economy, including their approach to the budget.\xc2\xa0 And we know that will continue to be part of the debate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he just address it, then?\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he talk about Medicare if that\xe2\x80\x99s what everybody is concerned about?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We have almost 90 days left.\xc2\xa0 You never know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to get ahead of where we are today.\xc2\xa0 Today we\'re talking about wind, but in Florida they\'re talking about Medicare.\xc2\xa0 In other states, they\'re talking about the drastic impact on women\'s issues.\xc2\xa0 In other states, they\'re talking about how this will impact student aid.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe know this is an important part of the debate.\xc2\xa0 Mitt Romney\'s position is Paul Ryan\'s position.\xc2\xa0 They\'re running on the same ticket, and their approach to Medicare and their approach to health care would be devastating for people across this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us some examples, as far as like the women\'s issues that you guys are concerned about, what are some of these things that Romney and Ryan have in mind that are bad?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, how long do you have?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Look, I think they\'ve been very clear that they want to go back to a time when women could not make choices about their own health care; where contraception is not a part of what employers are providing.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve made this an issue that has taken us back in time, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something that women across the country are concerned about.\xc2\xa0 You heard Sandra Fluke introduce the President last week.\xc2\xa0 And also, I\'ll add in equal pay, ensuring women have equal pay.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not a priority for the Republican ticket, and I think it raises a lot of red flags for women across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the production tax credit, if Congress fails to act, is there anything that the administration can do on its own administratively or with an executive order?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is that on the table?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say broadly that when it comes to taking measures to help our economy grow and help sectors of our economy like wind energy production, the President is always evaluating every option, including administrative options.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHowever, Congress has the responsibility and the authority to act on renewal of the production tax credit, and it\'s in Congress\'s court to take this action.\xc2\xa0 The President strongly supports it; there is bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve heard Republican officials, both in Iowa and elsewhere, say how surprised they are by the opposition in Washington from leaders in the House and Senate, including, for example, Paul Ryan, who don\xe2\x80\x99t support renewal of this important wind energy tax credit.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what is shocking about it -- because it goes to the all-of-the-above energy strategy that the President has put in place -- is that they don\xe2\x80\x99t support an energy tax credit that has bipartisan support out in the country that helps an industry that is growing in the 21st century and will be an increasingly important part of our energy portfolio in the 21st century, but they refuse to forego or support the elimination of loopholes and tax benefits, and subsidies for oil and gas companies, which, of course, as you know, over the past several years have enjoyed historically high profits.\xc2\xa0 I think that says a lot about their backward-looking view when it comes to our energy future.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that credit go back to \'05?\xc2\xa0 Is that why that date -- you gave a stat of how much more production there has been since \'05.\xc2\xa0 Is that when the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'d have to check.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure how old the tax credit is, but it has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we hear the President say anything about ethanol while he\'s in Iowa?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 He spoke about it yesterday when he was meeting with some rural reporters.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Let me look up and see if I can get you something from that.\xc2\xa0 Ethanol is -- he has been a strong supporter of ethanol and cellulosic ethanol.\xc2\xa0 He absolutely believes in it, he thinks it\'s a driver of the economy here and a key component of renewable energy.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check and see if there\'s any plans to include it in remarks otherwise and see if I can get you something more specific.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were the local reporters asking him, specifically in the drought conditions, about like livestock feed cost and stuff?\xc2\xa0 Or --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 No, just about access -- just about renewable energy, given it\'s such an important issue here in Iowa, and all the ways that they can grow those industries in Iowa.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne thing just to add on your health care question, or women\'s question -- and this is a fairly obvious one, I can\'t believe I forgot to mention -- the fact that Mitt Romney wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have a devastating impact on women, not just on cost but on the elimination -- right now, women can get pre-screenings for mammograms, Pap smears.\xc2\xa0 They also want to defund Planned Parenthood.\xc2\xa0 The list goes on and on -- but those are two key ones I would also add.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you listed off the ways that the Ryan budget would affect seniors who are now over 55, those first things were things that fell in the category of repealing the Affordable Care Act, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s very much part of the Ryan budget.\xc2\xa0 And I think an elemental fact that has to be reckoned with here is that the Romney/Ryan approach, the Republican approach to Medicare is one that ends it as we know it over time, not to make investments in energy or education or innovation, but to provide substantial new tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.\xc2\xa0 The savings that are found, that are withdrawn from Medicare in the Republican plan come from cost-shifting, as opposed to the savings that have been put forward by the President through the Affordable Care Act and through his own budget proposals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe end result, as the Congressional Budget Office has said, is an extra $6,200 per year per senior for their health care costs.\xc2\xa0 And seniors across the country simply, by and large, cannot afford that.\xc2\xa0 And what happens when you voucherize the program, as a matter of policy, is that, as Jen mentioned, younger, healthier seniors take advantage of private plans, which drive up -- and private plans don\xe2\x80\x99t want older, less healthy seniors, and they remain in traditional Medicare creating a situation where traditional Medicare is not financially stable, and it creates what\'s called in the business a "death spiral" for Medicare.\xc2\xa0 That is not a happy message, I think, to take to America\'s seniors.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- today in his remarks in terms of defending his posture on --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 The remarks focus on the wind tax credit, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get you or anybody specifics on his record versus Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s record so let me know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything on the White House beer since we\xe2\x80\x99re -- the tape is rolling?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, explain that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He surprised all of us -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What do you mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s the deal?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been written about and talked about before that the White -- that there is a home brew, if you will, at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he regularly travel with it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he drink it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- moving this at interstate commerce.\xc2\xa0 Does the Treasury Department know about this?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to take those questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you tasted it, Jay?\xc2\xa0 What does it taste like?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is superb.\xc2\xa0 It is quite good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s the beer master?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it light beer?\xc2\xa0 Heavy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President said there are two types -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a light and a dark.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve only tried the light, and it\xe2\x80\x99s quite refreshing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President drink it sometimes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have seen him, yes, have a --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the beer summit, the White House beer was not observed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I think that may have been pre --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that may have been before they had White House beer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any other distilleries in the White House we don\xe2\x80\x99t know about?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on behind the trees on the South Lawn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Qui\xc3\xb1oa for healthy living.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s the beer master?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I have exhausted my knowledge about this subject.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Usually, when somebody hands me a beer I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask how it was made.\xc2\xa0 I just drink it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I will add, since some of you asked, last night at the fair, a combination of David Axelrod, David Plouffe, myself, Jon Favreau, Alyssa Mastromonaco, and Eugene Kang probably ate half a dozen turkey legs, a dozen fried Oreos, four fried Snickers, fried Twinkies, fried ho-hos -- we really did it up at the fair.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all still functioning today.\xc2\xa0 The fried Oreos, I think, is a group favorite so if you have the chance to go out --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jen left out that they had a few beers, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We did.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all above 21.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:17 A.M. CDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
