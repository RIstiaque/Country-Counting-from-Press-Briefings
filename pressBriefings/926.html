Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t1:35 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 It\'s good to see you.\xc2\xa0 I hope you had a terrific weekend.\xc2\xa0 And I have no announcements to make at the top, so I\'ll go straight to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the election of Francois Hollande in France increase your concern that a change in the European economy, a shift away from austerity could worsen the economic situation there and drag the United States down with it?\xc2\xa0 And secondarily, what would the President\'s role be in any bridging between Hollande and Merkel?\xc2\xa0 Will he be directly involved in that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me first say that President Obama, as you know, called President-elect Francois Hollande of France yesterday to congratulate him.\xc2\xa0 In that discussion, President Obama indicated that he looks forward to working closely with Mr. Hollande and his government on a range of shared economic and security challenges.\xc2\xa0 President Obama looks forward to welcoming President-elect Hollande to Camp David for the G8 and then to Chicago for the NATO summit.\xc2\xa0 And he proposed that the two men meet beforehand at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresident Obama and President-elect Hollande each reaffirmed in that phone call the important and enduring alliance between the people of the United States and France.\xc2\xa0 And that alliance is strong, and as strong today as it was last week.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the situation in Europe, as the President said just the other day, our economy continues to face some headwinds and the eurozone crisis is one of them.\xc2\xa0 That is why he has worked directly with his counterparts in Europe, why Secretary Geithner has worked with his counterparts in Europe, to advise and consult on the issue of how best to contain the situation in Europe, how best to get control of it.\xc2\xa0 European leaders have taken very significant steps towards dealing with that eurozone crisis and the President and Secretary Geithner and others in the administration will continue to work with European leaders towards that end.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that basically answers your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, not exactly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, one of the leaders who took those steps just got ousted.\xc2\xa0 And his replacement is someone who is on record as being opposed to several of the steps that you all applauded in establishing greater security through -- largely through austerity measures.\xc2\xa0 He says he wants to take a step back from that.\xc2\xa0 Does that make that headwind you referred to stronger?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would make two points.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we will not negotiate on behalf of European countries here at the White House -- or between European countries here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I would say that the President has made clear frequently, as he did in Cannes at the G20, that he believes a balanced approach towards fiscal consolidation -- that includes both fiscal consolidation and efforts to continue to boost the recovery is the right approach for Europe.\xc2\xa0 He has taken an approach here in the United States that has been aimed at growing the economy and creating jobs in the short term as well as dealing with our deficits and debt challenges in the medium and long terms.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an approach that he thinks ensures that the recovery continues, but also gets our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have one more on a different subject.\xc2\xa0 This morning, the Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, put himself on record in favor of gay marriage.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the Vice President indicated something along the same lines.\xc2\xa0 Does this box the President in ahead of the election?\xc2\xa0 Have his views changed at all on this subject?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no update on the President\'s personal views.\xc2\xa0 What the Vice President said yesterday was to make the same point that the President has made previously, that committed and loving same-sex couples deserve the same rights and protections enjoyed by all Americans, and that we oppose any effort to roll back those rights.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why this administration opposes the Defense of Marriage Act and supports legislation to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 The administration also has stopped defending the constitutionality of Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in legal challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecretary Duncan was asked a question about his personal views on an issue and he offered them.\xc2\xa0 And obviously this is an issue that many people have a view on and we respect the right of all people to have an opinion -- a personal opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If asked at this point a similar question for his personal view, would the President give it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is the right person to describe his own personal views.\xc2\xa0 He, as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, and I don\'t have an update for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had one more on the French election.\xc2\xa0 The incoming President Hollande is promising a pro-growth approach as an alternative to strict austerity.\xc2\xa0 Is this an approach that the Obama administration could support?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, each country has its own circumstances.\xc2\xa0 Europe has its own distinct problems with the eurozone crisis, and we\'re not going to dictate to any country or any collection of countries what policies they should pursue.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has said, as he said in Cannes at the G20, that a balanced approach towards fiscal consolidation and growth is what he believes is appropriate -- that\'s the approach he\'s taken here.</p>\n<p>\n\tEuropeans have taken a number of significant steps towards dealing with this crisis and more needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 We have said that for quite some time now and our view on that has not changed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be sending Secretary Geithner over to hold discussions with European counterparts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any scheduling announcements to make on behalf of Secretary Geithner, but I think, as you know, Matt, the Treasury Secretary has made numerous visits to Europe to discuss eurozone issues with his counterparts there and I\'m sure he has not made his last visit there.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the President has raised millions of dollars from LGBT donors, many of whom say that they believe in a second term the President will come out in support of gay marriage.\xc2\xa0 So doesn\'t he owe them -- or owe voters in general -- his direct response and just stop dancing around the issue and telling voters will he or won\xe2\x80\x99t he support gay marriage in a second term?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was asked this and said that his views on -- his personal views on this were evolving.\xc2\xa0 The President does have, as you noted, significant support in the LGBT community, and that\'s because of his unparalleled record in support of LGBT rights.\xc2\xa0 That includes the fight to repeal successfully "don\'t ask, don\'t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 It includes signing hate crimes legislation that includes LGBT persons.\xc2\xa0 It includes ending a legal defense of the Defense of Marriage Act.\xc2\xa0 It includes --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he says to these audiences --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- ensuring hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, and I could go on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On June 23rd --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 His record on the LGBT rights is simply unparalleled, and he will continue to fight for those rights going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on June 23rd, he told an LGBT audience, \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody deserves to be able to live and love as they see fit.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have to tell the people in this room we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a ways to go in the struggle.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is he referring to if not gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you have heard him say and those in the administration like myself who speak for him that he strongly opposes efforts to restrict rights, to repeal rights for same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 He has made his opposition to those efforts in various states known and will continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of obvious fact that full enjoyment of rights by LGBT citizens has not been achieved uniformly across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he has taken a stand on -- in opposition to efforts in some states to deny those rights and discriminate against LGBT citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can you explain then clearly what -- how Vice President Biden, who said, there is a consensus building toward gay marriage in this nation, and then came out yesterday saying that he is absolutely comfortable with men marrying men and women marrying women having equal rights, is not an endorsement of gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the Vice President expressed his personal views.\xc2\xa0 He also said he was evolving on the issue.\xc2\xa0 I think the description --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did he say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He did not say that, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 His spokesperson said that afterwards.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me just be clear, though.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President -- what he said about the protection of rights of citizens is completely consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this issue, and his description of the way the country has moved on this issue I think is wholly accurate.\xc2\xa0 I think we all have seen the data that describes an evolution of views across the country on these issues.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\'s anything surprising about him saying that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re trying to have it both ways before an election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, this President has been extremely aggressive in supporting LGBT rights.\xc2\xa0 He fought against those who oppose the repeal of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d and achieved that in this administration.\xc2\xa0 There are those who want to bring "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" back.\xc2\xa0 He very robustly fights against efforts to restrict or deny rights to LGBT citizens and discriminate against them, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear it, but there\'s a long, long list of the actions that this administration has taken on behalf of LGBT citizens in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a record that the President is very proud of.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to continue with Jessica\xe2\x80\x99s line, but before I do I did want to see if the President had an opportunity to see the hostage video of Warren Weinstein, who has been taken hostage by al Qaeda, and made a direct plead to the President and referenced -- a very personal plea -- and referenced his two daughters and the President\xe2\x80\x99s two daughters -- if there was any response from the President -- if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen it, if he has a response.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I do not believe he\xe2\x80\x99s seen it, or I do not know that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen it.\xc2\xa0 We remain greatly concerned for Mr. Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s safety and his well-being.\xc2\xa0 Our hearts go out to him and his family.\xc2\xa0 We condemn his kidnapping in the strongest terms and call for his immediate release.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. government will continue making every effort to see Mr. Weinstein released safety to his family, but we cannot and will not negotiate with al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And back to the same-sex marriage issue.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the issues is that when asked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s position, the President no longer said he is evolving on the issue.\xc2\xa0 He says, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to make on that.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Stephanie Cutter, a few minutes ago on cable said -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news for you.\xc2\xa0 The suggestion is that there is news there and you guys are just waiting for the proper time to drop it, likely after November.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s your characterization, Jake.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what it means --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President said that he was evolving, and he had -- I think when people have asked him that and he has no update to give them or no change in his views to put forward, that he\xe2\x80\x99s simply saying that I have nothing new for you on that.\xc2\xa0 His position is what it was.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s with regards to his personal views.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I think needs to be remembered here is what he has done in office in support of LGBT rights.\xc2\xa0 And that record is extensive and considerable and unparalleled.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to fight for those rights as long as he\xe2\x80\x99s in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Positing that the President has done more for LGBT individuals than any other President in history -- so you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to say that again -- (laughter) -- the question is --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for this question.\xc2\xa0 When you get to Norah, whatever you want.\xc2\xa0 But the question is, I think there are very few people who think that the President is not going to, after November, whether he\'s reelected or not, come out in favor of same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 I think there are very few people on the President\'s campaign who doubt that; very few people who support the President, very few people who oppose the President who have any doubt that that is what is going to likely happen.\xc2\xa0 And if that is the likely future of the President and this position, given that you don\'t have any news to drop on it where probably his mind has been made up, why not just come out and say it and let voters decide?\xc2\xa0 It seems cynical to hide this until after the election.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I think the President\'s position is well known.\xc2\xa0 He\'s spoken to this.\xc2\xa0 It\'s gotten a great deal of coverage.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update to provide you on the President\'s position.\xc2\xa0 It is what it was.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry you don\'t want to hear about the President\'s support for LGBT rights because it\'s considerable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not that I don\'t want to hear it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to hear the same talking points 15 times in a row.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the -- talking points to you; serious substantial rights to others.\xc2\xa0 Okay?\xc2\xa0 "Don\'t ask, don\'t tell" -- repealing "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" is a serious matter.\xc2\xa0 The efforts that this administration has taken on behalf of LGBT citizens are serious matters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not belittling that, Jay.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about same-sex marriage.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s the context of this discussion. I just don\'t have anything more to give to you on the issue of the President\'s views.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because he\'s still evolving.\xc2\xa0 Not because you don\'t have news for me, it\'s because he\'s still evolving.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is as it was, yes.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNorah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why does the President oppose same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what the President has said in the past, both during his campaign for President in 2008 and in answer to a question at the end of 2010.\xc2\xa0 I really don\'t have an update for you, Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President comfortable with the fact of men marrying men and women marrying women?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is comfortable with same-sex couples, as the President -- the Vice President said, being entitled to the same rights and the civil rights and civil liberties as other Americans.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he has fought for those equal rights and why he\'s opposed efforts to discriminate against LGBT citizens and to take away rights that have been established by law.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Biden -- the Vice President appears to have evolved on the issue, but the President is still evolving -- is that a fair characterization?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will leave it to individuals to describe their own personal views.\xc2\xa0 What I can explain to you is what the President\'s positions are on issues, the actions he has taken at a policy level on behalf of LGBT Americans, and his commitment to continue to take actions on their behalf to protect and defend their rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 You have a number of Democratic governors throughout this country -- Governor O\'Malley, Governor Cuomo, Governor Malloy, to name a view, now the Vice President, who all support same-sex marriage.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t President Obama support same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have an update for you, Norah, on the President\'s position on his personal views.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that he is a absolutely committed supporter of LGBT rights.\xc2\xa0 His record bears that out.\xc2\xa0 It is an unparalleled record of support for LGBT citizens and their rights, and he\'s proud of it and he\'ll run on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think that it\'s important to remember when we talk about those accomplishments under this administration that they are far more than talking points; they are considerable, serious demonstrations of progress, important progress -- progress that others would take away and reverse.\xc2\xa0 This President is committed to not letting that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you now say the Vice President is evolving -- he did not say that, as was pointed out, but he used some key words beyond what Norah just quoted.\xc2\xa0 He also said that they are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he supports same-sex marriage?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was pointing to this statement that the Vice President\'s office put out yesterday describing his statements, and I don\'t have any elaboration on that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that what he said is completely consistent in that paragraph with the President\'s views that LGBT citizens should enjoy the same rights and that they should not be discriminated against.\xc2\xa0 And efforts to take away those rights are something that this President strongly opposes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how come when the President proposes something like the American Jobs Act -- you could name anything -- and he says\xc2\xa0 -- he travels around the country and says, you\'re entitled to press members of Congress, tell them, are they for this or are they against it -- why can\'t you from this podium say whether or not the President supports or opposes same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President has spoken about this, and that his views have not changed and I have no update to give you on them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Quick question on the economy.\xc2\xa0 We saw the President officially roll out his campaign on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 You saw that the Republican National Committee immediately came out with a video quoting him in 2008 saying, you know, the big question in \'08 is going to be, are you going to be better off four years from now?\xc2\xa0 Now on Saturday, he seemed to be saying the big question is, are you going to better off another four years from now?\xc2\xa0 He put out a new ad today -- the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I know that\'s in Chicago, but the President himself seems to be saying -- four years ago he said, the question is, are you going to be better off in four years?\xc2\xa0 Is he buying more time now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has and will continue to defend his record and make a strong case for the actions that he\'s taken to reverse the most cataclysmic decline in our economy that we\'ve experienced in our lifetimes.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen you talk about where we were four years ago, think about it.\xc2\xa0 We were on the precipice of the worst economic decline since the Great Depression -- under the previous administration. When he took office, we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month, okay?\xc2\xa0 We have now seen 25 straight months of private sector job creation, 11 straight quarters of positive economic growth, which stands in contrast to the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the last quarter that his predecessor was in office -- during which the economy shrank 9 percent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, I would argue that most Americans believe that we\'re going in a far better direction now than we were in 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that means we\'re better off than we were four years ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we are better off gaining jobs than losing jobs at a rate of 800,000 per month.\xc2\xa0 We\'re better off growing the economy than we are seeing it shrink at a pace not seen since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 I think indisputably -- do we have further to go?\xc2\xa0 No question.\xc2\xa0 The President says that all the time when he discusses this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe hole dug by the great recession was very deep.\xc2\xa0 The climb out of it is steep, but we have made significant progress. And we need to make sure that we take the steps necessary to continue to grow the economy, that Congress acts on proposals the President has put forward that they have yet to act on to, for example, put teachers back to work and first responders back to work, to put American construction workers back on the job.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the striking things about the recovery that we\'ve seen so far in terms of job creation is that compared with previous recessions -- under President Reagan, for example -- there\'s been a significant drop in government employment during this recovery.\xc2\xa0 That was not the case under previous Presidents. One, at least in recent months, causes of that has been the laying off of teachers around the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President put forward a proposal to ensure that those teachers were brought back into the classroom.\xc2\xa0 Republicans in the Congress opposed it.\xc2\xa0 They had a choice to support teachers or tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans; teachers or subsidies for oil and gas companies.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, they didn\'t choose teachers.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the administration feel like they had to put out a statement clarifying what the Vice President said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know that the -- the office of the Vice President put out a statement.\xc2\xa0 I think that there was a lot of interest generated by the comments and the office of the Vice President put out a statement to make it clear what the Vice President was saying.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut again, I think that there is a little bit of an overreaction here.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President supports and made clear he supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies when it comes to protecting the rights of LGBT citizens, and he also has his own personal views about the issue, as does the President, as do most people.\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s record on LGBT rights is extensive, and he is committed to working to move forward on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say that publicly the President and the Vice President disagree on gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think that\'s what the Vice President said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\'t think that\'s the point.\xc2\xa0 The President and the Vice President and everyone in this administration support the initiatives that this President has taken to protect and defend the rights of all Americans, including LGBT Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it came to the issue of marriage before, there was a time when the President was somebody who believed in deferring it to the states.\xc2\xa0 Does he still feel that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President believes that the states are deciding this issue, and he has made clear --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- clearly a state issue, not a federal issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we certainly oppose efforts to take away rights at a federal level, which some politicians suppose -- a constitutional amendment to deny rights to LGBT Americans across the country -- we oppose that.\xc2\xa0 The President opposes that.\xc2\xa0 States have taken action on this issue, and the President believes that when the process works that it\xe2\x80\x99s a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 He also opposes efforts in states to repeal rights or deny rights to LGBT citizens that have already been established.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what would that put him -- where would the President be then on the amendment in North Carolina that would ban gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, through the campaign -- but the same person opposes efforts to deny the rights of citizens in any state where those rights have been established.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he opposes -- so help me out there.\xc2\xa0 He opposes bans on gay marriage but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet support gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The record is clear that the President has long opposed divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples.\xc2\xa0 That is a position he has taken that precedes his taking a position in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a position he\xe2\x80\x99s taken in other states where this has been an issue. Yes, he is opposed to efforts in states to deny rights that have been provided to citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You understand why there is so much confusion --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he believes that states --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- because you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he opposes bans on gay marriage but he\xe2\x80\x99s not yet for gay marriage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He believes that the states are -- marriage is a state issue, and the states have the right to take action on it.\xc2\xa0 What he opposes is efforts to repeal rights that have been granted to LGBT citizens.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that\'s discriminatory and wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about Greece.\xc2\xa0 I know there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of interest in the French election.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a position on whether Greece -- if Greece decides to pull out of the eurozone?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that they might and that it would set off a greater economic crisis?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we are looking at the eurozone crisis as a whole.\xc2\xa0 We understand that the political parties in Greece are working to form a coalition, and we hope to hear an announcement in the coming days.\xc2\xa0 The Greek people have made many sacrifices to address that country\xe2\x80\x99s economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 And Greece\xe2\x80\x99s economic reform program remains vital to sustaining fiscal stability to spurring economic growth into a more prosperous future for Greece and the entire region.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with Greece, with whom we have an important relationship and a longstanding relationship, and we will continue to support through the IMF Greece\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to implement essential reforms that restore fiscal sustainability and promote economic growth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are, as I said earlier in response to other questions, very mindful of the impact that the situation in Europe can have on the American economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been described as a headwind.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we work so closely with our European counterparts and advise and consult with them on the steps they\xe2\x80\x99re taking to deal with it.\xc2\xa0 And Greece is obviously a part of that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with the Greeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No position yet on whether they -- if they decide there\xe2\x80\x99s -- is there a fear that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave the eurozone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- or anything like that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that stability in Europe is important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly important for America\xe2\x80\x99s economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work with our European counterparts to assist them with that effort in any way we can.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get Laura, and then yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be an effort this summer to have support for gay marriage as part of the Democratic platform.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the platform reflects his views?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the issue of the platform, which hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been developed yet, I would refer you to the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question was whether the President -- this is a question for the President -- whether the President thinks that the platform just kind of doesn\'t matter, which some people say, or whether it really is a statement of his views whatever those may be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of the party\xe2\x80\x99s view and has long been that.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with him.\xc2\xa0 But I think a platform is a statement of a party\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 It is called a Democratic or Republican Party platform.\xc2\xa0 But for questions about the development of that platform I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the DNC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He is the head of his party.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t have a different answer for you, Laura.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a platform that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been developed.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the DNC for questions about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Friday the President said that he\xe2\x80\x99d be putting forward ideas for job creation for Congress to consider.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything different about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be doing this week along those lines?\xc2\xa0 Or is it just another effort at --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President will tomorrow talk about some of the things that Congress should and must do to help the economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t steal his thunder by giving you specifics, but that is certainly going to be a topic of discussion when the President has his event in New York tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there -- do you have any reason to believe that this effort will be more successful than past efforts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think past efforts have to some degree been effective.\xc2\xa0 We have an extension of the payroll tax cut only because of the President\xe2\x80\x99s firm decision to fight for that despite strong resistance from Republicans.\xc2\xa0 We have an extension of the unemployment insurance through the end of the year, the calendar year, because of his fighting for it.\xc2\xa0 And we also have some other measures that have passed -- the STOCK Act and the so-called JOBS Act, other demonstrations of the ability for Congress to come together and work in a bipartisan way to pass legislation that this President can sign, in spite of the fact that we have experienced a considerable amount of gridlock, and despite the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t think Congress will act because the President says Congress must act.\xc2\xa0 I think the Congress will act because the people that sent them here are insisting that they act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why in the end Republicans finally came to an agreement on extending the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 That is why in the end they have come to an agreement among themselves on a variety of other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think that, as you know, every member of the House is up for election this year and a third of the Senate, and each of those members who are running for reelection has to explain to his or her constituents what they did while they were in Washington these last two years.\xc2\xa0 Did they just say no?\xc2\xa0 Did they just block every effort put forward to help the economy grow and create jobs?\xc2\xa0 Or did they actually try to work constructively to get something done?\xc2\xa0 And it is perhaps the need to answer that question in an affirmative way that might compel members of Congress to take a more constructive approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, following up on the Hollande question and the Greek election question, domestically, is the administration planning to go to Congress with an economic package that would include a stimulus plan that could cushion the U.S. from the effects of a possible European recession if the euro deal should, in fact, go down?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward, with the American Jobs Act and the initiatives that he described in the State of the Union that will help create an America built to last, an economy built to last, a number of initiatives that will help this economy continue to grow, will help this economy to continue to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to, as I just mentioned to Laura, talk about initiatives that this Congress could and should pass, the kinds of things that should enjoy bipartisan support if there really is interest in Congress to -- among Republicans in particular -- to -- just one second.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe want to get some -- Lester, are you okay?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.\xc2\xa0 I just have one question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re good.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Somebody give him a seat, please, if you could.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Les, can you wait until Jay finishes answering mine?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Please, somebody give Lester a seat.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then one on al Qaeda --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I sort of got the full answer --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a number of initiatives that are built around the notion that we need to continue to take steps to grow this economy after -- as we\xe2\x80\x99re recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think as I mentioned earlier, the context includes issues like the eurozone crisis, issues like global prices for oil that can create headwinds for our economy.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s one of the reasons why we need to take action here on matters that we can control entirely, which is our capacity to pass legislation that actually does something to help the economy, as opposed to bickering over things when the American people are demanding action.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie -- al Qaeda, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the difference between not negotiating with al Qaeda and releasing prisoners from -- Afghan military prisoners, as reported in The Washington Post?\xc2\xa0 And also, what\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between negotiating with al Qaeda and the Taliban?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating a number of things, Connie.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody would -- I think a lot of ink has been spilled over the differentiation between the Taliban and -- certainly rank-and-file members of the Taliban and al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, on the issue of prisoner releases, the story in The Washington Post, these kinds of decisions are made by battlefield commanders, and I would refer you to ISAF and the DOD on that.\xc2\xa0 They are not made in Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, because of this President\xe2\x80\x99s focus on a specific mission in Afghanistan, it has been this President\xe2\x80\x99s policy and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s policy that the number-one priority of our mission in Afghanistan is to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 The Taliban exists in Afghanistan, and for ultimate peace in Afghanistan there needs to be reconciliation. And that\'s why we have supported Afghan-led efforts towards reconciliation with the Taliban on the conditions that members of the Taliban who wish to reconcile lay down their arms, denounce al Qaeda and sever all ties with al Qaeda, and commit themselves to abiding by the Afghan constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is one of the reasons the President wants to meet with the French President-elect before G8 and NATO is to discuss Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s stand on troop withdrawals from Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President and President-elect Hollande will have a number of issues to discuss.\xc2\xa0 I think he wants to meet with him because he\xe2\x80\x99s just been elected President of one of our oldest allies -- our oldest ally.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to doing that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does his -- does Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s stand jeopardize the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to shore up the alliance in Chicago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we can wait until NATO meets in Chicago to discuss steps going forward on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The President was just in Afghanistan last week, as you know, and his commitment to moving forward with the strategy that he put forward that includes transferring security authority -- the security lead over to the Afghan National Security Forces and ultimately full security lead over to the Afghans by 2014 is something he described last week, and will certainly be a focus of discussion in Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a compromise on the Hill on Export-Import Bank legislation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s hammered together by Hoyer and Cantor.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be supporting that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly support the effort to reach a compromise.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, that this reauthorization take place to help our exports, which is an important component of our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to expanding exports, and he certainly commends those who are working towards finding a compromise.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are a couple of restrictions in there, one of which involves ending export subsidies to airline makers.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specifics for you on the legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to support Charlie Rangel\xe2\x80\x99s reelection?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been asked it before, so I --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sure, you\xe2\x80\x99ll take the question, or, sure, he supports him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Mara.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to get clear on your criteria, you said that you oppose state efforts to take away rights.\xc2\xa0 In North Carolina gays can\'t marry now, so what is the reason to oppose North Carolina?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The referendum would, as I understand it, restrict and deny rights to LGBT Americans.\xc2\xa0 And the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That they currently have in North Carolina?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s my understanding, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 My other question is, is marriage a civil liberty?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have to ask civil libertarians or lawyers?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in the White House view, is marriage a civil liberty?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We believe that -- the President believes strongly that LGBT Americans should enjoy the same legal rights, and he opposes efforts to deny rights to LGBT American and discriminate against them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Just another question.\xc2\xa0 It\'s pretty rare when somebody runs for office saying, in effect, I\'m getting ready to change my mind.\xc2\xa0 And you\'ve really savaged Mitt Romney for changing his mind, and I\'m wondering if you don\'t run some risk of looking kind of too clever by half here.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\'t have an update for you on the President\'s personal views.\xc2\xa0 He described them in response to a question.\xc2\xa0 This has gotten a great deal of coverage in the past. That\'s the answer he has and I don\'t have a new answer for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what would you say is the definition of "evolving"? You\'ve said it so many times, it has to mean something specific.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President said that his views on this are evolving.\xc2\xa0 I think --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he getting ready to change?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily.\xc2\xa0 I think he just said they were evolving.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s at a personal level.\xc2\xa0 His views on LGBT rights are crystal-clear and this administration has taken actions that are unparalleled to support those rights.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll continue to take those actions because he thinks that\'s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How could his views be crystal-clear if everybody in this room is needing to ask you questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I think everybody in this room is reacting in the way that folks often do to one story that takes off and then they run down the field and chase it.\xc2\xa0 They\'re reacting to comments on a Sunday show.\xc2\xa0 Nothing has changed in the President\'s firm commitment to LGBT rights and nothing\'s changed and I have no new information --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- position by the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s the same position.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not the position of the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s position is --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why did you guys send out statements to clarify?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the Vice President\'s statements were being misinterpreted by some, so he -- so there was an effort to clarify it by the office of the Vice President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what do you think the word "evolving" means?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that\'s where the President is, okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he unevolved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That means changing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, now I have the ball, let me run with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Policy positions haven\'t changed, Jake.\xc2\xa0 And I can remind you that his support for LGBT rights is unprecedented and compares favorably to anyone else out there in the political arena who\'s advocating for these rights.\xc2\xa0 And he\'ll continue to support them.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, now I\'m going to take the ball and run down the field with it real quick.\xc2\xa0 And I want you to dissect the evolution.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I\'m not going to, April.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I don\'t have anything new for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Okay, you\'re not going to, but can you at least say yea or nay when I kind of try to -- (laughter) -- here\'s the deal.\xc2\xa0 Here\'s the deal.\xc2\xa0 Before we heard that it was\xc2\xa0 -- he was having a hard time marrying issues of his faith and rights.\xc2\xa0 Is that the evolution?\xc2\xa0 Is that where the evolution issue is a holdup?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The next time the President has a news conference, if you want to ask him that you\xe2\x80\x99re certainly welcome to.\xc2\xa0 I do not have an update for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal views.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not finished, I\xe2\x80\x99m not finished.\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, one more question.\xc2\xa0 Going back to what Steve asked about --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, well, let me ask you -- does the President at least want to support a Democrat for that seat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, April, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I have to take that question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you post that answer, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, did the President know before yesterday, did the President know that the Vice President was comfortable with men marrying men?\xc2\xa0 Is this something they\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout for you of conversations they\xe2\x80\x99ve had on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it something they\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout for you of private conversations that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Do I understand correctly that the Russian President has the same invitation for a bilateral before the Camp David summit that the French President has?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made any announcement.\xc2\xa0 The President very much looks forward to meeting with President-elect Putin when he\xe2\x80\x99s here.\xc2\xa0 Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor, as you know, met with President -- well, he\xe2\x80\x99s President Putin now, he\xe2\x80\x99s been sworn in -- President-elect Putin when he was in Moscow, as well as Security Council Secretary Patrushev and Deputy Head of the Government Apparatus Ushakov as part of an ongoing series of high-level consultations on issues of mutual strategic interest.\xc2\xa0 And I think there was a readout by the Russian government on those meetings that Mr. Donilon had.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait, so they could meet here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make on any meetings.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No indication yet of a one-on-one with Putin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New topic?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, new topics, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan -- was it mentioned yesterday in the conversation between the two leaders?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would point you to the readout we gave.\xc2\xa0 I think that contained the topics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And my second point, President Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy were pretty close.\xc2\xa0 They have been elected -- they knew each other even before being elected.\xc2\xa0 Do you read or do you see any lessons in Nicolas Sarkozy\xe2\x80\x99s defeat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll analyze another country\xe2\x80\x99s politics.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that our alliance with France is enduring and will continue to be a vital part of our national security future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since this close alliance, being a European Socialist is such a bad name here, and Francois Hollande is a European Socialist, do you think they can really get close in an election year in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have issues with France that we will work on regardless of who\xe2\x80\x99s President or which government -- which party is in power.\xc2\xa0 And I think that applies to nations across Europe, especially with such allies as close as France is.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there have been very close relations between France and the United States, regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in power here, or regardless of which party is in power in France.\xc2\xa0 And I expect that to continue.</p>\n<p>\n\tJen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Is it still accurate to say, then, that President Obama is opposed to gay marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that his views are evolving, which is what he said.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, were you saying that the Vice President\'s comments were his personal views?\xc2\xa0 Were you looping it together with Arne Duncan\'s views?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President spoke very clearly about the President\'s policies, and they\'re entirely consistent with the policies that this President has supported.\xc2\xa0 He also -- he talked about evolution in this country and other issues, and those were personal views.\xc2\xa0 I will simply refer you to the statement that the office of the Vice President put out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One to finish up -- back on Hollande.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any indication that his position will be any different, and could affect yours, on what to do next in Syria?\xc2\xa0 The United States and France have worked fairly closely together to this point.\xc2\xa0 Does this put greater onus on the United States to help come up with a better or different solution?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he was just elected yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more insight into that except to say that our position on Syria I think is quite clear.\xc2\xa0 We support the Annan plan but are skeptical about the Assad regime\'s willingness to comply with it.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work with the international community and will take steps as necessary if the Annan plan does not succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just want to get back to -- as someone who\'s worked with the Vice President before, do you remember him ever speaking so favorably on the issue of same-sex marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I will simply point you to what the Vice President said yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President supports this President\'s policies in support for LGBT rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he said as progress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this an evolution --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what the Vice President said.</p>\n<p>\n\tLester, you deserve a question after collapsing.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Methodist General Conference representatives of 12 million voted 685 to 246 to reject a proposal to divest from companies who do business with Israel.\xc2\xa0 Is the President grateful for this support of Israel from our third-largest religious denomination?\xc2\xa0 I have one follow-up.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just take the one question.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 The President believes strongly that we have an unshakeable alliance with Israel, and I\'ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:33 P.M.
