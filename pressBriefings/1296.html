EDT \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Thank you for joining us on our trip to Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard. \xc2\xa0For starters, I just wanted to ask, and for folks who read the transcript of this, that the privacy of the First Family is respected. \xc2\xa0And, you know, the girls will obviously be out and about and the First Family will be doing things -- you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s just like last year. \xc2\xa0We appreciate the hospitality of the folks at Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard. \xc2\xa0And the First Family had such a great time, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to a great time again. \xc2\xa0We just hope that the local and national reporters respect the privacy of the girls, especially.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take some questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The economy, the numbers this morning were very bad. \xc2\xa0I know the President has come out and made a statement, but how bad does the White House think this is? \xc2\xa0I mean, is the economy -- did the economy really hit a wall in August, as it looks like? \xc2\xa0Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s a real risk of a double-dip recession?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that there are going to be a lot of indicators that show some movement in different directions, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that we have not done everything that we can to keep moving the economy in the right direction. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why he was out there pushing for the small business bill as soon as the Senate gets back. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some progress but the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with the pace. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s doing everything that we can to get the economy moving at a strength that is going to keep -- that is going to get Americans back to work.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, I mean, how bad do you think the outlook is for the economy? \xc2\xa0I mean, how high would you rate the risks of a double-dip recession?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert economist, but I will say that if you\xe2\x80\x99re an unemployed family right now you\xe2\x80\x99d think that the economy is in pretty bad shape, and those are the kind of folks that the President is out there fighting for every single day to try to create jobs and create a stronger economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did those numbers surprise you -- 500,000 jobs?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0You know, these indicators -- there\xe2\x80\x99s economic indicators that come out every single week and you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they are before they\xe2\x80\x99re announced, so what do you know what the numbers would be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, how effective do you think the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement is going to be, because he\xe2\x80\x99s giving it -- he\xe2\x80\x99s going today, he\xe2\x80\x99s going away for 10 days. \xc2\xa0The Senate isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming back obviously until after the August recess. \xc2\xa0I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of time in between now and when the Senate is actually going to take this up, or when the pressure is really going to need to be on. \xc2\xa0Are we going to hear more from him? \xc2\xa0And how effective is what he did today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President has been trying to -- has been applying pressure on this issue for a while now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s been Republican obstruction that\xe2\x80\x99s stopped it from going forward. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about it out on this trip that we took previously, he talked about it today, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to when he gets back because it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important that we create an environment where these small businesses can create jobs and make America\xe2\x80\x99s economy stronger.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Pew poll came out today and there\xe2\x80\x99s some numbers on there that are interesting -- one showing that the number of Americans who believe that the President is Muslim has gone up, while the number of Americans who believe the President is Christian has gone down. \xc2\xa0What do you guys make of that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you have to understand that for most Americans, they\xe2\x80\x99re not reading a lot in the news about what religion the President is and anything other -- what they\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is, you know, what you guys are focused on, which is important issues like what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the economy, what are we doing to create jobs -- all these different issues.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And so the President is obviously a -- is Christian. \xc2\xa0He prays every day. \xc2\xa0He communicates with his religious advisor every single day. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a group of pastors that he takes counsel from on a regular basis. \xc2\xa0And his faith is very important to him, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that is a topic of conversation every single day.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So why do you think the American public has got these opinions of him that he\xe2\x80\x99s a Muslim and not a Christian?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I just think people are focused on other issues and not paying all that much attention to exactly what the President does with his spirituality. \xc2\xa0But as you all know and have covered extensively, he is Christian and his faith is very important to him.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could the White House have -- could the President speak more about his religion to counter this perception that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t Christian? \xc2\xa0He has talked about his faith in the past. \xc2\xa0Could the White House have him come out and talk about it more?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0He has spoken about his faith extensively in the past. \xc2\xa0You can bet that he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about his faith again. \xc2\xa0You could always play the \xe2\x80\x9cwould-of, could-of, should-of,\xe2\x80\x9d but the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priority here isn\xe2\x80\x99t making sure that Americans know what a devout Christian he is, it\xe2\x80\x99s making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting the economy on track and we\xe2\x80\x99re creating jobs in this country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it frustrating to him though that so many people have this misperception? \xc2\xa0Did he have a reaction to these poll findings, do you know?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to him about it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his reaction was. \xc2\xa0But I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that he is all that focused on some poll like this.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It suggests that the Americans -- the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t really know him. \xc2\xa0I mean, is that something that bothers him?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s extrapolating too much from one poll, one day, and one of its questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any update on the CEA head or the consumer agency head coming out during the vineyard trip? \xc2\xa0Any meetings coming up at the White House with potential heads -- Warren?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update on timing. \xc2\xa0I would say that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything any time soon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Like in the next two weeks or any --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s soon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on any new timing. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be coy about saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s like right around the corner, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the immediate future here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give an idea of who they\xe2\x80\x99re looking at for the CEA?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything new for you on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Iraq last night, can you clarify what happened? \xc2\xa0Was that indeed the last combat brigade brought out of Iraq last night? \xc2\xa0I mean, 50,000 troops is still a considerable amount to have there anyway.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Right, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s significantly more than 50,000 troops still in Iraq. \xc2\xa0And as we move towards the end of the combat mission in Iraq, there are a lot of reporters who are embedded in with units that are leaving Iraq, and more will be leaving over the course of the next couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And the President obviously thinks our nation owes a debt of gratitude to the brave men and women who have served there and have achieved the objectives of the United States. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve decreased violence there. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Iraqi army in a place where they can take care of their own security. \xc2\xa0And politics has broken out all over the country, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what people are using to solve their differences.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So as we get to the end of the mission on August 31st, September 1st we\xe2\x80\x99ll begin a new one. \xc2\xa0There will be a change in command there and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the United States move to a new role, which is advising and assisting the Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There were reports that those were the last troops. \xc2\xa0Were those incorrect last night?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0There are more troops that will be leaving Iraq over the course of the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So were they wrong in reporting the last combat brigade was leaving the country?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think that you should talk to the Pentagon about the specific troop movements and who is where. \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I saw every report that was out there on this. \xc2\xa0But I can tell you that there are more troops that are going to be leaving the country over the -- leaving Iraq over the course of the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I change -- stay with foreign affairs?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s some talk that there may be movement on the Middle East peace talks. \xc2\xa0Is there a possibility that during the course of the Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard holiday, there may be some news from the White House on progress to direct talks between the Palestinians and the Israelis? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I saw those reports, and as you all know and have covered, George Mitchell, Secretary Clinton and the President have all been working very hard to make progress and get to a place where there are direct talks. \xc2\xa0I don\'t have anything to announce for you on that. \xc2\xa0If there\xe2\x80\x99s any change, then I will let you know as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any update on Pakistan aid?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I went through this yesterday quite a bit. \xc2\xa0Today Secretary Clinton and the USAID administrator Rajiv Shah are at the United Nations, talking about what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing, what else can be done to help the people of Pakistan. \xc2\xa0This is an ongoing crisis and we don\'t know exactly -- hold on one second -- what we can do to help them mitigate some of the problems that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing as a result of these floods and the rains.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve already given tens of millions in assistance. \xc2\xa0American helicopters and C-130 planes are helping in the effort. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve delivered hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and medical supplies, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to help as requests come in through the Pakistani government.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, could you say something about what the appeal is that Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard has for the President -- like what is so great about it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful part of the country. \xc2\xa0It has really nice beaches and the folks are really great. \xc2\xa0The food is terrific. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s some place that the President went before he was President and likes to go back because it\xe2\x80\x99s a comfortable place where he can rest and recharge the batteries a little bit.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you talk a little bit about his workload? \xc2\xa0I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99ll get his daily briefings, but anything else scheduled?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to get his intelligence briefings, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll also be getting briefings on the economy and other issues as they come up. \xc2\xa0But as any of you guys who have covered these vacations before know, there\xe2\x80\x99s other things that come up and he\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously attend to those as necessary.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s he reading?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Still don\'t have that for you. \xc2\xa0I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m going to jump back to one another topic, and that is, does the President think that the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmosque\xe2\x80\x9d in the whole controversy down there near 9/11, is it being reported fairly, is it being treated fairly, or is -- or are people overplaying the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmosque\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him say that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Okay, thanks for the good times.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 END \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 1:38 P.M.
