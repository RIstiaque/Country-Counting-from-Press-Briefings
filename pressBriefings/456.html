Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:00 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Everybody seems deep in thought today.\xc2\xa0 Got a couple of things I want to do here at the top before we get started, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe first is on a topic that you may not have previously been following but I wanted to raise with this group.\xc2\xa0 Right now there are 48 nominees for ambassador that are pending, and 26 who are waiting on the floor and eligible for confirmation by the full Senate.\xc2\xa0 The majority of those who are waiting are career Foreign Service officers.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese nominees have been waiting an average of 262 days, and these delays are simply unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s time Republicans in the Senate ended their obstruction and allowed these qualified individuals to do their important work protecting American interests around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn fact, there are currently 70 -- seven-zero -- nominees to positions impacting our national security, including officials at the Department of Defense, the State Department and other foreign-focused agencies pending in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, because of partisan delays by Senate Republicans, these qualified nominees to critical national security posts have been forced to put their lives on hold and wait indefinitely to be confirmed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe urge Republicans in the Senate to stop playing political games and let these individuals get to work on behalf of the American people.\xc2\xa0 Fielding a full team abroad is not a partisan priority, it\xe2\x80\x99s an American necessity.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the second piece of news that I have this afternoon is that earlier this morning, the President placed a telephone call to Prime Minister David Cameron.\xc2\xa0 The two leaders consulted principally on the current situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 They also had a brief discussion about the situation in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout of that telephone call later this afternoon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that business out of the way, Darlene, do you want get us started?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Couple of questions on Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 The Russian President said today that the ceasefire there should be extended, coupled with talks between the government and the rebels.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering if the administration sees that as -- sees Putin as being genuine when he says that, or is this another situation where you see his words and actions there to be -- a disconnect between what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying and what he does?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 We do, as we have in the past, welcome any Russian steps to end the crisis in Ukraine, including President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s request to the Duma to revoke a resolution authorizing the use of Russian military forces in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We also welcome the separatists\xe2\x80\x99 acceptance of the ceasefire and call on them to abide by it.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are supportive of any comments from President Putin about the value of a ceasefire agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat said, in the coming days, it\xe2\x80\x99s words, not just actions\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- it\xe2\x80\x99s actions, not just words, that will be critical.\xc2\xa0 And this is what the President conveyed to President Putin in their telephone call yesterday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States remains concerned about the continued presence of Russian forces along the border and prepositioned heavy weaponry that we believe is intended for separatists.\xc2\xa0 Moving these forces away from the border, ceasing support for separatists, and calling on separatists to continue to abide by the ceasefire and disarm would send a clear signal that Russia is interested in a diplomatic settlement resulting in stability in eastern Ukraine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, there is an opportunity for President Putin and Russia to play a constructive role in de-escalating the situation in the eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And the constructive role that they can play involves more than just words, it involves tangible actions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for President Putin to take these actions and support the de-escalation of the crisis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if he takes these actions, and if the rebels do enter into talks with the Ukrainian government, does the administration still see the need for additional sanctions against Russia?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the goal of sanctions was to accomplish a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is to further isolate the Russians and to put pressure on them to take the kind of action that would be conducive to de-escalating tensions in the neighboring country of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, if we started to see a change in the behavior of the Russian government and we saw some concrete steps along the lines that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been calling for, for some time -- ending support for the separatists, making sure that materiel and weapons wasn\xe2\x80\x99t being provided to the separatists -- that that would be a positive development and it would make additional sanctions less likely.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused here on is not just the words of the Russian President, though we welcome them; what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on are the actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, to follow up on yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s question about the Ex-Im Bank, the Wall Street Journal reported about some potential corruption there.\xc2\xa0 Is that something the White House is looking into and concerned about?\xc2\xa0 And how are you advocating for this on the Hill with that now in the background?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is I know that the Export-Import Bank has issued a statement saying that they have zero tolerance for waste, fraud and abuse.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that the President of the United States has zero tolerance for waste, fraud and abuse.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Ex-Im Bank is working with the inspector general, and they take very seriously reports like these.\xc2\xa0 For additional information about the status of that investigation or for any steps they may be taking over at Ex-Im, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the press office over there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the Ex-Im Bank\xe2\x80\x99s overall mission, however, I think the numbers speak for themselves -- that what we see at the Export-Import Bank is a tangible and important contribution to the U.S. economy.\xc2\xa0 The President has spent a lot of time over the course of this year talking about expanding economic opportunity being the focal point of his domestic policy agenda.\xc2\xa0 And the efforts of the folks at the Export-Import Bank to support American businesses as they seek to expand their businesses overseas is important.\xc2\xa0 It makes a tangible contribution to our economy.\xc2\xa0 It makes a tangible contribution to job creation.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOver the last five years, the bank has supported 1.2 million jobs in the United States across a range of sectors, including 200,000 jobs last year alone.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also important support provided by the Ex-Im Bank to American small businesses -- about 3,400 American small business transactions were supported by the Ex-Im Bank in 2013.\xc2\xa0 So expanding and strengthening the U.S. economy is a top priority of the President\xe2\x80\x99s, and he does not think that it would be a smart policy decision to start withdrawing support from those institutions that play such an important role in supporting our economy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out that President Reagan had some similar comments, had a similar view to this President back in 1986, when he signed legislation extending the life of the Ex-Im Bank.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d also point out that there are a couple of other individuals who are not well known as Obama supporters, who have articulated their strong support for the mission of the Ex-Im Bank and have encouraged Congress to take bipartisan action to reauthorize it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me just read a short quote here from Tom Donohue, who is the President and CEO of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and Jay Timmons, who\xe2\x80\x99s the President and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.\xc2\xa0 They said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Ex-Im is not reauthorized, products of all shapes and sizes, from planes to medical equipment, will still be purchased overseas.\xc2\xa0 They just will not be produced in the U.S. [and not] by American workers.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the stakes here are pretty high.\xc2\xa0 There is bipartisan agreement that there is a tangible contribution that Ex-Im is making to the American economy and to American job creation.\xc2\xa0 And there is bipartisan agreement that it needs to be reauthorized.\xc2\xa0 And we are hopeful that Congress will do what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done many times in the past, and that is support the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank in bipartisan fashion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does it make it harder to press for that when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got reports about fraud?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the short answer to that is no -- simply because, as I mentioned earlier, the numbers speak for themselves.\xc2\xa0 The tangible impact that the Ex-Im Bank has on our economy and job creation is reason enough for Congress to act in bipartisan fashion, again, as they have many times, to reauthorize the bank.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And one other topic.\xc2\xa0 Senior White House and administration officials are meeting tomorrow with Tom Steyer, among others, about a climate change report.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any misgivings about bringing in a very top and influential political donor to the White House?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that the Keystone pipeline will come up during those conversations?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no misgivings about the individuals who are participating in that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Their political activities notwithstanding, the administration is committed to making progress in addressing the causes of climate change and reducing carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that Mr. Steyer has obviously well-known views on, but there are a lot of other people with well-known views on this that the White House is consulting.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d point out that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not worth billions of dollars, though, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a number of insurance executives who are here to talk to White House staff today about this very topic.\xc2\xa0 I would anticipate that many of them -- although I don\xe2\x80\x99t know this personally -- I would assume that many of them have a pretty active political interest, and I would assume that many of their political interests may not align perfectly with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the point is we\xe2\x80\x99re talking to people from a variety of political perspectives.\xc2\xa0 I think the thing that they have in common is they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned that failure to address the causes of climate change and the failure to take tangible steps to reduce carbon pollution would have a terrible impact on our country and a terrible impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 Again, that is something that is -- that is a view that\xe2\x80\x99s held by Democrats and Republicans alike, and this administration is willing to work with Democrats and Republicans alike to try to make progress on those goals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s move around the room a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Following on climate change, though, yesterday the Supreme Court dealt the EPA a setback on regulations.\xc2\xa0 What new actions is this administration proposing or thinking about in terms of climate change?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I agree with that analysis.\xc2\xa0 And I think that Chief Justice -- not Chief Justice -- I just gave him a promotion -- Justice Scalia articulated this a little bit differently.\xc2\xa0 I had the quote in my book here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But he basically made the point that over the course of the case the EPA was sort of discussing their authority to regulate -- 86 percent of their regulatory authority was in question before the Court, and 83 percent of that regulatory authority was upheld by the Court.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we actually see this as a pretty good ratification of the authority that\xe2\x80\x99s vested in the EPA to take the kinds of commonsense steps that are clearly in the best interest of our country and that are clearly in the best interest of our economy.\xc2\xa0 The President has talked about this at length.\xc2\xa0 And I think because he has identified this as a priority for his second term, you can anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to be pushing members of his administration to take the necessary action to prepare our country for the consequences of climate change.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt is the view of this administration, and certainly the view of the President, that that can be done in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s actually good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99d be doing is focusing on those areas where we can both make our country more resilient, where we can reduce carbon pollution, but also strengthen our economy and look for opportunities to capitalize on growth industries.\xc2\xa0 There are countries around the globe that are going to be grappling with the effects of climate change, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for our country to play a leading role in terms of capitalizing on new industries related to improved efficiency, but also related to renewable energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tStephen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President ask President Putin yesterday to seek this revocation of the Duma\xe2\x80\x99s authority to go to Ukraine as part of the steps he wants to see for the situation to be de-escalated?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer you a more specific readout of that telephone conversation than you\xe2\x80\x99ve already seen.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid I think over the last several weeks about the concrete steps that we would like to see President Putin take to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe welcome the step that was taken as it relates to the Duma today.\xc2\xa0 But there are some additional concrete steps that we would like to see them take as it relates to pulling forces from the border, moving some of that heavy weaponry away so that it can\xe2\x80\x99t be transferred into the hands of separatists.\xc2\xa0 There are some tangible steps -- and while we welcome those words and those symbolic measures that are taken, what we\xe2\x80\x99re most focused on right now are concrete steps that Russia can take to support the ceasefire agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The State Department yesterday said there were some tanks that appear to be getting ready to be moved across the border into eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Today, there was a helicopter shot down by rebels, killing a number of Ukrainian soldiers.\xc2\xa0 Does that sort of indicate to the White House that perhaps this may be more window dressing than actual progress?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is why we are reserving judgment and trying to make clear that the proper way to evaluate the posture that\xe2\x80\x99s adopted by President Putin is to closely examine the actions that are taken by the Russians and the Russian military.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe welcome the positive words, but what\xe2\x80\x99s critical right now are the actions that are taken by the Russian government to de-escalate the situation.\xc2\xa0 And that involves moving some of that heavy weaponry that you\xe2\x80\x99ve referenced, Stephen, and making sure that some of that materiel is not transferred into the hands of separatists so that they can perpetrate additional violence like shooting down helicopters.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Viqueira.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Earnest.\xc2\xa0 When Secretary Kerry was recently in Cairo, he indicated nothing to worry about -- the Apache helicopters that the Egyptians want, they\xe2\x80\x99re on the way.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has certified that Egypt is moving towards democracy, freeing up some $570 million in aid that was held in advance.\xc2\xa0 The $1.5 billion that they get every year appears to be going forward.\xc2\xa0 What leverage -- is it all\xe2\x80\x99s well that ends well with Egypt?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what leverage does the administration have when they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to -- when you are trying to move Egypt towards, for example, freeing jailed journalists and other impingements on democracy within Egypt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one aspect of your question that I do want to clarify for you, though.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen we announced earlier this year the resumption of some assistance to Egypt, it was predicated on the certification of two things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that Egypt was sustaining their strategic relationship with the United States, and that Egypt was fulfilling the obligations under the treaty that Egypt has with Israel.\xc2\xa0 And by certifying those two things, that allowed assistance to be reinstated to a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 The first is -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s about $572 million in assistance.\xc2\xa0 Those are directed toward two things.\xc2\xa0 One is support that benefits directly the Egyptian people.\xc2\xa0 So these are humanitarian items like health and education support, and private-sector development.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe second area of support that that reinstated was security assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the United States core national security interest.\xc2\xa0 So this included assistance to the Egyptian military to assist them in securing Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s borders, supporting ongoing counterterrorism and anti-proliferation efforts, and helping them to ensure security more broadly in the Sinai Peninsula.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s left of the whole deck?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good question.\xc2\xa0 There is additional assistance that remains on hold because Egypt has yet to meet the requirements for reinstatement, including taking steps to ensure a democratic transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in your question you noted that Secretary Kerry had certified, according to congressional requirements, that Egypt had met the standard as it relates to fulfilling basic principles of democracy.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary has not certified to that standard, and that is why there is some assistance that has been withheld.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the question then is, what would we like to see the Egyptian government do.\xc2\xa0 And, quite frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s directly related to those principles of democracy that we referred to earlier.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, recent developments indicate that Egypt has not taken the kinds of steps that we would like to see toward adopting widely accepted principles of respect for basic human rights and other democratic principles that we hold dear in this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut as we continue to evaluate the ongoing situation in Egypt and what impact that should have on the assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s provided to Egypt, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to consult closely with Congress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJustin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you brought up ambassadors, I just wanted to get you to respond to the charge that\xe2\x80\x99s come from Capitol Hill that the reason there\xe2\x80\x99s been delays has been that the administration has kind of forwarded political donors as nominees at a pace that exceeds both the Clinton and Bush administrations.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen kind of lackluster performances by people like the ambassador nominee to Norway, George Tsunis, that people like Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken have asked you guys to pull back.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- you kind of blame Republican obstructionism.\xc2\xa0 The rebuttal is, of course, that you\xe2\x80\x99re sending up unqualified political nominees, and how you kind of grapple with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say several things about that.\xc2\xa0 First of all, of the 26 who are pending on the Senate floor right now, 16 of them are career Foreign Service officers.\xc2\xa0 So the objections that you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised don\xe2\x80\x99t explain their obstruction to those 16 career Foreign Service officers.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the other nominees that the President has appointed to these positions, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got full confidence in their ability to do these jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think it is short-sighted to automatically rule out nominees that aren\xe2\x80\x99t career Foreign Service officers.\xc2\xa0 If that were the case, that means that Caroline Kennedy would not be serving as the ambassador to Japan.\xc2\xa0 I think most people, even some Republicans, would agree that she\xe2\x80\x99s doing a pretty good job over there.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President has also appointed people like Jon Huntsman, the former Republican Governor of Utah, to an important ambassador post in China.\xc2\xa0 Again, he is not a career Foreign Service officer.\xc2\xa0 But, again, Democrats and Republicans would agree that he did an able job of representing our country\xe2\x80\x99s interests in China.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tZeke.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 In 2011, when the President said that the U.S. was leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, was his assessment wrong at the time of what the situation was on the ground, or was he perhaps sugarcoating the situation on the ground because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to leave that residual force?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s happened over the course of the last three years is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the circumstances on the ground change; that so much of the sacrifice that was made principally by American servicemen and women in uniform was to create an opportunity for the Iraqi people to seize a democratic future.\xc2\xa0 And what we have seen is leadership, political leadership in Iraq that has not done a very good job of capitalizing on that opportunity and unifying that country around an inclusive governing agenda.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve spent a lot of time over the last couple of years urging Prime Minister Maliki and other political leaders in Iraq to pursue a more inclusive agenda.\xc2\xa0 To confront the existential threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL, the nation of Iraq needs to be unified.\xc2\xa0 And there needs to be a sense among every citizen in Iraq -- including those in the Shia community and the Sunni community and the Kurd community -- feeling of an investment in the success and stability of that country that the responsibility for unifying that country starts at the top.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why this administration will continue to support political leaders in Iraq who are seeking to build an inclusive political agenda in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With regards to those comments, would the President like to revise or extend them?\xc2\xa0 I mean, was he wrong about the stability of that country if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t last even two and a half years, or if these political problems existed even a couple years ago?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Zeke, I think that anybody who has been looking at this situation would acknowledge that the circumstances on the ground have changed, and the necessary steps that are required by the Iraqi political leadership have not been taken to confront those changes.\xc2\xa0 And that poses a very severe challenge to the nation of Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require all of the political leaders of the various communities of Iraq coming together, putting the interest of that unified country first to confront that threat.\xc2\xa0 It is still an open question about whether or not the political leadership of that country is going to choose that path.\xc2\xa0 But the future of a unified Iraq depends upon it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to follow up on Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question yesterday -- is it acceptable for the Obama administration, for any sort of partition to be at the outcome of this reconciliation process, if there is one politically, or even if it is the White House insisting on a unified Iraq as the outcome here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is clearly the policy of this administration and this country that a unified Iraq is the one that is in the best position to confront this existential threat from ISIL.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the alternative acceptable?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this will have to be a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the Iraqi people, but it is the clear policy of this country that we feel like the best way to confront this threat is through a unified Iraq.\xc2\xa0 That is going to require an investment in a political agenda that gives every Iraqi a stake in that country\xe2\x80\x99s future and that country\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also going to require an investment in security forces that reflects that diversity of the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, that security force will be stronger if it reflects the diversity of the country -- again, because if the security force is put in place to defend the security of everybody in that country, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to need a security force that\xe2\x80\x99s composed of individuals from the various communities of that country.\xc2\xa0 And so those are the kinds of investments that this administration has been pushing Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to invoke.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Kerry said this morning that to have a U.S. aircraft bomb in Iraq before the formation of a new government would be completely wasted.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, he said that the administration would not have to wait for a new government in order to strike.\xc2\xa0 What has changed?\xc2\xa0 Is it now a precondition of U.S. help from the air that there be a new Iraqi government?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there was a -- the context in which he made those comments was important.\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Kerry was talking about is something that I referred to yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Somebody asked if the President was willing to sort of keep open the option on the table to consider military action in Syria to confront the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 What this President has made clear is a willingness to act unilaterally anywhere in the world to protect our national security interests.\xc2\xa0 That is something that is true in places like Yemen, in Somalia, even in --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically about Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But even most recently in Libya.\xc2\xa0 So when it comes to protecting our core national security interests, the President is willing to use the strongest, most powerful military in the history of the world to protect our national security interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, separately is a different question, which is a question that\xe2\x80\x99s related to -- is the President willing to use American military might to stabilize the security situation in Iraq to provide a little room for the Iraqi political leadership to get their act together?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about, and what the President himself was very clear about when he spoke in front of the helicopter 10 days ago was that to take any sort of direct military action along those lines in pursuit of that goal, we would need to see a clear commitment from Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leaders to the pursuit of an inclusive governing agenda.\xc2\xa0 Because again --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean it has to be a newcomer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because, again, the success of this situation, the successful confrontation of the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL will require a unified Iraq, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require a government that is pursuing an inclusive governing agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re basically saying that what Secretary Kerry said this morning is correct -- that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be U.S. airstrikes before there\xe2\x80\x99s a new government in Iraq.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the President, when he talked about this 10 days ago, was very clear about what criteria he will use in making decisions about the use of our military to protect our national security interests and to support efforts to form and build an inclusive Iraqi government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not endorsing what Secretary Kerry said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do is be very clear about what our position is and what the policy as articulated by the President is.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that Secretary -- in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s comments don\xe2\x80\x99t differ from that at all.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to briefly follow up on Zeke\xe2\x80\x99s question about the comments in 2011, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to focus on what the President said just this past November when Maliki was here.\xc2\xa0 In the Oval Office, the President praised Maliki for taking steps in this commitment to \xe2\x80\x9censuring a strong, prosperous, inclusive and democratic Iraq,\xe2\x80\x9d and spoke about how he had done much to bring together the Sunnis, the Kurdish and Shia.\xc2\xa0 Did the President misjudge Maliki?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that was not -- this was just November.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at the exact comments from the President at that time.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal in those comments was to encourage the pursuit of a governing agenda that reflects the diversity of the country.\xc2\xa0 That was the goal of the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments when they were sitting in the Oval Office, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal of the comments expressed by other senior administration officials in terms of encouraging Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political leadership to pursue the kind of agenda and governing style that reflects the diversity of that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask you -- again, just to follow up on questions you had last week about the flow of children coming over the border with Mexico.\xc2\xa0 You were asked, and a number of other officials across the administration have been asked, how many of those that have been caught have been released with a promise to appeal -- you know, appear back in court?\xc2\xa0 And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that number then; I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering do you have that number now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that number in front of me, Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why don\xe2\x80\x99t you have that number?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been asked everywhere. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a number the administration has, right?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have it, it\xe2\x80\x99s that you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to release it, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have it actually, Jon.\xc2\xa0 DHS may have it.\xc2\xa0 But let me just stipulate something:\xc2\xa0 Without knowing what that number is and without having seen it, I think we can all stipulate that that number is too high.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have seen an investment -- a surge, in fact -- of resources by this administration to try to address what is a large and growing problem along our southern border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s why the -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an investment of additional judges and asylum officers and ICE attorneys deployed to try to more efficiently and rapidly process these cases.\xc2\xa0 And where necessary, we\xe2\x80\x99re opening up additional facilities where adults and adults that are traveling with children can be detained.\xc2\xa0 In conjunction with the opening of those detention facilities are, again, additional ICE officers and immigration judges who can process these cases quickly, so that if it is determined that these individuals should be removed, that they will be removed promptly as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the interest of transparency, can you get that number for us?\xc2\xa0 People have been asking for quite some time.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I understand -- I think your interest in this is understandable.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the numbers, but I will stipulate that the number is larger than any of us in this room would like to see.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is dealing with what is a number that is too big.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the reason for the flow, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz said that it was increasing violence in Central America.\xc2\xa0 But today, Jeh Johnson was asked if there had been any measurable increase in violence in Central America in the last two years, and he said he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say there was.\xc2\xa0 So are you still saying that that is the reason?\xc2\xa0 Or is the reason, as you had suggested last week, what you called a \xe2\x80\x9cdisinformation campaign\xe2\x80\x9d by smugglers who say that they can -- the children are fine, once they get here they have permission to be here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99d make the case to you that those things aren\xe2\x80\x99t mutually exclusive; that there are a lot of people who are trapped in terrible violent situations in Central America, and therefore are a little desperate to try to get out of that situation, or desperate about the safety of their children.\xc2\xa0 And so it makes them easy targets for criminal syndicates and other individuals with bad intentions to propagate misinformation that gives them false hope about what kind of sanctuary they can receive in the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe fact of the matter is, people who appear at the southern border expecting to be taken in are mistaken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they mistaken?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not U.S. policy to send these children back, is it?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re deporting these children, unaccompanied children back to Central America?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The policy is complicated.\xc2\xa0 If the children are from Mexico, yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what happens.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Central America, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking, is most of this flow, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly some of the flow, but you asked me about children who show up at the southern border unaccompanied.\xc2\xa0 Yes, some of them are immediately returned.\xc2\xa0 Others are detained and returned.\xc2\xa0 So they go through the immigration process just like everyone else.\xc2\xa0 But there are professional accommodations that are required when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about children who show up at the southern border without an adult, without a parent nearby.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is a process that we put in place.\xc2\xa0 FEMA is coordinating the response to this effort to make sure that resources that are marshalled from DHS and HHS are in place to handle the situation, what at its root is a humanitarian situation, but also in a way that is in strict compliance with the law.\xc2\xa0 This administration has demonstrated its commitment to enforcing the law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that number of how many have been deported back to Central America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do not have that number.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would stipulate that that number as well is higher than we would like to see, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing sort of a stepped-up deployment of resources to deal with it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to jump to the IRS.\xc2\xa0 The Commissioner, John Koskinen, he\xe2\x80\x99s been testifying up on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 And one thing that he testified I wanted to ask you about.\xc2\xa0 He said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the lost emails of Lois Lerner until April.\xc2\xa0 But then, of course, the IRS did not inform Congress until June.\xc2\xa0 Is that an acceptable level of transparency, do you think -- two months that the Commissioner of the IRS knew about these lost emails, but yet Congress wasn\xe2\x80\x99t told until June?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for that timeline, so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to direct that question to the IRS.\xc2\xa0 I guess the one thing that does seem obvious --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking is whether that is acceptable to this White House, for two months to go by.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a question that\xe2\x80\x99s begged though by your construction, which is what would Congress have done had they known about it in April or May or whenever the Commissioner first learned about it.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not anything that is tangibly different about this situation right now.\xc2\xa0 So this administration --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s no harm in releasing the information, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that information passed along?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well again, Jim, as I mentioned, you should check with the IRS about this.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is our commitment to cooperating with legitimate congressional oversight -- and in some cases, illegitimate congressional oversight -- is pretty well documented.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through it again, because it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty entertaining.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying Darrell Issa\xe2\x80\x99s oversight is illegitimate here?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that there are legitimate questions that can be raised about the partisan motivation of some of those who are conducting oversight in this circumstance.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is there have been 17 congressional hearings into this matter -- two in the last 17 hours and three in the last 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99ve had as many congressional investigations into this in the last 24 hours as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had meals.\xc2\xa0 That seems like a lot.\xc2\xa0 Thirty interviews with IRS employees, 50 written congressional requests, 750,000 pages of documents.\xc2\xa0 After all of that, after three long congressional hearings in the last 24 hours, zero -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the other key number here, zero -- zero evidence to substantiate any of the partisan Republican claims about this matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The problem here though, Josh, is that you have a key figure in this controversy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you and I might have different ideas about what the problem is.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the problem is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because I think the problem is that despite all of this, we have seen an unwillingness --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sound like the dog ate my homework?\xc2\xa0 When you have two years of missing emails, it just -- on the face of it, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound credible.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess if you listen solely to the arguments that are offered up by Republicans, you might have reason to question their credibility.\xc2\xa0 I agree with that.\xc2\xa0 Because the fact of the matter is that, despite the failure of the hard drive, as has been well-chronicled, the fact of the matter is 24,000 emails from that time period have been reconstructed and produced to Congress, again, because of our commitment to cooperating with congressional oversight in this matter.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, again, I understand why your eyebrows are raised when you see Republicans on Capitol Hill suggesting that there are two years of missing emails.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not true.\xc2\xa0 A large chunk of those emails have already been provided to Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 So when they say that, it is an indication I think that they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming increasingly desperate to try to substantiate the conspiracy theories that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been propagating for some time now.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut again, the key number here is zero -- zero evidence to support the claims that are made by Republicans in this matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the President is comfortable with the level of disclosure and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, for all the reasons that I cited -- 13 months of congressional hearings, 17 including three in the last 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 I think that our record of cooperation on this is probably something you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of hearing about right now.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s so long --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking the question -- but the White House is also comfortable with the people at TIGTA looking into the missing emails?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think TIGTA is the inspector general and they\xe2\x80\x99re independent.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t render a judgment on their activities, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be appropriate for me to.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re independent.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMr. Nakamura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Jon\xe2\x80\x99s questions about immigration.\xc2\xa0 The Associated Press today reported that the Homeland Security Department and the White House have -- and I quote from the story -- so far dodged the answer to the question about how many minors have received notices to appear and actually showed up, and \xe2\x80\x9cso far dodged the answer on at least seven occasions over two weeks, alternately saying they did not know the figure or did not have it immediately at hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The Associated Press concludes from that in this story, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is how it looks when the image-conscious Obama administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to reveal politically sensitive information that could influence an important policy debate.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How would you respond to that?\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate, that you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned those numbers would inflame the situation at a time you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get immigration reform going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would indicate, David, is that we would stipulate to the fact that the numbers that you\xe2\x80\x99re seeking are higher than anyone would like them to be.\xc2\xa0 And so the real question for this administration, and I think before the American people when they consider the reaction of their government, is what are they doing about numbers that are bigger than they should be?\xc2\xa0 And in this case, we have taken a number of steps to surge resources to try to address this problem, both in a way that reflects the humanitarian situation that is having a negative effect on some otherwise innocent children, but also in a way that reflects our nation\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to being a nations of laws.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis administration is committed to enforcing the law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the steps taken that we have.\xc2\xa0 I think the one additional thing here that\xe2\x80\x99s also important to recognize is we\xe2\x80\x99re also taking some additional steps to try to address this problem at its root.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President took a trip to Central America and met with leaders of Central American countries just last week to make sure that those countries, the leaders of those countries were doing the things that were required of them to safeguard their population.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe Vice President also announced on that trip some additional steps that the United States could take to support those countries as they try to reduce the violence and address other measures related to citizen security, but also to make sure that people are aware of the facts.\xc2\xa0 And that fact is that showing up unannounced at the southern border with the United States will not gain you legal entry into this country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just follow up on one thing.\xc2\xa0 It looks like Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office has announced a working group of seven Republicans to inform, what he says, inform House leadership about this situation on the border because \xe2\x80\x9cthe President has failed to take the necessary steps to address the crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that an appropriate response by House Republicans because the White House would like to seem real engaged in this?\xc2\xa0 Or do you worry that this kind of working group with seven Republicans would potentially complicate U.S. response by politicizing it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where that announcement was made.\xc2\xa0 Your mention of it is the first I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of it, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass judgment on it from here without having reviewed it more carefully.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIf there are Republicans who do want to play a constructive role in addressing what is a complicated and difficult policy challenge, we certainly would welcome their constructive contributions to those efforts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChristi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On the review that Jeh Johnson was doing before the delay that the President requested, is he continuing -- was it his plan to continue doing that review over the summer?\xc2\xa0 And if so, has this gotten -- has this interrupted the review that he was doing of humane practices and deportation roles?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that that review is still ongoing, but I would encourage you to check with the Department of Homeland Security for an update.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to provide you with one, but they\xe2\x80\x99d be in a better position to do so than I am.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you also say if the White House has seen any signs that Republicans are using the window of opportunity that the President was hoping they would do -- would maybe do this summer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sadly, no.\xc2\xa0 Alexis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to Bill\xe2\x80\x99s question just to clarify on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the trigger -- what would trigger potential air strikes -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand the President when he was speaking to say that he was segregating the two things -- a long-term, more inclusive government and the potential to try to deal with the crisis with air strikes.\xc2\xa0 So can I just clarify -- is the President saying that he would not use them under any circumstances unless the Iraqi government moves forward and shows some signs?\xc2\xa0 Or would he use them to defend Baghdad or to defend the embassy?\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my understanding that that\xe2\x80\x99s what he was trying to convey.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to sort of prejudge what he may or may not conclude.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you to go back and take a look at his comments that he delivered, I guess it was a week ago Friday.\xc2\xa0 I think that he was pretty clear in suggesting that there is not going to be a military solution to the instability that we see in Iraq right now.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s going to be required is a political solution that unites the country to face a threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And what may assist that effort is military support from the United States that would stabilize the security situation and give that government a little bit more room to act and unify the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what the President I think was pretty clear about is his view that because political action will be required in terms of unifying the country, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to see a commitment along those lines before a decision is made about direct military action or other increases in our support for that government.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it too much to say it\xe2\x80\x99s conditional -- the President has conveyed to the Iraq government it\xe2\x80\x99s conditional because they have obviously made a formal request for military intervention, air strikes?\xc2\xa0 Is that going too far to say that the President has conveyed to them it\xe2\x80\x99s conditional?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to read out any sort of detail -- in a detailed manner any private conversations that this administration has had with our counterparts in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 But again, I would encourage you to take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks from a week ago Friday, and I think he was pretty specific about what he had in mind.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, you mentioned the stepped-up deployment of resources to the border.\xc2\xa0 Could that at any point include National Guard troops, as some of the Republicans have been calling for, including in today\xe2\x80\x99s hearing with Secretary Johnson?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If I said that, I may have been a little imprecise.\xc2\xa0 I think what I was trying to suggest is that resources had been mobilized to deal with the problem at the border.\xc2\xa0 In some cases, these detention centers are being opened up in other communities a little bit away from the border, but they\xe2\x80\x99re all rooted in trying to deal with the problem at the border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are the prospects for the National Guard becoming involved in this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has made a historic commitment to deploying resources to secure our border.\xc2\xa0 That is both in the form of technology and in the form of personnel.\xc2\xa0 And I think one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s particularly ironic among some Republicans on Capitol Hill who are suggesting that additional resources should be deployed to the border -- in many cases, those are the same congressional Republicans who are blocking commonsense immigration reform legislation passed by the Senate that -- wait for it -- included a historic commitment of resources to the United States border.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo if we really wanted to solve this problem, one good way to do it would be for those Republicans to get on board and do what so many Republicans did in the United States Senate, which is support commonsense immigration reform that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just secure our border, but would actually do good things for our economy, would reduce the deficit, and finally deal with an immigration system that everyone agrees is broken.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re ruling out the use of the National Guard in this immediate crisis?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is that there has already been a historic commitment of resources to the border, and if there are Republicans in Congress who are focused on increasing resources along the border, that they should jump on board the bandwagon and support the passage of comprehensive immigration reform.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 According to a video that the White House has posted online, the President is going to travel around this summer and start visiting some of the people who have written him.\xc2\xa0 Is this because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think he really understands what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Or is he just going a little stir crazy in his last couple of years in Washington?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ann, one of the things -- I think somebody asked me -- Tamara, I think you may have asked me a little bit about this yesterday --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I might have.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- as I recall.\xc2\xa0 One of the things that the President believes is important is making sure that he is paying careful attention to the way that people all across the country are dealing with so many of the challenges that are facing working families right now.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that the White House hosted the first-ever Working Families Summit here in Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the President is also interested in getting outside of Washington, D.C. and spending time with Americans in their day-to-day routines, and talking to them about the challenges that are confronting their family, their small business or their communities more broadly.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so this is one way for the President to break out of that presidential bubble that so many other Presidents have talked about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to go to their homes?\xc2\xa0 Go with them to the office?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s something that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-time thing?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to do this repeatedly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to spend time walking in the shoes of average Americans will take some different forms.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn the case of the Minnesota trip here, though, I think there is some -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see, I thought I had some more information -- he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do a town hall meeting, and he\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend some time meeting with Rebecca\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xc2\xa0 Rebecca is the woman from Minnesota who had written the President that letter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this will be an opportunity for him to talk to Rebecca, to talk to her family, to talk to people in her community about the range of challenges that they\xe2\x80\x99re facing.\xc2\xa0 And this will hopefully be an opportunity for the President to get some additional insight into the challenges that those families are confronting on a regular basis, but also get some insight into how those families are benefitting from some of the policies, or would benefit from some of the policies that the President and his administration have proposed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jared.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, talking about the diplomatic note -- I mean, assurances that the President got from the Iraqi government, is the bar for assurance lower because the United States government is unsure what state the Iraqi government might be in if and when they ever need to prosecute American troops?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me pull this up here.\xc2\xa0 Jared, the President has made clear that we need to address the status of any military personnel sent into Iraq in response to the Iraqi government\xe2\x80\x99s request for assistance to address the crisis.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo Iraq has provided the exchange of acceptable assurances on the issue of protections for these personnel via the exchange of diplomatic note.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, Iraq has committed itself to providing protections for our personnel equivalent to those provided to personnel who were in the country before the crisis.\xc2\xa0 And we believe, the President believes that those protections are adequate to the short-term assessment and adviser mission that our troops will be performing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact that there\'s a lower bar is only because of the size and scope of the mission?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now is a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s different in character and in kind than we saw in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And those differences are that we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with a rather urgent situation when it comes to the threat that\xe2\x80\x99s posed by ISIL.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe number of military personnel that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about is on a much smaller scale.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a small number of advisers that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a clear request from the Iraqi government, and as a result of that dynamic, those three things -- the emergency situation, the small number of advisers and the request from the Iraqi government -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve received the appropriate assurances from them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about responses to the emergency, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Secretary Kerry there, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen other reaching out.\xc2\xa0 Would a leader-to-leader call at this point give too much credibility to a Maliki government that might not be there much longer?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate on any calls that the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated as best we can on calls.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking -- it\xe2\x80\x99s actually about the optics.\xc2\xa0 So whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99ve been made or not is irrelevant to whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re being talked about and whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve shown them.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xc2\xa0 So the fact that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard about them is substantive for the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay, then maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t showing us the calls, is it because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want us to know that the President is talking with a leader who might not be around?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a clever way of asking the question.\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I just say this:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations that have taken place in recent days from the President and Prime Minister Maliki.\xc2\xa0 But there have been a number of -- at least two that I can recall at the top of my head here -- from the Vice President to Prime Minister Maliki in the last few days.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s see -- Luis.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the case of Meriam Ibrahim, the Sudanese woman who was sentenced to hang for apostasy -- she was released, but then we have reports that she and her family were arrested at the airport while trying to leave the country.\xc2\xa0 That family includes her husband, who is a U.S. citizen, and there are reports that they were trying to head to the United States.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration following this case, and is it concerned about it?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The administration is following the case quite closely.\xc2\xa0 In fact, just Secretary Kerry himself said just yesterday that we welcome the decision by the Sudanese appeals court to order her release.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis case has rightly drawn the attention of the world and has been of deep concern to this administration and to people all across the globe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the troubling reports of her re-arrest, but are not in a position to confirm them at this point.\xc2\xa0 We urge the government of Sudan in the strongest terms to ensure her freedom and, more broadly, to respect its citizens\xe2\x80\x99 inherent right to the freedom of religion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversation yesterday.\xc2\xa0 When the President makes this call, is his purpose more to convey something to the Russian President or to maybe get some information in order to learn something?\xc2\xa0 Does he feel as if he is making progress on both of those fronts; that he understands -- in line with what Ann was asking about the President understanding the situation in his own country -- does he feel that he has a complete understanding of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in Ukraine, for instance, and especially the grievances, the legitimate grievances of the people in the east and the south of that country?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think you and I may have a different assessment about the legitimacy of some of those grievances, to put it mildly.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this -- that the President has spoken many times to President Putin, and the President himself has talked about the business-like nature of the conversations that those two leaders have.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly respects the legitimate interests that Russia has in the region, but the President is also concerned about making sure that everybody respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent nations.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there has been a pretty open channel of communication between President Obama and President Putin in relation to this issue, but also a range of other issues as well.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s talking about Ukraine on the phone yesterday or having the opportunity to visit about this in person when they were both in Normandy a few weeks ago, the President is interested in having an open and business-like dialogue with President Putin.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that in certain situations that there is a difference of opinion when it comes to some I think what are pretty basic facts to others around the globe who might have a more impartial view.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- and I think this is an important part of the relationship between the United States and Russia -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t inhibit cooperation on other important national security priorities that both countries share.\xc2\xa0 One great example of that is the success of the OPCW effort to remove the declared chemical weapons arsenal of the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 That would not have happened without the cooperation and support of the Russian government and other countries in the international community.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that despite the differences of opinion we may have about Ukraine, that the robust relationship between the United States and Russia isn\xe2\x80\x99t just good for our two countries, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 And on a slightly less weighty matter, did the World Cup come up in the conversation?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Did President Putin congratulate President Obama on the amazing, amazing performance by the American team in the World Cup?\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say the same about my side.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But does he watch those performances?\xc2\xa0 Did he watch the match with Portugal?\xc2\xa0 Does he intend to watch the match with Germany?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to the President about the soccer match.\xc2\xa0 I know that he is aware of the outcome and is very proud of a couple of strong performances by the U.S. men\xe2\x80\x99s national team.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to watch the Germany game or not.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re scheduled to be on the road that day.\xc2\xa0 But I know that the President is very proud of the performance of the team so far and is optimistic about their continued success.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tChris, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 On the planned executive order that the President is planning to sign barring LGBT discrimination by federal contractors, not a lot of information is known either about its scope or the timing either for the signing or implementation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That would be a first.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right?\xc2\xa0 It seems like you\xe2\x80\x99ve known quite a bit about this all along.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you about it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when asked, there was a lot of concern about a possibility of a religious exemption being placed in the executive order.\xc2\xa0 Could you rule out the possibility that a religious exemption will be within the executive order?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position from here to give you any greater insight about the contents of what an executive order like this might include.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s team is drafting.\xc2\xa0 And once they have finished the drafting of that and are ready for the President to sign it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to talk to you in a little bit more detail about what\xe2\x80\x99s actually included in there and what the consequences are for the President\xe2\x80\x99s signature.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House waiting for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on the Hobby Lobby case before settling on a final form of this executive order?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that there is an ongoing process as it relates to the drafting of an executive order that would take the kinds of steps the President has talked about quite a bit.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of the content or the timing of that executive order.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is the White House announcing that the President is going to sign this executive order at this time when that could have happened at any time over the course of the five and a half years of the administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t(Audience member faints).<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Everyone okay?\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we wrap it up and we\xe2\x80\x99ll bring some water out here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:57 P.M.
