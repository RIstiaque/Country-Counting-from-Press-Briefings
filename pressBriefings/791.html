Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:40 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 As you can see over my left shoulder, today the White House launched a new effort to help let Americans\xe2\x80\x99 voices be heard in this debate about our fiscal challenges, launching the #My2K online push to pass the middle-class tax cuts, a cause that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President speak about quite a bit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all remember, a year ago, during another big fight to protect middle-class families, tens of thousands of working Americans and tweeted and emailed their representatives asking them to do the right thing.\xc2\xa0 The same thing happened earlier this year when college students across the country stood up and demanded that Congress keep rates low on student loans. When the American people speak out, they help get things done in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And you heard the President ask the American people today to once again add their voices to this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>After the President\xe2\x80\x99s event, the White House is calling on Americans across the country to share on Twitter what #My2K means to them, as well as on other social media channels and on whitehouse.gov.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll highlight the #My2K stories received on whitehouse.gov and through social media to elevate the impact of inaction for middle-class families.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Kuhnhenn.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two points.\xc2\xa0 One is, you all announced this morning a meeting tomorrow, at lunch, between the President and Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 What does the President expect to get out of that meeting?\xc2\xa0 Certainly during the campaign they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to agree on much, but is there overlap in their positions on certain things that they could discuss?</p>\n<p>And then on the fiscal cliff, the President used the word \xe2\x80\x9cframework\xe2\x80\x9d today in describing what he thinks they could reach before Christmas.\xc2\xa0 Does that suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a grand bargain in the making, but more or less kind of an agreement to then pursue other elements of this down the road?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me take tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s lunch first.\xc2\xa0 During his news conference two weeks ago, the President said that there are aspects of Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s record and Governor Romney\xe2\x80\x99s ideas that he believes could be very helpful.\xc2\xa0 The President noted that Governor Romney did a terrific job running the Olympics and that that skills set lends itself to ideas that could make the federal government work better, which is a passion of the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s requested reorganization authority from the Congress to do just that.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agenda for the lunch.\xc2\xa0 The President, as he said then, looked forward to having this meeting with Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a private lunch; only the two men will be in the room.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be a useful discussion.</p>\n<p>On the negotiations and where we are now and where we end up at the end of the year, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any specifics. You saw what the President said.\xc2\xa0 His priorities continue to be that we have to take action to ensure that 98 percent of the American people do not see their taxes go up on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 That is essential.\xc2\xa0 It is something that Democrats and Republicans agree on, and it is something, because there is that agreement, we should be able to act on right away.</p>\n<p>We can also work together to build a framework, put together a proposal that should have bipartisan consensus built around the principle of balance, as we tackle our long-term and medium-term deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a lot, the three legs of that stool, that balanced stool are discretionary spending cuts, health care entitlement reforms that create savings, and revenue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some positive developments in the last several weeks in terms of what Republicans have been saying about the need for revenue as part of a balanced package. The President will continue to make the case that that is essential.\xc2\xa0 It is the only fair way to proceed, and it is the smartest way economically to proceed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Because when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing -- austerity in and of itself is not a goal.\xc2\xa0 When you are getting your deficits and debt under control, you\xe2\x80\x99re doing it as part of a -- in order to move forward towards a goal that means stronger economic growth, stronger job creation, more middle-class security.\xc2\xa0 And that requires investing in parts of our economy that will allow us to grow stronger, faster and better in the 21st century -- in education and infrastructure and research and development and the like.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to continuing discussions with ordinary Americans, with business leaders -- as you know, he has another meeting with business leaders today -- with members of Congress, leaders of Congress, as we continue to work out what he believes would be the right, balanced approach to deal with these challenges with Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There seem to be competing assessments of where things stand right now.\xc2\xa0 Erskine Bowles today told some reporters that he was pessimistic, that he only saw a one-in-three chance of a deal being struck before the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, you have Tom Cole apparently telling leaders in -- Republican leaders that they should take the 98 percent -- the tax extension for the 98 percent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Where does -- obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re -- the President is on the optimistic side of that.\xc2\xa0 But what is it that the President is willing to give in order to get the Tom Coles\xe2\x80\x99s of Congress to go along with that extension?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it seems that they\xe2\x80\x99re demanding something on entitlement reform.\xc2\xa0 Do you -- the President has offered $340 billion in cuts, in savings, over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 Is that -- does that have to be an ironclad part of the deal by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The $340 billion that you cite is what is in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important, because even though that budget proposal has been out there for a long time, a lot of people aren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of that.\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates another piece of evidence that the President has been willing to make tough choices in order to get our fiscal house in order and in order to try to reach a compromise with Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President made clear that he is not wedded to every detail of his plan, that he understands that the nature of compromise is that neither side gets everything that it wants.\xc2\xa0 And he is open to hearing realistic, concrete, mathematically sound proposals that achieve the kind of balanced approach to deficit reduction that this country needs -- deficit reduction that isn\xe2\x80\x99t borne solely by the middle class or by seniors, and deficit reduction that allows the economy to continue to grow and to create jobs and allows us to continue to invest in some of the areas I talked about before.</p>\n<p>But it is important to note that when we talk about, on the one hand, desires by Republicans to see entitlement reforms be part of a balanced package, that the President has put forward $340 billion in additional savings from our health care entitlement programs, and that that figure exceeds the amount of savings from those programs that was achieved in the Simpson-Bowles plan in its first 10 years.</p>\n<p>So this is not insignificant.\xc2\xa0 This is significant.\xc2\xa0 It is not the final word.\xc2\xa0 The President, as he said, is not wedded to every detail.\xc2\xa0 But it demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental commitment to making tough choices in order to get something done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to press Democrats to accept something like that by the end of the year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s made clear, as he has in the past, that he will be in the future willing to lead members of his party in the effort to achieve a sensible, balanced compromise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Reuters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Since your briefing yesterday, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten more feedback from people on the Hill who have met with Susan Rice.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to their comments, including this morning Susan Collins saying that she would not be able to support Ambassador Rice for Secretary of State without more information?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, my view on this is the same as it was yesterday, which is that the focus on -- and in some cases, the obsessive focus on -- Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on a series of Sunday shows several months ago is misplaced and misguided.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Rice was using unclassified talking points that were developed by the intelligence community and provided not just to her, not just to the executive branch, but to the legislative branch.\xc2\xa0 And they represented the best assessment by our intelligence professionals about what had happened in Benghazi at that time.\xc2\xa0 And that is not just me saying so; that is what the DNI and the CIA have said.</p>\n<p>Even at that time, the intelligence community was making clear, and Ambassador Rice and I and others were making clear, that these were preliminary assessments and they might evolve, and as more facts came in, we would clarify what we knew about what had happened in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the simple sort of end of story about what happened back when Ambassador Rice appeared on those Sunday shows.</p>\n<p>What I think the American people care about is not the effort by some to politicize a Sunday show appearance, but what happened actually in Benghazi, who was responsible for the deaths of four Americans, what steps we need to take to ensure that something like that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why there is an FBI investigation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why there is an Accountability Review Board established by the Secretary of State, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, to review the broader issues of security at our diplomatic facilities.\xc2\xa0 Those are the concrete issues that need to be investigated and resolved when it comes to what happened in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as I think the President has said, and I and others have said, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame to create a sideshow that seems I think very clearly to be very political out of something that really has no bearing on what happened in Benghazi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned that this sideshow may affect his nominations both for Secretary of State and for the next Director of the CIA?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has not made any personnel decisions that I can announce, and he made very clear his views on this particular issue when he answered questions about it at his press conference.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask just one more question on a different topic, following up on what Jim mentioned about Erskine Bowles.\xc2\xa0 Bowles also said that the President has some flexibility about top rates or the highest earners at 39.6 percent.\xc2\xa0 The President addressed that in his press conference as well, saying he\xe2\x80\x99s open to ideas from both sides.\xc2\xa0 How much flexibility does he have on that 39.6 percent?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, setting aside rates so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t take my answer to this question to mean specifically -- to reflect specifically on rates, if I told you how much flexibility the President had, it would eliminate his flexibility.\xc2\xa0 So the President made clear that he is not wedded to every detail of his plan.\xc2\xa0 The President has also made categorically and abundantly clear that he will not sign an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for top earners.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad economic policy and we cannot afford it.\xc2\xa0 He will not sign that.</p>\n<p>He is open to serious, realistic, concrete proposals about how we can get from here to there when we talk about building a balanced package that achieves the kind of deficit reduction target that he set, and that the Simpson-Bowles commission set, and that others have set.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One fact remains true, which is -- and he talked about this during the campaign -- the most basic, simplest, most efficient way to achieve that revenue target is by returning the rates for top earners back to those that were in place in the Clinton era. When we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about different ideas that somehow achieved significant revenue out of closing loopholes and eliminating deductions, some of them look good on paper, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not politically realistic.\xc2\xa0 And some of them don\xe2\x80\x99t even add up on paper.</p>\n<p>The President is very interested in closing loopholes and capping deductions where sensible both economically and plausible politically, but the fact remains that the cleanest, simplest way to achieve the kind of revenue target that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary here is to go back to the Clinton-era rates for top earners -- rates, by the way, that were in place during the longest period of economic growth -- peacetime economic expansion in our lifetimes; rates that were in place when the rich got a lot richer and the middle class did really well, too; the rates that were in place during a period that saw deficits disappear and to be replaced by surpluses.</p>\n<p>Now, there were some in Washington when President Clinton passed his first economic plans in 1993 who decried them as the end of the economic world as we knew it, that they would surely lead to recession and job loss and broader economic decline.\xc2\xa0 Those forecasts proved to be a little off.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re off now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do they need to be 39.6 percent?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate every detail. But it is a fact -- the President is willing to look at anything that\xe2\x80\x99s sensible and realistic and that is mathematically sound.\xc2\xa0 But our point on rates is that they are the sensible, clean, simple way and proven way to achieve the kind of revenue target that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, a proposal which includes loophole closures and deduction caps, as well, but ones that are realistic.</p>\n<p>Yes, Mary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senate Majority Leader Reid said it would be \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat foolish\xe2\x80\x9d to work out a deal to prevent the economy from going over the cliff without addressing the debt ceiling as well.\xc2\xa0 Will the President demand that Republicans agree to raise the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt limit as part of any fiscal deal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- Congress raises the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 We certainly expect that Congress will act appropriately because nobody in their right mind would want to go through what we went through last summer -- summer of 2011 -- where holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage to an ideological agenda proved disastrous to our economy and most especially to the American people and the middle class. That political strategy resulted in a significant drop in consumer confidence.\xc2\xa0 It resulted in -- it had a series of negative effects on our economy, and we certainly don\'t expect that right-minded leaders in Congress will want to travel that path again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the answer to the question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The question is -- we expect Congress to -- without drama to raise the debt limit.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as far as --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the details of a package that is still under discussion between us and the Capitol -- and members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that we certainly expect Congress to act responsibly and raise the debt ceiling.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference?\xc2\xa0 Can you say that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s preference is that Congress do its job.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder -- it sounded like, in answer to Jim\xe2\x80\x99s question when he was saying, do you have to do entitlement reform by the end of the year, your answer was in the future.\xc2\xa0 And I noted that when the President spoke today --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I didn\'t say it was in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- would pressure -- when asked about pressuring Democrats, you said, he has vowed to do that in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s done it in the past and he will do it in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have a record of what you said.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 I meant "the future" as also in the present tense.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he has committed, every time he talks about this, to a balanced approach that includes both revenues, spending cuts, and savings through entitlement reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my question is whether that is down the road or now. Because I note as well in the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments, it sounded like he was splitting the negotiation into two pieces, because he said, let\xe2\x80\x99s extend the middle-class tax cuts, and then he said, that would \xe2\x80\x9cgive us more time next year to work together on a comprehensive plan to bring down our deficits.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out whether there\xe2\x80\x99s something significant here that the White House is saying -- there\xe2\x80\x99s now essentially a two-step process; take care of the tax rates, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do this broader plan next year, which is what it sounds like what the President said.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, broadly speaking, this is obviously a complicated piece of business.\xc2\xa0 There are two pieces to it.\xc2\xa0 There are two distinct although related things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of lumped together when we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in this post-election period between now and the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 The first is the fiscal cliff, which is extremely time-sensitive and has to do with December 31st deadlines that trigger, if Congress doesn\'t act, substantial tax increases for everyone, including the middle class, and that trigger across-the-board spending cuts, the combination of which would, by many estimates, not be very good for the economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that\'s why the President has long since prior to today talked about the common-sense approach of the House following the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead and passing the extension of the tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people so that doing so would provide the kind of certainty that middle-class Americans deserve and need -- especially as we go into this holiday season -- about what their personal economic situation will look like next year.\xc2\xa0 It will provide a great deal of relief for retailers who depend on consumers for the success of their businesses.\xc2\xa0 And we can continue to work on the other issues, but since we have a chunk of the fiscal cliff, which is the imminent issue here, that can be addressed simply by extending these middle-class tax cuts, we should do that.</p>\n<p>But I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- the broader whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-step or -- I think these are all parts of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you understand the reality is that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I understand the question --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Republicans now feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lock in tax increases, which you\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lock in tax cuts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, tax cuts for 98 percent, as you said.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not extending -- voting to extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people is not voting for a tax increase.\xc2\xa0 There are tax cuts that expire at the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re saying Congress, the House, should take action to extend tax cuts for virtually --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and the Republicans are saying you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- most of the people listening to this today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but -- so the Republicans are saying on the Hill today -- Boehner had a news conference and said, so you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to lock in tax changes, however each side characterizes it, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re not having any spending cuts now.\xc2\xa0 You want to do spending cuts next year.\xc2\xa0 Is that a fact?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- no, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a fact.\xc2\xa0 I think that these are all parts of aspects of conversations that are ongoing between the White House, the President\xe2\x80\x99s team, and the congressional negotiators.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge the outcome of that.\xc2\xa0 As I said, this is a complicated piece of business and there are two components to it.\xc2\xa0 One is a fiscal cliff; the other is a desire that the President has to achieve a significant deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And one option, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a concern about putting one thing first, is simply to take up the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan and pass it because that locks in $340 billion in entitlement reform savings, it locks in spending cuts, and it locks in revenue.\xc2\xa0 So the President has put forward a plan that achieves -- that has at its basis all three legs of the stool.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one on this.\xc2\xa0 So on that very point about how the President has a plan on entitlements, so Congress can pass it, yesterday you were asked about Senator Dick Durbin saying entitlement changes like that, like the President has put on the table should not be part of the fiscal cliff talks.\xc2\xa0 And you said yesterday, "I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those comments yet."\xc2\xa0 So 24 hours have passed -- do you agree with Senator Durbin, or disagree?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, and I think what was reflected in those comments has to do with the reality -- which is forgotten sometimes as we discuss -- that there are two issues here that, while linked, are fairly distinct.\xc2\xa0 There are absolute deadlines associated with the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 There is the broader desire by the President and by leaders on Capitol Hill to achieve and lock in significant, long-term deficit reduction in a way that continues to help the economy grow and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to both, and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed and engaging right now through his team and in direct conversations in negotiations on both issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge how they come out because I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to know at this point, because this is obviously a matter of intense negotiation.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of quick follows on previously asked questions.\xc2\xa0 The meeting with Romney -- can you give us a little bit on how that came about?\xc2\xa0 Did the President call and invite him?\xc2\xa0 When?\xc2\xa0 And the President I think said he respects his ability to create efficiencies in the Olympics -- that\xe2\x80\x99s a rough memory.\xc2\xa0 Does he have a specific ask of Governor Romney in the meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does not have a specific ask.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that the topics will be many in their lunch.\xc2\xa0 The President noted during the press conference that Governor Romney was very successful in running the Olympics.\xc2\xa0 He was obviously a successful businessman and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure has some ideas that the President will find helpful.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agenda for you and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have outcomes before the meeting itself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The way it came about was that the President expressed interest in the immediate aftermath of the election in meeting with Governor Romney, and so the staffs of the two men got together and worked out a time for that to happen, and that time is tomorrow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Susan Rice, Ambassador Rice, should her meetings on the Hill be read as a trial run for possible nomination, or did she ask to go up to the Hill to have a chance to clear her name before these members?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There has been a lot of discussion about her appearances on those Sunday shows and the source of the information that she provided on those Sunday shows.\xc2\xa0 And I think she believed that it was entirely appropriate to meet with members who had been particularly interested in, and sometimes critical of, her appearances and what she said -- to meet with them and discuss exactly what happened, where the information came from.\xc2\xa0 And because, as we all know and it\'s been publicly acknowledged, what she said was based on intelligence community assessments that were provided, the Acting Director of the CIA went with her.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So she initiated it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to her office.\xc2\xa0 The issue is -- the interest has been -- the intense and, I would say, misplaced focus on her appearances has occurred not in New York but up on Capitol Hill, in particular, with a handful of senators.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And finally, on the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 To date, the administration has said that there are fiscal restraints, budget cuts that you guys have outlined in your current budget.\xc2\xa0 But given that -- you\'re asking now the GOP to go further than they\'ve gone before by raising the top rate on top earners.\xc2\xa0 Would the administration, if they were willing to do that, be willing to go further on Medicare and Medicaid than you\'ve gone in your current budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\'t get into specifics, but I will quote my boss, the President, in saying that he is not wedded to every detail and that he understands that reaching a compromise requires tough choices.\xc2\xa0 Now, he\'s made tough choices in the past in negotiations like these.\xc2\xa0 He\'s demonstrated his willingness to make tough choices in his budget, and I know that he is willing to make tough choices in the negotiations going forward.\xc2\xa0 His principles --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That sounds like a yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A possible yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s yes in the sense that he\'s willing to entertain serious, realistic proposals that reflect his principles, which are that anything that we do in this area has to be balanced.\xc2\xa0 It cannot -- it absolutely cannot put the burden solely on the middle class, solely on seniors, so that the wealthiest Americans get off light and -- because that\xe2\x80\x99s just not fair and it\'s not economically sound.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the fact is, in the decade prior to him coming to office, that was an approach that was taken and it resulted in an intense squeeze on the middle class while those top 2 percent generally did very, very well.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s time to, given our fiscal situation, to readdress that and build a package that is more fair and more balanced and that achieves the kind of deficit reduction that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, but achieves it in a way that allows the economy to grow and allows it to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Because, as I said earlier, deficit reduction is not a goal unto itself.\xc2\xa0 It has to serve the broader purpose of helping the economy grow and helping it create jobs.</p>\n<p>Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a couple on the fiscal cliff -- but with your indulgence, on Benghazi, setting aside Susan Rice\'s fate, setting aside the Sunday show appearance, I just want to talk to you about what is asserted to have happened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Senators Graham, McCain and Ayotte put out a release that said in their meetings -- as you said, the Acting CIA Director accompanied her -- and they asked the Acting CIA Director who changed the unclassified talking points to remove a reference to al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 He said, at 10:00 a.m., the FBI did.\xc2\xa0 At 4:00 p.m., according to this release, the CIA called back and said, no, that\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect, and that it wasn\'t correct; that the FBI removed it to prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation, but it was done elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Does this, to the President\'s mind, at this late stage, raise core questions of basic competency about what happened and why with these underlying talking points -- why is there --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President is worried about, Major, is what happened and why in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 He is not particularly concerned about whether the Ambassador or I went out and talked about the fact that we believed extremists might have been responsible, and whether we named them as al Qaeda or not does not have any --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- no, it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any bearing on what happened and who is responsible as that investigation was continuing in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, as we have made clear, the White House and --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any reason to doubt the sequence of events?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 The White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two -- of these two institutions were changing the word "consulate" to "diplomatic facility," because "consulate" was inaccurate.\xc2\xa0 Those talking points originated from the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 They reflect the IC\'s best assessments of what they thought had happened.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would refer you to numerous reporting -- numerous pieces of reporting by serious journalists and serious publications that demonstrate that people who participated in the assault on Benghazi were aware of what was happening in Cairo and were partly motivated by what was happening in Cairo.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that obsession here on what Ambassador Rice said on a Sunday show is simply non-material to the key question of why four Americans died in Benghazi.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand you want to characterize it as obsession. I\xe2\x80\x99m just talking about what happened yesterday.\xc2\xa0 These are two serious agencies of the federal government -- the CIA and the FBI.\xc2\xa0 The CIA told three senators the FBI did this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t speak for the CIA and the FBI.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is the suggestion --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the President is not concerned about --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- as some of the senators who put out that press release consistently said -- falsely and erroneously and knowingly -- consistently said that we provided those talking points, we at the White House -- that was false and erroneous. And they said it again and again, and they said it on your air.</p>\n<p>Your substitute yesterday claimed that the President made the case that Chris Stevens -- made the case that the video was responsible and led to the violence in Benghazi at a speech at UNGA, which is false and erroneous.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not the case.\xc2\xa0 I encourage you to go read the speech.</p>\n<p>We have to get our facts straight when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about this story, okay?\xc2\xa0 There was basic information developed by the intelligence community that was provided to Ambassador Rice, to Capitol Hill, to me and others.\xc2\xa0 We used that to describe what we understood to be known at the time in the immediate aftermath of Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 As we learned more information, we made it available. That\'s the long and short of it.</p>\n<p>What the President cares about, what he believes his responsibility is as Commander-in-Chief is to find out who was responsible and bring them to justice, and to make sure that we take action to ensure that what happened in Benghazi does not happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the fiscal cliff, you said a moment ago that there are some ideas on revenue that look good on paper but are not politically realistic.\xc2\xa0 What are those?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics, but there have been --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know what they are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have said if you didn\'t have an idea.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure, broadly speaking, when we -- you look at proposals that suggest you can achieve -- and you can on paper -- very large revenue targets purely through eliminating deductions and caps, there are only -- really basically there are two ways to do that.\xc2\xa0 The middle class gets hit hard because you raise taxes on the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Through what?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Through various closures of loopholes and deductions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- mortgage deduction and charitable deductions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are two that come to mind.\xc2\xa0 Those two -- so to achieve significant -- you can either go after the middle class, which the President has made clear is a nonstarter, and again, going after the middle class to protect the wealthiest 2 percent, or you suggest changes to our tax code when it comes to deductions and loopholes that are unrealistic politically, that Democrats and Republicans will not vote for; that you can achieve it on paper but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in those --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- again in those areas, but depending on how you slice and dice --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re referring to the mortgage deduction and charitable deductions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are other -- yes, those are two of them, but there are other loopholes and closures that are under discussion.\xc2\xa0 The point that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make is that the President is very pragmatic about this.\xc2\xa0 He believes that it is entirely appropriate, as the American people do, that the wealthiest should be asked to pay a little bit more as we develop a balanced package for long-term deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that the right way to do it, because it is mathematically sound and it is the simplest way, is to extend tax cuts for 98 percent of the American people, but not extend tax cuts for the top 2 percent because -- and also to write into law some of the other changes that he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed that include caps on deductions at 28 percent, and include other loophole closures.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he\xe2\x80\x99s open to ideas.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that there\xe2\x80\x99s only -- that there\'s one way to skin this cat, but there\xe2\x80\x99s one way to skin it that\xe2\x80\x99s clean and simple and there are other ways to skin it -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take this metaphor to dangerous places -- (laughter) -- that are full of fur balls.\xc2\xa0 So the point is that the President is open to ideas, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not open to pie-in-the-sky proposals that aren\xe2\x80\x99t realistic when it comes to asking Democrats and Republicans to pass them on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, Jay.\xc2\xa0 You\'re more than comfortable telling us what the President won\xe2\x80\x99t sign in the context of something that extends the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.\xc2\xa0 The President will not sign that.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re very comfortable saying that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Asserting that as an absolute --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- understood position of the President.\xc2\xa0 Are you similarly prepared to say that about anything that comes to the desk to resolve the fiscal cliff that does not include an increase in the debt ceiling?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I addressed this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not precisely.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, how this -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the particulars of either the deficit reduction package or how we address the fiscal cliff.\xc2\xa0 What is a fact is that it is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to ensure that the United States of America pays its bills.\xc2\xa0 It is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States of America does not default for the first time in its history.</p>\n<p>And through hard experience, it is the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that Congress will find it in its interests, as well as in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest, to ensure that the full faith and credit of the United States is fully met, without drama and without trying to play the kind of political games and ideological games that led to a downgrade, that led to a drop in consumer confidence, and that, of course, hit the middle class hardest of all.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s just not -- the President doesn\'t expect that leaders in Congress want to go there, so he expects Congress to do its job.\xc2\xa0 In what form Congress does its job --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- clear as the other issue you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say that the President absolutely expects Congress to do its job when it comes to ensuring that the United States maintains its full faith and credit.\xc2\xa0 How it does that, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to dictate to Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or when it does that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it has to do it --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 By February.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It has to do it so that it does not create a scenario that we went through last summer, which was so bad for everyone.</p>\n<p>Mike.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the campaign, the President told the Des Moines Register the ratio -- I think it was $1 in taxes for every $2.50 in cuts, if I\xe2\x80\x99m correct.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined that the President has already put forward $340 billion in proposed spending cuts in his budget I guess it was last winter.\xc2\xa0 By my math, that leaves another $2 trillion in cuts.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think there\xe2\x80\x99s $2 trillion to be --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s funny because I mentioned that so few people -- even though it\xe2\x80\x99s been out there for so long -- actually know it\xe2\x80\x99s in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, so few people, even though they talk about it all the time, actually know what\xe2\x80\x99s in the Simpson-Bowles, Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson proposal.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal included $4 trillion in deficit reduction -- $1.6 trillion from revenues; $340 billion from health care savings, entitlement program savings and savings from reduction in interest payments; and the $1 trillion-plus in non-defense discretionary savings that the President has already signed into law, as well as additional savings.\xc2\xa0 So that I think -- without the calculator in front of me -- adds up to the ratio that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve announced your Twitter campaign.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to some sort of classic swing counties around Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The election is over, man.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Evidently, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to a great company that makes great products that is very interested in middle-class Americans having --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In an area that\xe2\x80\x99s represented by\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- having that $2,000 --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- three Republicans in the House who are sort of in swing districts.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also pretty close to here.\xc2\xa0 So the point is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re making a point that I tried to make yesterday, and the President will make far better than I, that this is a debate that absolutely should involve the American people because the American people have the most at stake.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely appropriate for the President to go out and present to American businesses and ordinary Americans his views on this, and to ask them to let their voices be heard here in Washington, because that\xe2\x80\x99s how we get things done here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned this, as I talked about at the top.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about moving votes, what is it about?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about compelling action in Washington, and if that means moving votes, then that\xe2\x80\x99s what it means.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s always been the case, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I described at the top.\xc2\xa0 When the American people demand Congress to act, demand that Washington acts, and they do so by making their voices heard, Washington tends to act.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact and it\xe2\x80\x99s one that\xe2\x80\x99s as old as the Republic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there no concern about hardening political lines by going so public with all of this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at the history here.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress are elected by their constituents -- ordinary Americans in districts and states across the country.\xc2\xa0 They are answerable to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 When their constituents get involved and they say, this is what we believe you should do, members of Congress tend to listen.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how the system should work.\xc2\xa0 And the President also believes that he has a responsibility to go out into the country, to meet with ordinary Americans -- workers and business leaders and the like -- to talk about his vision and his plans when it comes to this debate, to hear their ideas, and to ask them to ensure that their voices are heard here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s, I think, a terrific description of how the system works and how it should work.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s lunch -- is there a symbolic element to this, to show the country and the world that there is this -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this fight; now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to break bread together?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there is.\xc2\xa0 I think there is a tradition here, and I think that it is one of the often-overlooked but remarkable things about this democracy, this oldest democracy, is that we have -- we consistently have elections and either pass power on to a new leader of a new power -- party, or because the voters chose, continue to invest power and authority in the office in the same party or the same individual, without violence and without the kind of anguish and disruptions that you see in so many other countries around the world, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen throughout history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that it is entirely appropriate -- and I know the President feels this way -- to continue that tradition, because fundamentally, whenever we have these elections, the two standard bearers are putting forward their visions for what they believe is best for America and the people decide which vision they prefer.\xc2\xa0 But I know the President believes that Governor Romney is -- was doing -- was arguing a case that he thought was right, and he did it forcefully, and the President did the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last week, the President gave Speaker Boehner a gift.\xc2\xa0 Will there be gifts exchanged?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s lunch to provide.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to revisit a question you had the other day about the low water levels in the Mississippi River.\xc2\xa0 Since you were asked that question, the shippers and barge industry has gotten together along -- joining Mr. Harkin in asking the President for a federal declaration ordering the Corps to take certain steps to ease the water levels.\xc2\xa0 I know that you said, talk to the Corps of Engineers, but does this issue --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Corps handles these issues.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to declarations, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that takes place and my understanding is that\xe2\x80\x99s not how it works.\xc2\xa0 So I would refer you to the Corps.\xc2\xa0 The President has been committed to ensuring that his administration takes every step possible to help farmers and ranchers affected by the drought.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the administration has already taken a variety of actions to that end.\xc2\xa0 But again, my answer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed since yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no directive that the President must take ordering --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any specific request to the President taking action.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent -- more recent natural disasters, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process by which declarations are made and requested.\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of this one in particular.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking -- the language that you\xe2\x80\x99ve had the last couple of days has been pretty harsh about people in the Senate, about Susan Rice and about -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly taken a tone that -- is it appropriate for the White House to list the criteria by which the Senate should use its advise and consent power?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not what this is about. I have been speaking specifically about the misplaced obsession and focus on an administration official\'s appearance on Sunday shows -- an administration official who had no line responsibility for security at our diplomatic facilities and no responsibility for the collection and dissemination of intelligence product.</p>\n<p>And I am not alone in judging that that obsession and focus is largely driven by political considerations.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has its constitutionally-mandated prerogative to advise and consent, and that is not what I am talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more about the meeting, the lunch tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 The language that you\'re using today about the meeting and about Governor Romney\'s strengths and what we heard the President say in the press conference, it reminds me a little bit of what was being said last January when we were talking about the reorganization of the Commerce Department.\xc2\xa0 Is Governor Romney here tomorrow in some kind of Cabinet-level position?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In some kind of audition for that position?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, is there some kind of reorganization in the Commerce Department where Governor Romney could play a role?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there is -- the President does not have a specific assignment in mind for the Governor.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to discussing with Governor Romney a variety of issues, including the President\'s interest in making the federal government more efficient -- an interest that was demonstrated by that very broad proposal that he put forward asking Congress for reorganization authority, the same authority that Presidents up through Reagan had had for a long time -- and adding what he felt was a helpful enticement, which is that he would only use that authority with the promise that any action he took to reorganize government would result in savings to the federal government.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what his proposal with regards to all the entities in government that deal with exports and commerce would do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the strengths that Governor Romney brings do comport with the kind of vision that the President has for that reorganization --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Governor Romney has many strengths, but I know that the President will look forward to having a discussion about broadly the issues of government efficiency.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sort of follow-up on a question of my colleague.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll put a new light on it.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President is painstakingly taking time to choose the best and the brightest for these senior Cabinet positions.\xc2\xa0 With one term behind him and his legacy ahead of him, what is the most important characteristic that the President looks for in choosing a Cabinet minister -- a Cabinet member, such as the Commerce or Interior or whatever we\'re talking about?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 State, DOD --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t had the discussion in a way that boils it down to one characteristic.\xc2\xa0 He looks for all the appointments he makes for individuals of skill, intelligence and character.</p>\n<p>April, and then Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, both then-candidates for the Oval Office seemed to have such disdain for one another, particularly when they were debating.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\'s stand on his emotions and his feelings with Mitt Romney now?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I would say that elections are serious business, and they tend to represent a clash of ideas and they\'re hard fought.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s certainly no different this time than it has been in every election that I\'ve been around for and covered in the past.</p>\n<p>But the President, as he said in the aftermath of the election, believes that Governor Romney has ideas that he\'s interested in that were developed through some of the experiences that Governor Romney has had in his life, and he looks forward to discussing them with Governor Romney.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the President feels pretty good about how the election turned out, if that\xe2\x80\x99s what you mean.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long is the lunch for?\xc2\xa0 Is it an hour, hour and a half, two?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an end time for you.\xc2\xa0 I think it will be a substantial lunch, if not on the plate than in the discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess in the interest of anything goes -- (laughter) -- on November 6th, the state of Colorado and the state of Washington voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s against federal law.\xc2\xa0 Does the Obama administration intend --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\'t believe you\'re the one that asked the question, Bill.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to respect those two state measures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice has said that they are reviewing these ballot initiatives to which you refer, and I would direct you to them for updates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the direction will come from the White House as to whether this is worth the Justice Department\'s time and resources, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Justice Department is the lead law enforcement agency.\xc2\xa0 And as the Justice Department has made clear, its enforcement of the Controlled-Substance Act remains unchanged.\xc2\xa0 In enacting the Controlled-Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule One controlled substance. The President, in at least a couple of interviews over the course of this year, was asked about this, and you can find his views in those interviews.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow.\xc2\xa0 In the last 11 months, according to NORML, the Obama administration -- or the Justice Department has moved to shut down 400 medical marijuana clinics in this country, which is more than happened during the entire eight years of George W. Bush\'s administration.\xc2\xa0 So that seems to be a priority for the administration.\xc2\xa0 Will that also move towards recreational --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 What the President has said is that we\'re not going to prioritize prosecutions of people with cancer or other serious illnesses.\xc2\xa0 And the President never made a commitment to give carte blanche to large-scale producers and sellers of marijuana.\xc2\xa0 And while the President has asked the Department of Justice to use prosecutorial discretion to best prioritize law enforcement resources, he cannot nullify congressional law.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you talk about setting up a framework for long-range deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 I shudder at the thought of another super committee being created over income tax or tax reform.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I feel you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President, though, ready to make some kind of ironclad commitment toward tax reform, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s a small amount, to Speaker Boehner, which he may very well need to take to his caucus for even a short-term deal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is very committed to tax reform.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s put forward a specific proposal for corporate tax reform and he has made clear his interest in individual tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Some of the changes while -- in his budget proposal he believes that the best approach is to allow the rates to revert back for top earners to the Clinton-era levels that he introduces elements of tax reform even in his own budget proposal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he remains interested in concrete, mathematically sound, politically realistic proposals that can help get this job done as long as they reflect his principles, which are shared by a significant majority of the American people, which is that we tackle this problem in a balanced way so that the middle class doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get stuck holding the bag as it pretty significantly was in the prior decade.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for Speaker Boehner?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to negotiate from the podium the particulars of what a potential compromise would look like.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear he\xe2\x80\x99s open to good ideas.\xc2\xa0 He understands that Republicans are not likely to pass his proposal in its entirety, and he\xe2\x80\x99s not wedded to every item in his proposal.\xc2\xa0 So he wants to continue to have discussions.</p>\n<p>Ann, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President indicated in his remarks today that maybe -- that he would like to have a deal by Christmas.\xc2\xa0 What happens now?\xc2\xa0 Does the President wait -- is it all in Congress\'s court?\xc2\xa0 Do they have to call and say, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready with some more concrete, realistic, mathematically-sound proposals?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I like the sound of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President remain here on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, not travel with his family, if there is still no deal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate and be so pessimistic that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve a reasonable compromise prior to then.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to working with Congress.\xc2\xa0 He has assembled a team that will work with Congress -- is and will continue to work with Congress.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific scheduling announcements to make for you, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s week has been very full meeting with various stakeholders in this debate.\xc2\xa0 It will continue to be so tomorrow and Friday, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he will have conversations with congressional leaders when appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Geithner and others will be having those conversations with their congressional counterparts in the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so there\xe2\x80\x99s not a single concrete proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s come to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read proposals from draft pieces of paper to you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously two things are true.\xc2\xa0 One is we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this debate for so long and in so much detail that we know the parameters of it.\xc2\xa0 We know what the numbers look like, especially when everybody is being honest about them.\xc2\xa0 And two, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to negotiate every detail of an unfinished and, at this point, definitely unfinished compromise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked you when, not what.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, the President -- I think the President answered that question:\xc2\xa0 by the end of the year, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he hopes and believes is possible.\xc2\xa0 Before Christmas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one -- would you please reconsider opening the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Mitt Romney to press coverage since it\xe2\x80\x99s -- (laughter) -- no, just so -- to cameras, because it\xe2\x80\x99s closed coverage and this was an historic election.\xc2\xa0 This is the first time they\xe2\x80\x99re meeting, and I would just respectfully request --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the request, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let the two men, who spent a great deal of time in the public eye over the course of the past year, both of them, have a private lunch together.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t1:34 P.M.
