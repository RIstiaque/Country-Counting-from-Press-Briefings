BST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for your patience.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s late, at least in this time zone, so I will not spend any time with announcements at the top except to welcome -- we lost power.\xc2\xa0 There we go, good.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you know, the President had a series of meetings today for part of the G8 summit and around the G8 summit.\xc2\xa0 Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor, is with me.\xc2\xa0 He can read out to you those meetings -- most recently, the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with President Putin.\xc2\xa0 I am here to take questions on other issues if you have them.\xc2\xa0 But I will turn it over to Ben for that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody, and thanks to those in Sligo for working with us through this miracle of modern technology.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'ll just go briefly over the events of the day and then focus on the Russia meeting, because I think that\'s the one of most interest right now.\xc2\xa0 But this morning, you heard the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Belfast.\xc2\xa0 After that, he was able to visit the school with Prime Minister Cameron.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that, importantly, this is an integrated school that brings together Catholics and Protestants to forge a new generation of people in Northern Ireland who are working together to advance the type of permanent peace the President spoke about in his speech.\xc2\xa0 So this school was a good symbol of the type of progress that the President was talking about in his speech.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter he came to Lough Erne for the G8 meetings, he met with the Italian Prime Minister just as an initial meeting as they kick off their working relationship; had a brief discussion of the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And the President extended an invitation for the Prime Minister to visit Washington in the near future.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll have to work out a date for that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfter that, you saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with other European leaders to launch formally the negotiations of the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership, T-TIP, which is a key part of our global trade agenda and our economic agenda promoting economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And you saw in the fact sheet that the first negotiations will kick off in July in Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFollowing that was the opening plenary on the global economy, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a statement out of the G8 on the outcome of that meeting, which focused on ways to work together to promote economic growth -- T-TIP, of course, being an important part of that -- and also how to balance the fiscal measures that are being undertaken with strategies that work together to promote growth.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut then the President had a bilateral meeting with President Putin of Russia, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go briefly through some of the highlights of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was a two-hour meeting, and as you heard both Presidents say, they had a very candid and wide-ranging discussion of a number of issues on the bilateral and global agenda.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tFirst of all, they discussed economics and how to increase trade and investment between the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve also agreed to form a working group to focus on that issue, led by Vice President Biden on the American side and Prime Minister Medvedev on the Russian side, to take up this issue of how to increase trade and commerce across the United States and Russia, given the fact that now Russia is a member of the WTO and there are good opportunities for our businesses to get into the Russian market, and then, similarly, for Russia to have increased ties with the United States.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSecondly, they discussed counterterrorism issues.\xc2\xa0 The President thanked President Putin, as you heard him indicate, for their cooperation after the Boston attacks.\xc2\xa0 And they agreed, after Boston and leading into the Olympics in Sochi, to focus on increasing the nature of our counterterrorism cooperation and they very much agree that this is an issue where the U.S. and Russia can work together.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThird, they discussed a range of issues associated with nuclear weapons and nuclear security.\xc2\xa0 They reached an agreement to renew the cooperative threat reduction program, commonly known and Nunn-Lugar, which was set to expire.\xc2\xa0 This will allow us to continue to work with Russia to secure nuclear materials not just in our countries, but also in third countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey also discussed broadly strategic stability between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 Associated with that, the President indicated that he believes that we can continue to work with Russia to pursue further reductions in nuclear arsenals beyond the New START levels.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd they also discussed missile defense.\xc2\xa0 And this is an area where they agree that we need to continue to have the type of technical exchanges and exchanges of experts so that we can forge a basis for cooperation going forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen there was a discussion of nonproliferation challenges, in particular North Korea, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve been closely coordinated and aligned generally in our view that the cycle of provocative actions needs to come to an end and we need to get back to the issue of denuclearization.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIran -- and both leaders believe that the aftermath of the Iranian election provides an opportunity to explore whether a diplomatic solution can be reached to the Iranian nuclear issue. And they agreed to continue to coordinate closely with the P5-plus-1 in pursuit of that goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen there was a discussion of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And as you heard both leaders indicate, we\xe2\x80\x99ve clearly had differences over Syria in the past and continue to have differences as it relates to principally the fact that the United States believes that any transition in Syria has to involve Bashar al-Assad leaving power. However, they do believe and recommitted themselves to working for a negotiated, political settlement to end the violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us say over the last several days, this continues to be our preference in terms of an outcome in Syria -- that if we can get the two parties to the table and help forge a political settlement that allows for a new government to emerge and the conflict to come to an end, that would be our preference, that would be Russia\xe2\x80\x99s preference, and that would be in the best interest of the Syrian people and the international community.\xc2\xa0 So in that vein, they agreed to continue to work towards a follow-on to the Geneva process in which the opposition and the regime are coming together, supported by the international community, in talks about reaching that type of political settlement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThen they touched on the broader Middle East and North Africa and the changes taking place, particularly given the focus here at the G8 on Libya and the trends in the region.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they covered a lot of ground.\xc2\xa0 The only other thing I\xe2\x80\x99d note is that the two leaders agreed that in advance of the G20 in St. Petersburg, there will be a bilateral summit between the United States and Russia in Moscow.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going to Moscow before we go to St. Petersburg for the G20.\xc2\xa0 And we surely will be continuing to discuss all of these issues as well as other things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, I know Jay would be happy to take questions on anything.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to say that in trying to incorporate both sites here, we\xe2\x80\x99ll start with four questions here, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take four via the remote site, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to bounce back and forth so that everybody has a fair opportunity.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tPeter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 Did the issue of chemical weapons come up?\xc2\xa0 And is it fair to say that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of opinion on that evidence?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The issue of chemical weapons did come up.\xc2\xa0 The President raised it and you heard him mention it in his public comments as well.\xc2\xa0 And the Russians, of course, have been more skeptical of the evidence that we put forward.\xc2\xa0 We believe to be highly confident in that evidence, given the multifaceted nature of where we\xe2\x80\x99re making our conclusions from, which is physiological samples as well as intelligence reporting, open-source reporting, and individual reports.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHowever, I think what the President\xe2\x80\x99s point was and what we want to do with the Russians is focus our efforts on empowering a U.N. investigation that can also get to the bottom of this.\xc2\xa0 So in other words, the best way to clear up these questions is for the Assad regime to provide access to that U.N. investigation, which they have so far not done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our message to the Russians, in addition to the briefing we provided them on our assessment, is that if you believe that these issues can be cleared up, then the Assad regime should allow for inspections of all of the alleged incidents, including the four incidents that we enumerated in our letter to Ban Ki-moon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think, as a general matter, the Russian government shares an interest in making sure that chemical weapon stockpiles are secure within Syria.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in nobody\xe2\x80\x99s interest that those weapons be used or transferred to terrorist organizations.\xc2\xa0 So there, too, there\xe2\x80\x99s a basis for us to cooperate.\xc2\xa0 We would like to see that lead to greater cooperation from the Assad regime in the ongoing international efforts to investigate these incidents.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJulie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 On the question about the difference on what you think should happen with Assad, did Putin give any indication that he\xe2\x80\x99s moving on that position?\xc2\xa0 And if chemical weapons evidence and just the general violence in Syria haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten him to move on that position, what do you guys have left to try to prod him along?\xc2\xa0 And if you can\'t prod him along then what\'s the point of a political conference where you\'re at odds over what the outcome should be?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the principal point is that the status quo is not one that Russia is happy with either.\xc2\xa0 The status quo is inherently unstable.\xc2\xa0 It\'s leading to refugee flows.\xc2\xa0 It\'s leading to increased violence within Syria and within the region.\xc2\xa0 You heard President Putin himself allude to the growing loss of life in the country.\xc2\xa0 And so Russia has a fundamental interest in making sure that there is some type of political process that can lead to stability in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so that\xe2\x80\x99s why they\'re not simply invested in saying, we\'re just going to back Assad and that\xe2\x80\x99s the totality of our policy.\xc2\xa0 They very much want to encourage this type of political process.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs you said, we\'ve been very clear and up front in stating our view that Assad would need to go as a part of that process.\xc2\xa0 I think the Russians would want to see those talks emerge between the opposition and elements of the regime in some type of transition plan.\xc2\xa0 But we both agree that it\'s worth getting the parties to the table to have that discussion and to have that negotiation about how a transition moves forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the Russians profoundly understand that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a political process, there\'s going to be a war, and somebody\'s going to win the war, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a very long time and a lot of people are going to die and there\'s going to be a lot of spillover effects.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not in anybody\'s interest.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why I think you heard the two leaders emphasize publicly that while we\'ve had these differences, we really do want to find some common ground here where we\'re each working to bring the parties to the table here and see what can be done through a political process -- because the alternatives, no matter how you look at it, are worse than negotiating a political settlement.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, one for you and then one for Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the talks on Syria, you and both leaders said that the conversations were very candid.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit of color?\xc2\xa0 What was the environment like when they were talking about that topic?\xc2\xa0 Was it tense?\xc2\xa0 Were the leaders open in a way we haven\'t seen before?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'d say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 And first of all, one that\xe2\x80\x99s to Julie\'s point, what you\'ve heard President Putin say a number of times is, to them, this is not all about Bashar al-Assad somehow.\xc2\xa0 To them it\'s about their interests in Syria, and their interests in Syria fundamentally have to do with stability.\xc2\xa0 And so, in other words -- Julie asked if there was movement -- again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Russians would portray this as they\'re invested just in Bashar al-Assad and no other alternative.\xc2\xa0 They\'re invested in a stable outcome, and they want to make sure that any transition that emerges preserves that goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of the atmospherics, we\'ve been having a discussion with the Russians about Syria for some time now at a variety of levels.\xc2\xa0 So they don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to review the full bidding of what\xe2\x80\x99s taken place.\xc2\xa0 So, first of all, this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the majority of the meeting; this was about a fifth of the meeting, from my understanding.\xc2\xa0 And I think there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an extended discussion as there was even in Los Cabos about the differences between the two countries.\xc2\xa0 It was more about what can we do to continue to be invested in this Geneva process; what can we do to use all the respective influence to get these parties to the table in a manner that could be successful.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is a businesslike relationship.\xc2\xa0 But these are discussions that -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if leaders have to bring each other up to speed.\xc2\xa0 They know full well the perspective that they each bring to the Syria issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, again, I think President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s point to President Putin has continued to be we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in an outcome that does restore stability; we just don\xe2\x80\x99t think that can be done unless you have a change, a circuit-breaker, essentially, in Syria where Assad steps aside.\xc2\xa0 So I think there is an intent to signal the convergence of views on a political process, understanding that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of history in terms of the differences we\xe2\x80\x99ve staked out on Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, insinuated that his Super Bowl ring was stolen by President Putin some eight years ago, and then went on to say that he had an emotional tie to it and the White House even intervened and said it would be in the interest of the U.S.-Russian relations to say it was a gift.\xc2\xa0 Was the ring stolen?\xc2\xa0 Was it a gift?\xc2\xa0 And when was the White House made aware of this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will turn that over to Ben.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any discussions that may have happened with Mr. Kraft.\xc2\xa0 This did not come up in the meeting between the Presidents.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to review whether we had any -- heard anything from Mr. Kraft, because I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly unaware of anything.\xc2\xa0 Did he suggest it was in this White House or the previous?\xc2\xa0 Because as a Jets fan, even though the Jets haven\xe2\x80\x99t won since \xe2\x80\x9969, I know the Patriots haven\xe2\x80\x99t won in a while either.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I think it was under the Bush administration that this might have taken place.\xc2\xa0 But we can check whether we ever heard from him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I had a serious one, instead of like counting how many times the Bush administration has been blamed for something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It had more to do with the Patriots than the Bush administration.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President detail the level or the kind of assistance, military assistance, in either his meeting with Letta, Cameron?\xc2\xa0 I know that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really formal with Cameron or Putin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The meeting with Cameron was rather informal, as you saw.\xc2\xa0 Syria will be on the agenda tonight at the leaders dinner, and I think the President will have opportunities to speak to some of his counterparts there.\xc2\xa0 I think with the Prime Minister of Italy, I think their discussions focused a little bit more on the economy and just kicking off their relationship.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWith respect to President Putin, I think President Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into those types of details.\xc2\xa0 We simply reiterated the reasons why we feel like it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to support an opposition in the face of a regime that has been using such horrific violence against them.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s more at the level of principle than that type of detail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So now we\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavor to take questions from the press file.\xc2\xa0 We know there will be a delay.\xc2\xa0 You might have to be self-selecting because we can\xe2\x80\x99t really see that well in terms of who gets a question.\xc2\xa0 Somebody speak up.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, it\xe2\x80\x99s Jon Karl.\xc2\xa0 Just two quick ones.\xc2\xa0 First, did Putin agree to stop sending arms to President Assad\xe2\x80\x99s government, or indicate he would continue to do so?\xc2\xa0 And just curious -- did that report about the alleged spying on Medvedev in the 2009 G20 conference come up and did the President apologize for the U.S. role in that alleged spying?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 On your second question, that issue did not come up.\xc2\xa0 Nothing came up associated with the recent disclosures, so it was a non-event at this meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs a general matter, I think the United States and Russia are well aware that each of us has an intelligence community and we have had dialogues on these issues for years.\xc2\xa0 But this didn\xe2\x80\x99t emerge as an issue at this meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn your first question, the Russian position has simply been that they\xe2\x80\x99re fulfilling contracts associated with past practices, past business with the Syrian regime.\xc2\xa0 We have indicated that we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe additional arming of a regime that\xe2\x80\x99s engaged in the activity that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of the Assad regime is in the interest of peace and stability in Syria.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the President reinforced that point as well as, in particular, the importance of ensuring that they\xe2\x80\x99re not against weapons systems that could potentially proliferate to other groups in the region through Syria.\xc2\xa0 So I think it was more a general point that he made about the lack of faith we have in the Assad regime in any way, shape, or form to use weapons responsibly.\xc2\xa0 And that was a point that he reiterated, as we often do with the Russians.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, you spoke about they agreed to work for a follow-on from the Geneva process.\xc2\xa0 That seems a lot less definitive than this idea of at some point in the next few months holding a conference in Geneva.\xc2\xa0 Has that been shelved for now because of events on the ground or difficulty in getting it to take place?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that any Geneva process would ultimately have to involve representatives empowered by the regime and by the opposition coming together in that type of conference.\xc2\xa0 So that certainly remains the goal of the Geneva track.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tClearly, the case is it will take some work to have the opposition feel like they can be invested in that type of process.\xc2\xa0 Our point has been that ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Syrian people to invest in a peaceful political track.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the Russians can play a constructive role in making clear to the Assad regime that they have an interest in coming to the table.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd they indicated that they would do that.\xc2\xa0 That is something that the Russians have committed to playing a constructive role on in terms of getting the regime seriously invested in the Geneva process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that is something we will continue to work towards.\xc2\xa0 In the interim, we want to make sure that we have an opposition that is strong and cohesive.\xc2\xa0 And part of the purpose of our policy in providing the support we have to the opposition over time has been in helping to help build an opposition that can be broadly representative of the Syrian people, that can include the different factions from within the country, that they can express a moderate platform about Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future, given our concern about some extremist groups.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our investment in the opposition is an investment in a future of Syria that can hold together and that can be on the other end of that type of political track.\xc2\xa0 But in the meantime, we need to make sure that they have the capability, the wherewithal, to meet humanitarian needs where they can and to also meet their defense capabilities.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI should add just one thing, since I meant to do it in the opening.\xc2\xa0 Tonight in the dinner discussion, the President will also indicate, consistent with a call that has gone out for the United Nations for additional humanitarian assistance into Syria, that the U.S. will be providing over $300 million in additional humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And that includes food, medical equipment, water, shelter for people both within Syria and in neighboring countries.\xc2\xa0 And a significant amount of that funding will go inside of Syria -- a little less than half\xc2\xa0 -- and then a significant amount will go to some of the countries bearing the burden of these refugee populations -- Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt as well.\xc2\xa0 Because the international community has an obligation, even as we deal with the political situation and the security situation, to address the humanitarian situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I mention that -- I meant to in the opening.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that new money, Ben, or is that money that\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s new money.\xc2\xa0 So that will bring -- we\'ll have a fact sheet on that, but that will bring the total assistance that we provided on the humanitarian side to over $800 million.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Mr. Putin at all responsive to the idea of peeling Assad away from the rest of his regime and letting someone under him basically negotiate with the opposition -- which seems to be your strategy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Again, like I said, I think the fundamental view expressed by Russia is not that this is all about Assad.\xc2\xa0 To them, it\'s all about having a stable outcome.\xc2\xa0 So in terms of who comes to the table, that type of discussion, it\'s certainly the case that you could have empowered representatives of the regime. And in terms of how it unfolds, it\'s our belief that we can get to an outcome in which there\'s an agreement for Assad to step down as part of that process.\xc2\xa0 Because basically there\'s no way you can foresee, given what\'s happened, the opposition coming to terms with a leader who has been so abhorrent in the conduct he\'s carried out against his people -- killing tens of thousands of people, including so many innocent civilians.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we believe Russia\'s investment here is not in one man, it is not just in Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 It\'s in a stable outcome.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that that can be reached through this type of Geneva political track that is what we\'re pursuing.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, guys, it\'s Shawna Thomas from NBC.\xc2\xa0 Did the Russians agree to allow the U.N. -- to push Assad to allow the U.N. for their own investigation?\xc2\xa0 And yesterday, Putin had much more colorful language with Prime Minister Cameron about people helping out the opposition.\xc2\xa0 Was any of that kind of language behind closed doors?\xc2\xa0 What do you think accounted for a lighter tone in front of cameras?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s noteworthy, because I think both leaders went out of their way to underscore that they can work together on this issue, and that we don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to focus on -- the differences are well known, but that if we are sending a message that the U.S. and Russia, as two leading world powers and two countries who\xe2\x80\x99ve been deeply engaged in the Syria crisis, if they can project a message that they have a convergence of views as it relates to a political negotiation, that keeps the possibility, the prospect of that political track alive.\xc2\xa0 So I think you saw an intentional effort by both leaders to underscore where there was convergence in their views.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJeff.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Further on the tone, aside from the bit about Judo at the end, it seemed particularly relaxed to me.\xc2\xa0 Can you give an overall description of what the tone was like during the meeting? And secondly, given both the differences and the areas of agreement, how will you move forward tonight with common language or uncommon language in the communiqu\xc3\xa9 about Syria?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think this question around kind of the body language comes up every time we meet with the Russians now.\xc2\xa0 And I think the -- well, what you see is what you get, and the sense that this is a business-like leader in President Putin and these are business-like discussions.\xc2\xa0 But the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of the meeting was they were able to really have an in-depth exchange.\xc2\xa0 It went two hours, it went far over the time budgeted for it precisely because they\xe2\x80\x99re each leaders who kind of get right to the point here and don\xe2\x80\x99t need to circle around it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think you got a sense that these are some of the most difficult issues in the world today.\xc2\xa0 And if you go down the list of what they talked about, many of these are issues where we reached an agreement:\xc2\xa0 to have an economic coordinating body to restart the cooperative threat reduction program; to cooperate on nuclear security; on Iran, to send a common message; and on Afghanistan, we still transport our troops in and out of Afghanistan through Russia.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe point being is that there\xe2\x80\x99s bandwidth in the relationship for a lot of cooperation, even when we have difference, and even within the Syria issue, there\xe2\x80\x99s that bandwidth.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the message that the leaders wanted to send.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd they had a discussion that was a bit broader than the specifics here about the nature of this relationship and is this relationship going to be one that allows us to work together in a positive environment or are we going to kind of go down a spiral of having a series of irritants.\xc2\xa0 And they both expressed that it\xe2\x80\x99s not in anybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest for the U.S. and Russia to go through that type of process; that we need to invest in one another and invest in having a constructive relationship.\xc2\xa0 So that was the general tone of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 And your --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The communiqu\xc3\xa9?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.\xc2\xa0 The leaders will discuss Syria tonight at the dinner, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what type of language.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly evident that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference of view on Syria between the United States and some of our -- well, the former G7, and Russia has taken a different position.\xc2\xa0 But I think the goal of working these issues through a G8 is to see what type of common ground can we forge, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing at the dinner tonight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, on the issue of military support, until now the conduits for arms to the rebels had come through Arab countries, Persian Gulf countries.\xc2\xa0 And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard much from the G8 allies or some other European allies to join the President as the President has done.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk -- even though there\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical support from France -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s risk that the President stands alone or the U.S. stands alone among the larger industrial allies on that issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an ironic question because it frequently comes at the other way, that the Europeans are doing more when, in fact, I think on Syria as a general matter we have been a leading provider of humanitarian assistance, on non-lethal assistance, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking this step to provide support for the military opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn terms of -- I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is that nations that are most immediately affected in the region are the most invested in this process.\xc2\xa0 And so it\xe2\x80\x99s only natural that Turkey and Jordan, which border Syria, as well as the Gulf countries -- Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar -- have provided significant support to the opposition and are deeply invested because this is their neighborhood.\xc2\xa0 These refugees pose a direct threat to their security.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see a massacre happening so close to their borders.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see the type of interference that Iran and Hezbollah have shown inside of Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think it\xe2\x80\x99s natural that the most invested countries in terms of support to the opposition are going to be the countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 I think what you see from our European allies, and particularly France and the United Kingdom, is a significant amount of political support for the opposition.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve provided assistance to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 They have lifted an arms embargo through the European Union to open up a broader set of options for them to consider in terms of their support for the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they are aligned with our policy in terms of having a robust set of pressures on the Assad regime, significant assistance flowing into the opposition, coordination with the 11 countries in Europe and the region who are working most closely with the opposition, but also supporting a political track.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think the President feels like he\'s in good alignment with Prime Minister Cameron, President Hollande and our principal European partners on the issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would the President prefer to have their specific military support?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think each country -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for them -- each country is going to make their own determinations about the type of assistance they\'re going to provide.\xc2\xa0 I think we want -- and I know there\'s so much focus on the military side, but we want to strengthen the opposition comprehensively -- as a political entity, as an entity that can provide humanitarian support to the Syrian people, as an entity that can come to the negotiating table, and to the military opposition as well.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd different nations are going to be able to feed into that process in different ways, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we had this Friends of the Syrian People grouping, that\xe2\x80\x99s why they have this core group of 11 nations who come together precisely to determine essentially how can different nations add value and the types of support they\'re providing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so part of this is giving a coordinating mechanism so that we\'re not working across purposes; in fact, what we\'re doing is amplifying each other\'s support.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, you\'re going to have a range of types of support from different countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, I\'m sorry, I was fielding some emails so could you address Nunn-Lugar?\xc2\xa0 I apologize.\xc2\xa0 But the Russians have not been at all eager to extend that umbrella agreement, and it was -- the President\'s remarks suggested something short of a pure extension.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what concessions maybe the United States has made, or what modifications there have been?\xc2\xa0 And was there any discussion of human rights in some of those political trials, like Pussy Riot, to -- or did the fact that this didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in their public remarks indicate it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up privately as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, with respect to Nunn-Lugar, you\'re right, the Russians have been raising concerns about how to renew this program, which is precisely why we were very pleased we were able to reach an agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think their concerns were well founded in some respects, in that the Nunn-Lugar program was designed in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and that involved very aggressive efforts to secure materials in Russia and across the Soviet Union.\xc2\xa0 So that demanded a certain set of agreements between the United States and Russia.\xc2\xa0 And, in some respects, it involved a very aggressive and intrusive set of efforts in securing those materials.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis will be a new framework for cooperative threat reduction.\xc2\xa0 But it meets our standard because it allows for us to cooperate on nuclear security issues in both countries -- in Russia and the United States -- but also, importantly, joint efforts that we can undertake in other countries.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll give you an example of that.\xc2\xa0 For instance, in the context of the nuclear security summits we\'ve been having, the United States and Russia have worked together in Central Asian countries to help them remove stockpiles of HEU.\xc2\xa0 So for instance, you remember the announcement that President Obama was able to make with President Medvedev and the leader of Kazakhstan about the removal of a significant amount of enriched uranium.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo in other words, it meets -- what it allows us to do is the baseline activities that are necessary for nuclear security:\xc2\xa0 working together, in both the United States and Russia and around the world, to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we\'re going to reach the goal the President has set of making sure that we can secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what about human rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I should end -- yes, this did come up.\xc2\xa0 And the President raised it in the context of making clear that what you see in the public back and forth on these issues is the sense that our concern about human rights is intended to undermine the Russian government in some way.\xc2\xa0 We think the President\'s point that he made is simply that the United States speaks out for certain things as a matter of principle; it\'s not targeted at any political agenda.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we do all over the world; it\'s not at all unique to Russia.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so it came up in that context and it came up in this context of making clear that we\'re going to have differences, but that those differences should not stand in the way of us working together on a very broad agenda that we have with the Russians as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 As we bring this home, let\'s go to the filing center.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just specifically on the two countries\xe2\x80\x99 respective differences in military assistance to the opposing sides in the Syrian civil war, was there any progress made on the differences they have with military assistance of any kind at all?\xc2\xa0 Or was there a sharpening of differences there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, there certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a sharpening of differences.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the Russian perspective has been that they want to fulfill the contracts that they have.\xc2\xa0 Our perspective on their assistance has been that the Assad regime is not a regime that should continue to receive arms, given what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done with them.\xc2\xa0 And this is the fundamental difference we have about the legitimacy of the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, we have a different perspective as it relates to support for the regime and support for the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think one area where we communicate to the Russians -- how we can find a convergence of interest.\xc2\xa0 For instance, Russia has expressed concerned about the emergence of extremist elements in the opposition, and we share those concerns.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve identified the al Nusra front as a terrorist organization.\xc2\xa0 And part of the rationale of supporting the opposition is to create a more moderate foundation for opponents of the regime so that we\xe2\x80\x99re marginalizing extremists and empowering people that we believe will respect the rights of the Syrian people in a post-Assad Syria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our point to the Russians is, we can actually share your interest here.\xc2\xa0 Both of us would be put at risk if extremists were able to get a foothold in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why we want to strengthen a moderate opposition.\xc2\xa0 And, by the way, those are the people that would represent the opposition if we were able to move forward with a Geneva process.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult in the current environment; we understand that, given the situation on the ground.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut that\xe2\x80\x99s where I think there can be convergence in our perspectives, because the objectives of where we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get in Syria when they\xe2\x80\x99re articulated are not necessarily different.\xc2\xa0 We both want to see an end to the conflict.\xc2\xa0 We both want to see stability.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see extremists gain a foothold.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur point to Russia is this status quo is not taking you in that direction, and that the only way to get in that direction is both to see that there is an opposition that is more moderate, that can come together with elements of the regime, and to have this type of political process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is an important point we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times:\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t envision the dissolution of the government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not saying that the institutions of the state, including people that the Russians have relationships with, need to be wiped out.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re saying that Bashar al-Assad, the top of this regime has lot their legitimacy.\xc2\xa0 We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a dissolution of the institutions of the state.\xc2\xa0 So what you want to see is some type of transition that preserves state institutions but brings in the opposition and vests them in a transitional authority that we can have confidence will respect the rights of the Syrian people and bring about an end to the violence.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, going back to the meeting with Letta and the economic aspect -- we know that Italy wants to promote growth, which is in line with the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So how -- can you go in detail about addressing that?\xc2\xa0 And was there a discussion maybe to isolate some of the European countries that are more cautious about growth, like Germany?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, first of all, President Obama was able to express support for Prime Minister Letta\xe2\x80\x99s economic program and his emphasis on growth.\xc2\xa0 President Obama also indicated that he knew that there are some very tough decisions that have been taken in Italy, and there are going to be tough challenges ahead.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted him to know very much that he has a partner in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for the meeting and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for the invitation to Washington.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThey do share an agreement that there needs to be an emphasis on growth, and that in the context of fiscal consolidation there are growth strategies that are pursued at the same time.\xc2\xa0 And that ultimately is what\xe2\x80\x99s going to lift countries out of recession.\xc2\xa0 And I think we see that that is not as controversial or in dispute as an idea as it was a year or two ago at these types of summits.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen -- clearly there\xe2\x80\x99s not a uniformity of view within Europe, but I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a greater convergence around the notion that growth needs to be a part of the equation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was a key reason for expressing very early on in Prime Minister Letta\xe2\x80\x99s tenure our support for the economic challenges that he has to deal with and the program that he set out for doing so.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If we have time for one more if there is more in the filing center.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on the question of Mr. Letta, is there any plan about the stabilization of Libya?\xc2\xa0 You talked about the issue was discussed with the President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The question is about the discussion of Libya, and there was.\xc2\xa0 The Italians have worked very closely with us and other European partners around how to support Libya\xe2\x80\x99s transition, which is noted between the two leaders, but I think this will be a bigger focus tonight and tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what we want to discuss with our European allies is how can we provide support for Libyan security forces.\xc2\xa0 You have a situation of a very unstable security environment with different armed groups -- militias and some extremist groups -- operating within the country.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a leader in Zeidan that we believe wants to move the country in the right direction -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s here at the G8.\xc2\xa0 And so I think what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see is an effort by the United States and our European allies to come to a common position as to how we can express that support and implement that support for the Libyan leader and the Libyan people as they work through a very difficult transition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just real quick on tomorrow and tax avoidance -- obviously, a big push.\xc2\xa0 Any areas of disagreement, or is pretty much everyone on the same page?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, my understanding is, thus far, there\xe2\x80\x99s an intent to find agreement.\xc2\xa0 You heard Caroline speak about this at length the other day, but essentially the goal of cracking down on tax avoidance, bringing greater transparency to it, this is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued in the United States and we agree with Prime Minister Cameron that we can work together multilaterally to promote approaches that achieve those objectives.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the discussions tomorrow, but I think thus far the atmosphere has been one of seeking to find common ground.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 Hope this worked for you.\xc2\xa0 It was excellent for us.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:17 P.M.
