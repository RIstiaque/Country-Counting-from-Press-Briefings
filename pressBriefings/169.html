Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0I brought a couple of guests to the briefing today. \xc2\xa0I know many of you have been packing your bags to accompany the President on what looks to be a long trip to Turkey, Malaysia and the Philippines. \xc2\xa0So both the President\xe2\x80\x99s National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, and one of her deputies, Ben Rhodes, will be here to talk to you about the trip and some of the themes that will be emphasized in the context of the trip. \xc2\xa0And then I\'ll stick around for a handful of questions that they\xe2\x80\x99ll take, and we\'ll go back to our regularly scheduled program from there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSusan, I think you\'re going to kick us off.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0It\'s good to see you all. \xc2\xa0I wanted to spend a few minutes as we prepare to depart for Turkey, the Philippines and Malaysia to offer you a bit of a preview of what you can expect in the coming days. \xc2\xa0I\'ll spend a couple minutes discussing themes for each stop before asking Ben to run through the itinerary, and then we\'ll take a few questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, on Saturday afternoon, the President will leave for Turkey and the G20 Summit. \xc2\xa0This will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s ninth G20. \xc2\xa0The G20 is the world\xe2\x80\x99s premier forum for economic policy cooperation, where leaders representing economies that account for about 85 percent of global GDP assemble to promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth, and to address urgent global economic challenges. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will discuss concrete actions to strengthen the global economy, to make growth more inclusive, to enhance the resilience of the international financial system, globalize investment to raise long-term growth, and implement previous commitments on economic reform and labor markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the G20\xe2\x80\x99s core economic and financial issues, the President will address additional challenges, including climate change, cybersecurity, refugees, global health security, and counterterrorism. \xc2\xa0The setting in Turkey, in addition, obviously, will make Syria a topic of conversation. \xc2\xa0The venue will provide a forum to reinforce the complementary nature of our military and diplomatic efforts to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, as we work to bring about a political solution to the broader Syrian conflict.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will depart Turkey and then head to Asia for six days. \xc2\xa0We will, in the Philippines and Malaysia, shift our focus to TPP and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s broader rebalance to Asia. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me say a few words about the rebalance strategy. \xc2\xa0At its heart, the President\xe2\x80\x99s rebalance to Asia is about building a rules-based order in Asia in which all countries pursue their national interests and their prosperity peacefully. \xc2\xa0We\'re working to strengthen respect for international norms, principles and values that offer everyone in the region an opportunity to compete and grow on an equal footing, and that certain shared responsibilities are assumed irrespective of relative size or strength.</p>\n<p>\n\tEvery facet of the rebalance is aimed at advancing this vision and we\'re working to promote it on multiple fronts that you will see as evident during the course of the trip. \xc2\xa0We\'re strengthening relations with our treaty allies. \xc2\xa0We\'re building ties to new partners and strengthening regional institutions such as APEC and the East Asia Summit in meetings that the President will participate in next week. \xc2\xa0And these, together, all help write the region\xe2\x80\x99s rules of the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re also focused on building an open economic architecture, one with high standards and clear transparent rules that support American prosperity and American jobs. \xc2\xa0And that\'s, of course, where TPP fits in. \xc2\xa0TPP is central to our vision of the region\xe2\x80\x99s future and our place in it. \xc2\xa0And one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s top priorities is to secure passage of TPP through Congress and to implement the agreement, which is a critical step towards a high-standard free trade area in Asia and the Pacific, and our goal of revitalizing the open rules-based economic system that the U.S. has led since World War II.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis agreement is a confirmation -- is the encapsulation of years of negotiations, encompassing countries that today account for nearly 40 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s GDP. \xc2\xa0It puts in place historic labor and environmental standards that will ensure our trading partners play by our rules and our values. \xc2\xa0Equally important, the TPP helps to underscore what the President determined when he came into office, and that is that America\xe2\x80\x99s interests are integrally linked to the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0This is where our security interests meet our economic interests in an undeniable way, and as such, you can rest assured that we will remain present, engaged and active across the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn keeping with this theme, the President will travel to Malaysia, where he\'ll participate in the APEC leaders meetings, and -- excuse me -- in Manila, where he\'ll participate in the APEC meetings, and then to Kuala Lumpur, where he\'ll take part in both the East Asia Summit and the U.S.-ASEAN Summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Manila, the President will also engage in a series of bilateral meetings, and these visits together will show not only the strength of our rebalance strategy with the conclusion of the TPP, but also American leadership on the political and security issues that are critical to sustaining the rules-based order in Asia, including maritime, cyber, and human rights.</p>\n<p>\n\tI just want to conclude by saying that this is a particularly significant year for the region\xe2\x80\x99s institutions. \xc2\xa0The East Asia Summit celebrates its tenth year as the region\xe2\x80\x99s premier leader-level forum for addressing political and security issues, while ASEAN will launch its ASEAN Community, including the ASEAN Economic Community. \xc2\xa0And with our ASEAN friends, we plan to outline new ways that will enhance the U.S.-ASEAN partnership. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the course of our visit to Asia, the President will hold a number of bilateral meetings with key allies and partners, including the leaders of Australia, Canada, Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia -- all of which underscore the importance of our alliances and the security partnerships across the Pacific. \xc2\xa0The President also looks forward to the opportunity to meet the Prime Minister of Laos, as Laos will prepare to take on the role of ASEAN chair in 2016. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this will be a broad-based agenda. \xc2\xa0Ben will walk you through the various aspects of it. \xc2\xa0But I think also in the Philippines and Malaysia you\xe2\x80\x99ll see an opportunity to underscore our commitment to addressing climate change, broader security, counterterrorism, economic issues, as well as our people-to-people ties. \xc2\xa0And throughout, support for human rights and vibrant civil societies, as always, will remain at the forefront of our foreign policy agenda. \xc2\xa0The President will engage with leaders on this issue, both publicly and privately, and demonstrate our support for human rights throughout the course of the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll also be highlighting our concerns about the global refugee crisis. \xc2\xa0And the President will have an opportunity to visit a refugee center in Malaysia to highlight our shared duty to provide refugee support, which is an area where the United States and Malaysia have made important contributions to vulnerable people over the years.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let me stop here, and before we take your questions let me hand it over to Ben, who will highlight some of the specific events of the itinerary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0So let me just run through the particulars of the itinerary, make a few comments about what the President will be focused on, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll move to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be beginning this trip in Turkey for the G20 Summit, as Susan indicated. \xc2\xa0When we arrive in Turkey on Sunday, November 15th, the day after my birthday, for those keeping score -- (laughter) -- the President will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Erdogan of Turkey. \xc2\xa0Clearly in addition to discussing the G20 Summit and the agenda there, the two leaders will also be focused on our counter-ISIL efforts and the situation in Syria, where Turkey has been a critical ally and partner.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing that bilateral meeting, the President will then attend the G20 welcome ceremony and the G20 working lunch, which is focused on development and climate change. \xc2\xa0After that, there is a G20 working session on the global economy, focused on growth strategies and employment. \xc2\xa0That evening, there is a working dinner among the leaders. \xc2\xa0This is focused on global challenges, particularly terrorism and the refugee situation will be topics on the agenda there.</p>\n<p>\n\tMonday, the G20 Summit continues in Turkey. \xc2\xa0The G20 meeting Monday morning is focused on enhancing resilience through financial regulation, international tax, anti-corruption and IMF reform. \xc2\xa0And afterward, the President will attend a working lunch on trade, energy and the adoption of the communique. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the afternoon, following the conclusion of the G20 Summit, the President will host a Quint meeting with our key European allies -- the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Chancellor Merkel of Germany, President Hollande of France, and Prime Minister Renzi of Italy. \xc2\xa0This is an important opportunity for the President to meet with our close European allies to discuss the ongoing counter-ISIL campaign as well as the situation in Ukraine, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve coordinated very closely with Europe in our support for the Ukrainian government, support for the Minsk process, and, of course, standing up to efforts by Russia that violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the conclusion of that meeting, the President will host a press conference before he departs Turkey for Manila.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, November 18th, after arriving in Manila, the President will host a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Turnbull of Australia. \xc2\xa0This is the first meeting that the President will have with the Prime Minister of Australia. \xc2\xa0We clearly coordinate very closely with the Australians on many issues, including the counter-ISIL campaign, our commitment to maritime security, and TPP, of which Australia is a critical member.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Australia, the President will take part in an event that showcases U.S. maritime security assistance to the Philippines and the region. \xc2\xa0And clearly, in our alliance with the Philippines and our focus in the region, we have been committed to maritime security, to principles like freedom of navigation, and to the peaceful resolution of disputes. \xc2\xa0And, again, this event will be an opportunity for the President to showcase some of that maritime security assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, November 18th, the President will begin his day with a bilateral meeting with President Aquino of the Philippines, where he will address a number of issues related to our alliance, including our support for economic growth and development in the Philippines, our support for maritime security, and, of course, coordinating with President Aquino as he prepares to host the APEC Leaders\xe2\x80\x99 Summit. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLater that morning, the President will take part in a CEO summit at APEC where he will be focused on the issue of climate change as we prepare for the Paris meeting later this year. \xc2\xa0And I should add, throughout the course of this summit in Asia, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President focus on a number of the affirmative issues that are very critical to his foreign policy agenda. \xc2\xa0That includes maritime security, as I suggested; it includes a successful Paris outcome in confronting the threat of climate change; and it of course includes our support for ratification of TPP, which is an anchor of both our economic approach, but also our commitment to a rules-based order in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing this participation in the CEO summit, the President will participate in a meeting with his TPP leader counterparts. \xc2\xa0This will be the first time that the leaders of the various TPP countries will be able to come together since the completion and publication of the text. \xc2\xa0So the leaders will have an opportunity to mark this enormous progress, and to demonstrate their shared commitment to moving forward with TPP.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater in the afternoon, the President will participate in a meeting of the Pacific Alliance with the leaders of the 21 APEC countries, as well as Colombia, which is a member of the Pacific Alliance here in the Americas. \xc2\xa0I would note that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important and welcome that Colombia is able to participate in this global forum, particularly at a moment when Colombia is making great strides in its own economy, and, of course, in the peace process that it is pursuing with the FARC.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat evening, the President will attend an APEC welcome dinner and cultural performance, and that initiates the formal APEC Summit.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the 19th, is the APEC Summit events. \xc2\xa0So throughout the course of the day, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be participating in several APEC meetings. \xc2\xa0In addition, he will have two bilateral meetings. \xc2\xa0He will have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Canada. \xc2\xa0As with Australia, this is the first opportunity for the President to meet face to face with the Prime Minister of Canada. \xc2\xa0He was able to speak to him twice on the phone already, congratulate him on his resounding electoral win. Clearly, Canada is also a country where we have enormous overlapping interests, including the TPP; including our shared commitment to counterterrorism; and also our cooperation here in the hemisphere.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the meeting with Canada, the President will have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. \xc2\xa0This is the first meeting that the two leaders have had since Prime Minister Abe\xe2\x80\x99s visit and state dinner here in April. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to review the key issues in our alliance. \xc2\xa0And of course, Japan too is a TPP country.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, November 20th, the President will leave Manila and fly to Kuala Lumpur. \xc2\xa0Upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur, the President will participate in a town hall meeting with members of our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative. \xc2\xa0This is our key showcase people-to-people initiative in Southeast Asia. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s generated enormous enthusiasm and participation, as with the Young African Leaders Initiative. \xc2\xa0So in this town hall meeting, the President will have an opportunity to speak to and take questions from young people who are participating in YSEALI. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSaturday, November 21st, the President will begin his day with a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Nagib of Malaysia, as the host of the ASEAN and East Asia summits. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss a number of issues of mutual interest from maritime security cooperation to the successful conclusion of TPP, which, of course, Malaysia is a member of. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to review the agenda for the ASEAN and East Asia summits.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater that day, as Susan referenced, the President will visit a refugee center in Malaysia. \xc2\xa0This will be a manifestation of our commitment to work with countries like Malaysia that are doing their part in the context of the global refugee challenge. A lot of attention has been put on Europe as it relates to the refugee issue, but there has also been significant refugee flows in Asia and the Pacific, as well. \xc2\xa0Malaysia has consistently throughout the years stepped up to host its share of refugees. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to highlight U.S. support for refugees and displaced persons worldwide at this refugee center.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat evening, as Susan mentioned, the President will meet with the Prime Minister of Laos. \xc2\xa0I was recently able to travel to Laos, which is hosting next year\xe2\x80\x99s ASEAN and East Asia summit. The U.S. and Laos are working together as Laos prepares to take the chair of these important multilateral bodies. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the opportunity to express our full support for working with Laos throughout its chairmanship.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen that evening the President will participate in the U.S.-ASEAN meeting with the various ASEAN leaders before attending the East Asia Summit dinner and cultural performance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen finally, on Sunday, the 22nd, the President will attend the East Asia Summit leaders meetings, which again will address the broad economic, political, and security picture in the region. \xc2\xa0In addition he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Singapore, one of our closest partners in the region, also a TPP country, as well. \xc2\xa0And then the President will have a press conference before he departs for Washington.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore we move to questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d also just add that at the ASEAN Summit the President will have the opportunity to meet with and see, along with the other ASEAN leaders, the President of Burma. \xc2\xa0I just want to make a few comments about the election that recently took place there. \xc2\xa0This is in many ways a momentous opportunity for the people of Burma. \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen take place on Sunday was a nationwide vote. \xc2\xa0We had been very focused on this election as a critical milestone in evaluating Burma\xe2\x80\x99s democratic transition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States participated along with many international monitors in working to ensure that the election was credible, inclusive, that there was transparency, and that it reflected the will of the people of Burma. \xc2\xa0Thus far, I think the results demonstrate that there was broad participation in the election, and a clear commitment from the authorities to, again, allow the people\xe2\x80\x99s voices to be heard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou saw last night the President made calls to both President Thein Sein and to Aung San Suu Kyi. \xc2\xa0And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far is clearly Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD political party have performed very, very well. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen very positive statements from President Thein Sein and from the leadership of the military in Burma, pledging to respect the result of the election, issuing congratulations to the NLD for their performance. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, we believe this sends a very positive signal that an election took place, the people\xe2\x80\x99s voices were heard, the authorities are committing and pledging to respect the results of that election. \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s message was very much that this is an opportunity now for the key leaders of the country to come together as they prepare for a new parliament to be seated in January and for vice presidents and presidents to be chosen early next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf they can continue in this spirit of national unity, this is an enormous opportunity for the people of Burma. \xc2\xa0There are huge challenges that remain in the country -- to complete the national reconciliation process with various ethnic groups and to address the humanitarian challenge in Rakhine State. \xc2\xa0But, again, I think if we were to predict five or six years ago that we would be standing here today having just witnessed a nationwide election in Burma in which Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD were able to freely participate and campaign vigorously in that election, perform very well, and have that result welcomed by the relevant Burmese authorities and the military, I think very few of us would have predicted that that would be the case. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to both Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s decades-long commitment to democracy in Burma, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the government remaining committed to a democratic transition that is not yet complete but has the potential to advance significantly because of this election.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo with that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve probably got time for four or five questions here so let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0Andrew, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0With regard to what you -- just a couple of questions about this idea of a rules-based order in Asia. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99d expect that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to achieve some kind of code of conduct at one of the meetings in order that some of the maritime disputes and air identification disputes are resolved in an easier manner. \xc2\xa0And secondly, on the Burmese elections, do you think the Burmese need to change the rules to allow Aung San Suu Kyi to become President?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, let me address the question about the code of conduct and maritime issues in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this will be a central issue of discussion, both at the East Asia Summit as well as the ASEAN-U.S. Summit and the other engagements that we have throughout our visit to Asia. \xc2\xa0Our view has always been that these disputes need to be resolved through peaceful, legal means and that the establishment of an implementation of a code of conduct agreed among the leaders of the region, the states of the region, and in particular the claimants, would be a positive step forward. \xc2\xa0This, though, is not a U.S. agreement or U.S. code. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s one that would need to be implemented by the parties involved. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that this will continue to be something that we and others encourage, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be a concrete outcome of this particular visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0So with respect to the constitutional reform in Burma, we have consistently said over the course of the last several years that a full transition to democratic civilian rule in Burma would require a process of constitutional reform. \xc2\xa0For instance, even with this election, 25 percent of the seats in the parliament are reserved for the military. \xc2\xa0So this election was selecting the remaining 75 percent. \xc2\xa0And then of course there are the amendment procedures that prohibit Aung San Suu Kyi from assuming the presidency. \xc2\xa0You heard President Obama, when he was in Burma with Aung San Suu Kyi, indicate that he did not think that those restrictions made sense and appeared to single her out.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, she\xe2\x80\x99s a member of parliament. \xc2\xa0She is the clear leader of the NLD. \xc2\xa0I was in Burma a few weeks ago; I met with her as well as Burmese officials. \xc2\xa0She campaigned across the country and her party did remarkably well. \xc2\xa0The Union Election Commission is still putting out the results, but I think every indication is they\xe2\x80\x99re already very close to having an outright majority, even with that 25 percent blocked for the military and, indeed, as additional results come out, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that they will have that outright majority in which case clearly she will be in a very strong position as the leader of the NLD.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoing forward, this is a question for the leaders and people of Burma to determine. \xc2\xa0In the first case, we very much encouraged her in her efforts as she\xe2\x80\x99s reached out to the leadership of the USDP, the governing party and the military, in pursuit of having a dialogue between them. \xc2\xa0And the President has indicated -- the President of Burma, that is -- his openness to that type of dialogue. \xc2\xa0So in the first case I think in the coming weeks what we want to see are the key players, key political actors and institutions in Burma sitting down together to process these election results and to look ahead to the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tA new parliament will then be seated in January and there will be a period of time before they select a president and several vice presidents. \xc2\xa0At some point, it will be up to that new parliament and to those leaders to make determinations about the reform of the constitution. \xc2\xa0And, again, I think Aung San Suu Kyi is in a very strong position as the leader of the NLD to be a leading voice about the future direction of the country. \xc2\xa0So what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen here is an election that didn\xe2\x80\x99t resolve every issue, did not resolve the constitutional issue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons why we said this election wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to complete the democratic transition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut clearly it is an important milestone and an historic milestone in enabling the people of Burma to vote for their parliamentary leaders, enabling Aung San Suu Kyi and her party to participate in the process and to do very well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think many were somewhat haunted by the experience of 1990, when you had a decisive NLD victory followed by the subsequent imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi. \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing thus far that is different, again, is congratulations from the military and the leadership of the USDP to the NLD on their performance in the election and a commitment to respect that result. \xc2\xa0That alone I think speaks to enormous progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made in Burma, even as there are many more issues to be dealt with.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Kathleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If I could turn to the talks you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have over Syria in Turkey. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like the President has a formal meeting with Vladimir Putin on his schedule, if this is right. \xc2\xa0Do you expect that they\xe2\x80\x99ll meet and talk? \xc2\xa0And it looks like Putin will be arriving with a peace proposal in hand. \xc2\xa0If you could talk a little bit about what you think about that proposal, and whether or not this might demonstrate that Putin is not as isolated as the U.S. once imagined two years ago. \xc2\xa0Attempts to isolate him have failed, it seems.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Well, let me begin with your first question, which is there is not a formal meeting between the President and Mr. Putin on the schedule, but as has often been the case at the G20 and other multilateral leaders\xe2\x80\x99 meetings, we fully expect they\xe2\x80\x99ll have ample opportunity for discussion directly. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first point.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecondly, recall that the G20 meeting will come just after Secretary Kerry again convened the key countries in Vienna along with the United Nations to press forward on the political process. \xc2\xa0We have been working with all of the key players in that configuration, including the Russians, on our thoughts and our various respective partners\xe2\x80\x99 thoughts about the substance of a potential transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Russians certainly have their ideas; we have ours; other players have theirs. \xc2\xa0And this discussion in Vienna will be an opportunity to try to see the extent to which we can forge a common way forward, such that we have a concrete -- ultimately, a concrete transition plan that enables Syrians to decide their future for themselves peacefully, securely, and in accordance with their popular will.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any indication that President Putin\xe2\x80\x99s isolation is diminished. \xc2\xa0That is a function of the actions he took to violate Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The sanctions remain intact. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99re all very realistic that for the conflict in Syria to be resolved, which it must, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require all the relevant players to come to a common understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow on that real quickly. \xc2\xa0Do you expect or do you anticipate any concrete action on Syria then coming out of the Kerry meeting and then out of the meetings that you guys will have on the sidelines on Syria? \xc2\xa0And then secondly, do you think the President is disappointed that this is such a summit-heavy trip that he -- is back-to-back-to-back four summits and not -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have more of a chance to do what he likes to do on these trips and sort of take in the countries and the cultural stuff? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that as a yes from the grins. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0The first part about concrete outcomes -- first of all, we view the dialogue about the political process in Syria as being a process. \xc2\xa0It is not about a single meeting or a single event. \xc2\xa0These issues are hugely complex and fraught. \xc2\xa0If they weren\xe2\x80\x99t, they would have been resolved a long time ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we fully anticipate that there will be more meetings like the one last -- couple weeks ago in Vienna, like the one coming up on Saturday. \xc2\xa0We view the discussions of the G20 as a useful opportunity for the key leaders to touch base and try to further concert our efforts. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody expects a single outcome that all of a sudden readily resolves all these difficult issues. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re looking to try to use these venues to make incremental progress toward the objective that we all seek.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, obviously, will be in a unique opportunity to, first of all, spend time with President Erdogan, who\xe2\x80\x99s a very important player and partner in the counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0The meeting that Ben described among our key European partners -- what we call the Quint, with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- key coalition partners of the United States and our 65-member global coalition will be an opportunity to discuss in depth the counter-ISIL campaign and the steps we\xe2\x80\x99re all taking to intensify our efforts in that regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then, of course, the discussions in the room at dinner and on the margins we expect will serve to try to push forward our shared interests in a political process that results ultimately in a genuine transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I can do the second one, yes. \xc2\xa0So, Mike, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d say first of all that, as a New Yorker, and mindful of a Woody Allen maxim of how much of life is showing up -- and in Asia in particular, it really matters to attend these summits at the level of the leader. \xc2\xa0That was not the case before President Obama took office, and so we made it actually a common occurrence -- an annual occurrence that the President would attend the ASEAN Summit at the leaders level, and the East-Asia Summit at the leaders level, precisely because we want the United States to be at the table at the Asia Pacific in shaping the future of the region, and signaling that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be present.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen we\xe2\x80\x99re not at the table, we\xe2\x80\x99re on the menu. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0And when we\xe2\x80\x99re there, we can actually shape this agenda and elevate issues that are of interest and concern to us. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, your point is well taken, which is that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important I think -- the way the President looks at foreign policy is that, in addition to the meetings that take place in convention centers, that he\xe2\x80\x99s engaging people, that he\xe2\x80\x99s reaching out to different sectors of society that we\'re visiting. \xc2\xa0So, for instance, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we very deliberately made sure that he has a town hall meeting with young people in Malaysia, for instance; that he\xe2\x80\x99s getting out and getting to a refugee center and seeing people in Malaysia who\xe2\x80\x99ve had to flee conflict or a humanitarian catastrophe; or going to a coastal facility in the Philippines to showcase our maritime cooperation with the Philippines.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we very deliberately look at these visits as a way of broadening our outreach to publics beyond that leader-to-leader engagement that happens in the summit. \xc2\xa0And we, of course, also regularly look for ways to engage with members of civil society along the way. \xc2\xa0And I\'m sure that will be the case as we go through this visit.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you sort of explain for us how you\'re thinking about what the President is going to say about where the ISIL campaign is, particularly in light of the Sinjar offensive, in light of these diplomatic talks, and considering what\xe2\x80\x99s happened on the ground with Russia? \xc2\xa0What is the message? \xc2\xa0Is this a new phase in the campaign against ISIS? \xc2\xa0And on the refugee center, can you explain why the President is visiting in Malaysia and not in Turkey, given the hemorrhage out of Syria into Turkey and the destabilizing factor?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0The message is very straightforward, and we will be at the G20 and in the subsequent summits with many of the key players who have participated with us in the counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0And we\'re now over a year into it, and I think we can point to areas of significant progress. \xc2\xa0But we\'ve also been very straightforward in saying, look, we\'re taking stock of what is working; we will do more of what works, and that which has not worked, as well, we will move away from.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we are very much keying with our partners, particularly at the G20, to focus on the political process, which is integral ultimately to the successful resolution of the conflict in Syria, which is necessary for the counter-ISIL campaign to have maximum effect. \xc2\xa0At the same time, we\'ll be in a position to highlight a number of the steps that the United States and our partners are taking to intensify the counter-ISIL campaign. \xc2\xa0And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a number of those announced over the last several days and weeks, including our deepened and intensified air presence based out of Turkey, at Incirlik, along with others of our allies in defense of Turkey but also in support of the counter-ISIL campaign in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are intensifying our support for the Syrian Arab Coalition as they move to increase the pressure on Raqqa, including through the support of the deployment of a small number of American Special Forces to engage in a liaison and assistance mission with them. \xc2\xa0We are working, as we have been, with the Iraqi Kurds, as we see most recently in Sinjar, as well as with the Iraqi security forces on multiple axes inside of Iraq to increase the pressure on ISIL. \xc2\xa0We continue to intensify and increase our support to key neighboring states and partners in the region such as Jordan and Lebanon.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a multifaceted effort where the coalition efforts are increasing not only on the military front but along various lines of efforts, countering the foreign fighter flow, countering financial flows to ISIL, countering ISIL messaging, providing support and stabilization inside the conflict zones, and increased humanitarian assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo all of this is part of a whole. \xc2\xa0It has been from the outset a collective effort that involves the meaningful contributions of a wide range of allies around the world, and it will continue to be that. \xc2\xa0And we will concert, as always, our efforts to not only intensify the counter-ISIL campaign but intensify, in parallel, the political process.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0And quickly on your second question, Margaret, it harkens a little bit back to Mike\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0The fact of the matter is our schedule in Turkey over the course of two days is very much dominated by the G20 and associated meetings. \xc2\xa0However, refugees will be front and center at that summit. \xc2\xa0In fact, President Erdogan has indicated one of the principal topics at the dinner at the leader level on the first night -- Sunday night -- will be the refugee crisis in Europe broadly and certainly emanating from Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would say that doing the event in Malaysia does highlight the fact that this is a global challenge. \xc2\xa0There are enormous refugee flows out of Syria and into Europe; there are enormous refugee flows in Africa; there are enormous refugee flows in Asia. \xc2\xa0Malaysia hosts a very significant population of refugees, including a significant number of Rohingya, who have had to leave because of the humanitarian catastrophe in parts of Rakhine State, as well as victims of human trafficking in the region. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think we very deliberately will indicate in Malaysia that the President going to a refugee center, lifting up that piece of work by Malaysia is not focused just on Malaysia or Asia, but rather speaks to the global responsibility that countries have to provide support for refugees, either in hosting them or providing assistance or taking in a portion of refugees, as the United States and many of our allies and partners do.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Jon, I\'ll give you the last one before we let these two go.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it possible to have a resolution to the crisis in Syria that leaves Assad in power, as apparently Putin is proposing? \xc2\xa0And why not have a formal meeting scheduled with him? I mean, you certainly have no shortage of things to talk to Vladimir Putin about. \xc2\xa0I understand you may have a meeting on the sidelines, but why not have a formal meeting with him? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd if I could just get a factual question to you. \xc2\xa0Ben Carson, in the debates, regarding Syria, said that there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that the Chinese are involved in Syria. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if that\'s true.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0What does he mean by involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, it was a little unclear, but it was in the context of the Russians, the Russians and the Chinese --</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I really can\'t speak to what he was referring to. \xc2\xa0But unless you\'re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I\'m not sure what he was referring to.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any military-to-military involvement -- which was the implication?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0I have not seen any evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of a formal meeting with Putin, as you know, the President not long ago -- really about six weeks ago -- had the opportunity to speak at length with President Putin at the General Assembly. \xc2\xa0That was a useful discussion. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that they will have ample opportunity as I said to speak again in Antalya and we fully expect that and look forward to it. \xc2\xa0But as Ben described, this schedule is very packed and there are, frankly, a number of bilateral meetings that would be nice to have had in Antalya that won\xe2\x80\x99t be possible in the compressed time that we have.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we expect that the President will have the opportunity to see Putin and others not only at the G20 in Turkey but we also know, for example, that President Putin will be in Paris at the Climate Summit. \xc2\xa0A number of the other leaders will be at either APEC or EAS. \xc2\xa0So this is going to be something of a moveable feast over the course of the next two weeks and I think all of the key leaders will have more than one opportunity to exchange over the course of that period.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat was your first?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Assad -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to have a solution in Syria that leaves Assad in power.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0We do not believe so. \xc2\xa0Our strong view is that Assad has lost all legitimacy; that the fact that he has been directly responsible for the deaths of so many of his own people means that a transition ultimately will have to result in a legitimate government coming to power in the context of a transition. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to envision how that could be accomplished with Assad still in power.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes, and I was going to say, Jon -- not to engage the -- I think Susan answered the specific question on China\xe2\x80\x99s military involvement in Syria, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth stepping back and noting that China makes it a practice to not get extended into military conflicts in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn many respects, their policy over many years, if not decades, has been to not be overextended in military exercises. \xc2\xa0I think it speaks to our commitment to deal very clearly with our interests in Syria and in the Middle East in ways that deny terrorists a safe haven, that support the sovereignty and security of our allies, but we also recognize that we can\xe2\x80\x99t continually be overextended in the Middle East because we have significant global interests. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis trip speaks to that I think through the literal manifestation of what the President is doing, beginning in Turkey but then moving on to the Asia Pacific where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be focused on climate change, on TPP, on supporting this democratic transition in Burma. \xc2\xa0We have to balance very broad global interests that include the situation in Syria and counterterrorism, but, by definition as a global leader, must include the Asia Pacific. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do make the point that I think as people are evaluating what it takes for America to sustain its global leadership, the test of that global leadership is not how much are we investing militarily in the Middle East. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s how are we addressing our interests in the Middle East, including with our military, but making sure that we have the resources, the bandwidth, the diplomatic prioritization to look at a whole range of global challenges. \xc2\xa0That, in many respects, is what the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy has been about, and I think that will be on display where you will see him very much in a leadership role and the counter-ISIL effort but also at the table in the Asia Pacific, preparing for the Paris climate talks, pushing through for ratification of TPP, supporting, again, this democratic transition in Burma, and ensuring that the United States is at the table in the Asia Pacific as well as in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0Look forward to traveling with you. \xc2\xa0Get some rest. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a long tour. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What are you getting Ben for his birthday?</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Ben\xe2\x80\x99s birthday -- it\xe2\x80\x99s mine as well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Happy birthday! \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAMBASSADOR RICE: \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be getting each other something. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess we can look forward to a lot of birthday cake on this trip. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond what they had to say, we can go to your questions on that topic or any others that may be on your mind today. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When is your birthday? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not until January, but you can start shopping now, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tGo ahead, Kathleen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99ll switch to the Guantanamo Bay closure plan -- your favorite topic. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You guys had the National Security Advisor out here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, and again, yes, when? \xc2\xa0So it looks like it may not be released until the President has left the building. \xc2\xa0Is there a reason why the President maybe isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to announce this formally and be involved in its rollout? \xc2\xa0Is he distancing himself from it in some way or putting this sort of off on to the Pentagon? \xc2\xa0Can you describe any update on it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of timing. \xc2\xa0I think the relatively soon construction that I\xe2\x80\x99ve used in the past is still operative. \xc2\xa0And in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s involvement on this, the President is deeply involved. \xc2\xa0This was the highest-profile announcement that the President made on his second full day in office, his commitment to closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is no denying that this is not just a top priority for the country and for the administration, it\xe2\x80\x99s a top priority for the President personally. \xc2\xa0And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him expend significant time and energy to finding a way to overcome congressional obstruction to achieving this goal. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the plan itself, there\xe2\x80\x99s no big mystery here, so I certainly would not anticipate a lot of surprise once the plan is presented. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about what the strategy is. \xc2\xa0There was a process that was undertaken in the first week of the administration to review the case files of all of those who were detained at the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0A number of those individuals were cleared for transfer, and the administration has worked diligently with our partners around the world to secure their agreements to take on some of these detainees and impose some limitations on those detainees consistent with our desire to mitigate the threat that they may pose to the United States and our interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s another group of detainees that have been cleared for prosecution, and there is a case that can be brought against them either in a military commission or in a criminal court of law. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s a small group of detainees that are not likely to be able to be safely transferred or effectively prosecuted.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is we do know that there are effective ways to safely detain them that don\xe2\x80\x99t run so contrary to our interests and that don\xe2\x80\x99t essentially overcharge American taxpayers. \xc2\xa0And this is the plan that we are seeking to implement. \xc2\xa0And at every turn it seems that Congress has attempted to put obstacles in our path of achieving this goal. \xc2\xa0And despite that obstruction, we have succeeded in transferring more than 100 individuals from the prison at Guantanamo Bay to other countries around the world. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that since the President first took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that needs to be done here, so your interest in reviewing the plan is certainly understandable. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about extensively from here, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect any major plot twists associated with the presentation of the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what\xe2\x80\x99s the holdup?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what you can expect, though, is a carefully considered, thoughtful plan that will include some specifics that heretofore have not been previously discussed. \xc2\xa0And this is something that the Pentagon has been principally responsible for putting together, and so that would explain their significant involvement in this effort. \xc2\xa0But this is something that the President has spoken with the Secretary of Defense on a number of occasions, and I would anticipate that when the plan is presented, that it will not just represent the important work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done at the Department of Defense, but it will also represent the priorities that have been outlined by the President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hi. \xc2\xa0This really was a question that I was going to ask Ben and Susan, but I wanted to hear a little bit more about the South China Sea and how the President might address that in his trip, particularly at APEC in Manila, where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to see Chinese President Xi. \xc2\xa0To what extent, if any, will he actually bring that up? \xc2\xa0And how will his message -- what will his message be to China and their neighbors, especially since we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen these freedom of operations, of navigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The fact is, it is going to come up in the context of the meetings. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that the President may bring it up. \xc2\xa0I think there\xe2\x80\x99s an even greater possibility that the participants in some of these multilateral meetings will bring it up.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an issue of significant concern to a number of countries that will be participating in these meetings. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just referring to China. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m referring to other countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, that have significant concerns about Chinese claims in the South China Sea that seem to impinge on the kind of generally accepted claims that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, the thing that will also be repeated in the context of these meetings is that the United States takes no position on competing sovereignty claims to land features in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0But what we do take a strong position on is protecting the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea and airspace that\xe2\x80\x99s guaranteed to all countries. \xc2\xa0And that was on -- that commitment was demonstrated in the context of the freedom of navigation operation that was carried out by the Department of Defense in the last couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0I also wanted to ask, following the arrest and extradition yesterday of relatives of Venezuela President Maduro in Haiti -- we\xe2\x80\x99re watching the legal side of that -- I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on an ongoing case, but just diplomatically, what does this mean for U.S. relations with Venezuela, especially as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some warming, if you could call it that, of ties earlier this year? \xc2\xa0Is this a step back? \xc2\xa0And is Venezuela -- does the U.S. view the Venezuelan government as unable to handle the vast problem of drug cartels and conspiracy within its country?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Julia, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to give you a specific answer to that question, primarily because I can confirm that there are two individuals in Haiti who have been arrested on charges that they were conspiring to bring a significant quantity of cocaine into the United States. \xc2\xa0However, I cannot confirm the identity of those individuals.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what I can say as a general matter is the Department of Defense takes quite seriously the responsibility that they have to enforce the laws of the United States. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re able to work with countries throughout the hemisphere to enforce these laws. \xc2\xa0But as it relates to what impact it may have on our broader relations with Venezuela, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for me to comment on without either confirming or not the identity of the individuals that have been arrested.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is DOD involved, or do you mean the Justice Department?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I meant the Justice Department. \xc2\xa0If I misspoke and said DOD I apologize.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Laura.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a big story in France today about the climate controls with a statement made by John Kerry, the U.S. Secretary of State, who said that \xe2\x80\x9cit definitely will not be a treaty.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Francois Hollande, the French President, reacted to that. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see what President Hollande had to say. \xc2\xa0Do you want to read that to me and I can try to give you a reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Paris agreement must be an international, legally binding agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What we are seeking, Laura, are significant commitments from countries around the world to combatting climate change. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to require countries making good on promises to cut carbon pollution, and to doing so in a transparent, verifiable manner. \xc2\xa0That is our goal. \xc2\xa0And there are significant global consequences for our ability to do that. \xc2\xa0There are also significant consequences for the U.S. economy for doing that. \xc2\xa0And what those agreements look like and how the countries who are participating will mutually pledge their commitment is something that will be discussed at the talks. \xc2\xa0And so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge that from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- between the United States and France regarding what could be accomplished there in a legal way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There may be some -- that\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to assess. \xc2\xa0What I will say is that the United States remains committed to following through on our commitments, and having a serious conversation about how other countries can both make ambitious commitments, but also demonstrate their commitment to following through on them in a transparent and verifiable way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Another question on Guantanamo. \xc2\xa0Can you expect the plan before the departure of the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you on the timing other than relatively soon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What does it mean, \xe2\x80\x9crelatively soon?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I guess that would fit into that definition, but not necessarily tomorrow. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Mount Sinjar, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure there was an answer to the question of what exactly the status of things is there now. \xc2\xa0And is the area secure? \xc2\xa0Is the fighting continuing? \xc2\xa0And aside from -- or in addition to the U.S. airstrikes, was there other U.S. involvement in the planning and execution of that operation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ron, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a detailed operational update on the situation there. \xc2\xa0I do think that there continues to be some updated -- or there does continue to be some ongoing fighting in that region. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense who may be able to give you some more specific updates. \xc2\xa0I know that one thing I can speak to is that one important role that the United States and our coalition partners played was in carrying out some military airstrikes in advance of the ground defensive that was launched by the Peshmerga who were leading the effort to retake Sinjar.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there was no other U.S. role, other than the airstrikes? \xc2\xa0Or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know of that role, but for any additional operational activities, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Specifically on the refugee issue, in describing the overall situation there, I think it was Ambassador Rice who used words like \xe2\x80\x9cbeing realistic,\xe2\x80\x9d and an \xe2\x80\x9cincremental process\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of Syria generally. \xc2\xa0But how -- or does the administration look at the refugee, that acute problem, in the same manner that there\xe2\x80\x99s only incremental progress that can be made and that you have to be realistic about this exploding problem that\xe2\x80\x99s happening right now and getting worse by the day?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding was that, based on her answer that she was talking specifically about the ongoing political effort that Secretary Kerry is leading. \xc2\xa0And I think that was an indication that we do not expect any sort of political diplomatic breakthrough at the Vienna talks that Secretary Kerry will be leading tomorrow, but we are looking to make some additional progress, and even incremental progress that she described would be important to ultimately reaching a solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the refugees, I think the situation there continues to be quite troubling. \xc2\xa0And I think the United States\xe2\x80\x99 status as the largest donor of humanitarian assistance to that effort is an indication of how troubled we are about that humanitarian situation. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be a discussion at the G20 about what additional contributions countries around the world can make to alleviate some of the suffering that we see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Given the big contribution of the United States, the problem is still there. \xc2\xa0Is there anything else specifically that President Obama is trying to do or trying to initiate to, again, stop this problem today? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We do know that the crux of this problem is the political failure of the Assad regime to effectively lead that country. \xc2\xa0And that is precisely why the United States has invested so much time and energy and sweat equity in trying to bring all of the relevant parties to the table to engage in a conversation about the kind of political transition that\xe2\x80\x99s needed inside of Syria that would at least reduce the violence in that country, and create an opening so that more Syrians can come home. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re realistic, as Susan said, about the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be announced tomorrow, for instance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just lastly, on the Burmese elections, I remember the readout you gave about the phone calls the President had and this issue of the constitutional provision that bars Suu Kyi from becoming President. \xc2\xa0Now that the elections are done and the result are pretty much known, did the President speak specifically to that issue with the President or with Suu Kyi? \xc2\xa0And does he intend to specifically speak to the issue with leaders at the -- during his travels coming up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more detailed readout than what we put out first thing this morning. \xc2\xa0I will note that all of the parties who were involved in the Burma elections have, to their credit, been quite respectful of the ongoing process to tally the votes and ultimately report the results. \xc2\xa0And both the incumbent party and the NLD party have been quite forward-leaning about urging their party members to not unilaterally declare victory, but rather to be respectful of that independent process. \xc2\xa0So I certainly want to heed those admonitions as well, and I think Ben was precise in talking about the results. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I do think you can expect that the President will be talking with other leaders in Asia in the context of these meetings about how significant the results of this election are, principally, in the first instance, because the elections out-performed expectations in terms of what voter turnout would look like, how much confidence there would be in the integrity of the election, and that the earlier results are encouraging in terms of the number of people who showed up to vote and the confidence that we have in an accurate tally. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. \xc2\xa0And I do think that bodes well for the future of Burma.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it sounds like the President does not consider this constitutional provision about the presidency a settled issue -- or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, when the President visited Burma last year, he talked about the need for the Burmese government and the Burmese people to consider some constitutional reforms, particularly given the unfair provision that essentially singles out Aung San Suu Kyi in making her ineligible to serve as President. \xc2\xa0Even this provision about reserving 25 percent of the seats in the legislature for the military is something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect the kinds of broad democratic principles that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see Burma adopt.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, thanks. \xc2\xa0I want to draw your attention to something that Donald Trump said on \xe2\x80\x9cThe O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly Factor\xe2\x80\x9d last night. \xc2\xa0You may or may not have had a chance to hear it, but it was very similar to something he said during the most recent GOP debate. \xc2\xa0He said, speaking about illegal immigration and trying to figure out a way to send back potentially millions of people, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have a deportation force, and you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to do it humanely.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0He pointed to the actions of former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, for example, many, many years ago. \xc2\xa0And I know, as a general matter, you don\xe2\x80\x99t like to sort of intervene on a -- wade into the GOP primary talk, but I thought it would be instructive, at a minimum, if not just interesting conversation, to get your perspective from the executive branch. \xc2\xa0Would something like that be feasible, for example? \xc2\xa0A deportation force? \xc2\xa0And what do you make of the comparisons with what happened under President Eisenhower and Truman?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the historical reference that I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Mr. Trump make to the Eisenhower administration. \xc2\xa0I think that our law enforcement professionals have indicated that the kind of effort to deport 12 million immigrants from this country is unrealistic, both as a practical matter but also as a fiscal matter. \xc2\xa0That would cause -- it would cost a lot of money. And it would also put us in a situation where our law enforcement resources are not being effectively targeted at those individuals that do pose the greatest risk to our communities and to our national security.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the President has said is that given our limited law enforcement resources, we should be focused on those who have been convicted of gang offenses, or convicted of serious violent crimes -- not on tearing apart families. \xc2\xa0And I think this is just one of many places where Mr. Trump is fundamentally in a place that does not reflect the broad view of a vast majority of Americans in terms of how inhumane what he\xe2\x80\x99s emphasizing is, but also how he refuses to discuss how much it would cost and how he refuses to recognize what impact that would actually have on the safety of our communities and the safety of our country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick follow-up then, just to play devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate for a second. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99re not putting a price tag on the rule of law when you say it\xe2\x80\x99s expensive, therefore we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, are you?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\xe2\x80\x99m suggesting is, is that if this is what his proposal is, that he should explain how he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay for it. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a controversial notion. \xc2\xa0And I think it warrants mentioning that Republicans in the House of Representatives last year had an opportunity to allow a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform bill to come to the floor of the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0That bill included an historic investment in border security, but it was blocked by Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, it sounds like -- when it comes to enforcement, it sounds like Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s concerns are probably more effectively directed to the House Republican leadership who actually blocked the kind of investment that would be necessary to fulfill the kind of policy that Mr. Trump is talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the Gitmo plan, we\xe2\x80\x99re already hearing from some Republicans bracing for any potential executive action that comes even with maybe a lawsuit, and that includes John McCain, who actually is in favor of closing it. \xc2\xa0So I know that --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Gives you a pretty good sense of what we\xe2\x80\x99re up against, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to ask you about.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Even our friends on this issue are threatening lawsuits.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, well, I wanted to -- I know you said that you are focused on the plan and not necessarily executive action, of course. \xc2\xa0But what do you think of those kinds of thoughts that this could end up in court if executive action is taken? \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m guess that that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be any kind of obstacle to the President taking that kind of action.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are a number of times where Republicans have threatened legal action, I think most prominently when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, where their legal efforts have not at all been successful. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve had two Supreme Court rulings now that have overturned significant Republican threats to the Affordable Care Act law. \xc2\xa0So I guess I would say from one standpoint that the track record of House Republicans in this regard is not particularly good. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are some other places where we are continuing to have an argument through the courts, particularly when it comes to immigration reform. \xc2\xa0But specifically on this issue, I think if this is an issue that ends up in court, it will be as a result of the abject failure of the United States Congress to put the national security interests of the United States first.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there is a common-sense way for us to proceed in closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0This is a policy and a strategy that is backed not just by this President, but by his Republican predecessor who opened the prison in the first place. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s also backed by Secretaries of State that have served Democratic and Republican administrations. \xc2\xa0This is a policy that is supported by the last three chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \xc2\xa0This is a policy that is supported by General David Petraeus, who I know is someone that Senator McCain looks up to.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo what we would like to see is Congress engage constructively in a strategy that is supported by people who have dedicated their lives to protecting the country. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re just asking members of Congress to fulfill their responsibility to put the interests of the country ahead of their narrower political interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because there is such opposition to the way the President would take that action if he were to do so, and similar actions in the past -- even among some people who support the end result, they just don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to act in that way. \xc2\xa0So does the President see taking that action as an absolute last resort that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to do? \xc2\xa0Or is it a very viable option considering that it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Congress doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go along with his plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I have indicated is that the President is -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take anything off the table when it comes to what the President can do to accomplish this goal. \xc2\xa0And our strong preference would be to engage Congress in a constructive discussion about how they can cooperate in the achievement of a national security priority that has strong bipartisan support among people who have spent the vast majority of their careers protecting the country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to achieve. \xc2\xa0And it remains to be seen exactly what Congress\xe2\x80\x99s reaction will be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And on the Russian plane crash, how would you characterize the sharing of information that\xe2\x80\x99s going on between the U.S. -- or among the U.S., Russia and Egypt? \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. getting adequate information from them? \xc2\xa0And how would you sort of describe the way the U.S. is sharing information in turn with them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, since the day of the crash, or at least the day after, U.S. officials were in touch with Egyptian and Russian officials who have been involved in trying to get to the bottom of what exactly occurred. \xc2\xa0We have offered assistance as they conduct this investigation, and those lines of communication remain open. \xc2\xa0The extent of that information sharing is not something I can discuss in much detail publicly. \xc2\xa0But there certainly is a willingness and there has been some follow-through on those commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you say that the -- I know you won\'t go into great detail, but do you feel like you\'re getting adequate information from Egypt and from the Russian investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly are interested in understanding what they have learned thus far. \xc2\xa0But given that they are the principal investigators and they\xe2\x80\x99re investigating a terrible incident that occurred on Egyptian soil and affected the lives of hundreds of innocent Russians, the information flow is primarily to them, not from them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\'re going to continue to stay in touch, and we certainly are interested in understanding as much as we can about what exactly happened so that we can adjust our security posture as necessary to ensure the safety of the traveling public.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the process after this reports comes out? \xc2\xa0I mean, you transmit it to the Hill; you release it publicly, whatever. \xc2\xa0Do you want Congress to act on it in some fashion? \xc2\xa0Are you expecting, like, hearings? \xc2\xa0Do you want them to -- is there any hope in heck of them doing anything about it other than pitching it aside?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'ll have to see. \xc2\xa0I think our hope would be that Congress would review the report, agree that it is a reasonable approach to accomplishing this goal of closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay that advances our national security interests and actually advanced the interests of taxpayers, too. And what we would like Congress to do is to take steps to remove the obstacles that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place that prevent the implementation of this plan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But to do that, they would have to specifically repeal language that the Senate just passed 91 to 3, I think it was.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, that may be what\xe2\x80\x99s required. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, Congress will have to consider the plan and determine what steps they need to take to allow the plan to be implemented.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this has been our objection for quite some time. \xc2\xa0Congress has frequently included language in the National Defense Authorization Act that prevents the implementation of this plan. And so we\'re hoping that by being more specific about what the plan includes that Congress will -- members of Congress will come to their senses and remove the obstacles that prevent the implementation of a plan that\'s in the best interests of our national security and the best interests of ensuring that we\'re being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So unless they specifically vote to reverse the language that the President is going to be signing presumably any day now, only executive action will allow him to make good on his order of his second day in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, what I have indicated is we\'re not going to take anything off the table in terms of options that may be available to the President, but our first choice would be to garner cooperation from the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to check something with you, Josh. \xc2\xa0When Ben talks about this meeting between Prime Minister Trudeau and the President in Manila, you refer to counterterrorism. \xc2\xa0The operation against ISIL, is it under this big umbrella of counterterrorism?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think what Ben is referring to is that the United States does have an important counterterrorism relationship with authorities in the Philippines. \xc2\xa0Isn\'t that what you asked about?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Maybe I misunderstood your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The bilat between Prime Minister Trudeau and the President in Manila --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay, in the Philippines.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sorry, that\'s my fault. \xc2\xa0So he talked about the three main topics -- there are going to be other ones -- and counterterrorism is one of them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Understood.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it about the hemisphere or also the operations against ISIL?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about both in terms of our efforts to coordinate on our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, but there are broader areas where the United States and Canada coordinate our efforts to ensure the safety and security of both the Canadian people and the American people, and that counterterrorism relationship has been important to our national security and it\'s one that we will ensure continues under the leadership of Prime Minister Trudeau.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to convince the Prime Minister to keep on fighting ISIL with the coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly are -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard me say in the past, we value the contribution that Canada has made thus far to our counter-ISIL coalition, and their contribution has been important. \xc2\xa0And we certainly are interested in having a conversation with Prime Minister Trudeau to talk about their ongoing commitment to this effort. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Hoping it\'s going to continue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'ll have a conversation. \xc2\xa0Obviously, he made some promises in the context of his campaign and he\'ll have to -- as he now has assumed the office of Prime Minister, is going to have to make a range of decisions about what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s national security. \xc2\xa0That\'s what his responsibility is. \xc2\xa0But this certainly is an opportunity for he and the President to have a conversation about how our mutual interests are and can be advanced through the effective implementation of our strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you say that it\'s in the best interests of Canada to remain in the coalition?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I would say is that it is -- first of all, that\'s a decision for Prime Minister Trudeau to make. \xc2\xa0He can -- he was elected based on his ability to make that kind of assessment. \xc2\xa0And my understanding from what I\'ve read about some of the coverage of the campaign is that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t suggesting withdrawing from all of Canada\xe2\x80\x99s important commitments to our counter-ISIL efforts, but I know that he did raise some concerns about some of those contributions. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that will be part of the conversation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Very last question. \xc2\xa0This operation, this support to the Kurdish forces in Sinjar, is it just the U.S.-backed air support, or the coalition is involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense who can give you an operational update about who exactly carried out those airstrikes. \xc2\xa0I\'m confident that the vast majority of them were carried out by the United States. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know to what extent other countries may have been involved.</p>\n<p>\n\tJon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When is the President going to sign the NDAA? \xc2\xa0And I assume there will be full coverage, or what\xe2\x80\x99s the coverage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Last I heard, Jon, is we haven\'t received that legislation, the bill from Congress yet. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll keep you updated on when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to sign it. \xc2\xa0I can\'t promise in advance that there will be coverage, but we\'ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\'re leaning that way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not leaning one way or the other at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tTuluse, we\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It sounds like from what Ambassador Rice said that you all are sort of pushing back on the idea that Putin has a more influential stance at this G20 at this time of year compared to last time. \xc2\xa0And I\'m wondering if that\'s the U.S. position. \xc2\xa0It sounds like in the response to the question about whether or not the President would meet with him that he met -- they met about six weeks ago. \xc2\xa0So I\'m kind of wondering what your position is on whether or not Putin has a more influential position on the global stage today versus last year.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Toluse, I think the best way to consider that question is actually just to take a look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0When the President meets with our closest allies in Europe -- the UK, France, Germany and Italy -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll be having a conversation about what all of our countries are doing to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s counter-ISIL strategy. \xc2\xa0When the President does his bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau that will be a topic of conversation. \xc2\xa0When the President meets with President Erdogan that will be a topic of conversation in terms of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing contribution to the counter-ISIL effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it will be fairly evident to those who are tracking the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, as all of you will be, that he\xe2\x80\x99s playing a leading role in mobilizing the world\xe2\x80\x99s response to the threat that is posed by ISIL. \xc2\xa0There just aren\xe2\x80\x99t that many countries that are working with Russia in that regard, and those that are aren\xe2\x80\x99t invited to the G20 meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that is an indication of the way that the world is responding and how Russia stands alone as they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get some attention for their efforts. \xc2\xa0And frankly, the concern that\xe2\x80\x99s been raised about Russian activity is that there is an internal, fundamental contradiction to their strategy, that President Putin likes to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s quite concerned about ISIL and that his military actions are focused on ISIL, but the fact is, the result of his military efforts and the result of his political efforts have only been to build up the Assad regime, which only sets back the likelihood of the kind of political transition that even Mr. Putin himself says is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo his failure to resolve that basic, fundamental, internal contribution -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- contradiction -- in his thinking has isolated him. \xc2\xa0And again, I think that will be on display at the G20 meeting and in the context of other elements of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Susan Rice said that it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that they may talk on the sidelines. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how that conversation may differ from the meeting they had back in September, given what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the time since. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Russia bombing U.S.-backed rebels on the ground in Syria. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the plane that went down, potentially shot down by ISIS. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen these talks start in Vienna with Russia at the table. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the President\xe2\x80\x99s message is going to be and how it may be different from about six weeks ago when they met and all of those things hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the conversation will be shorter, if there is one over the course of this week, than it was back in September. \xc2\xa0But the message and strategy that President Obama has laid out has been quite consistent. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if this issue of the fundamental contradiction in the Russian strategy is at least a topic of some discussion. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge the conversation before it happens, if it happens, but if it does, we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to give you a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just one more on the South China Sea -- a quick follow-up. \xc2\xa0There seems to be some debate over whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be part of the official agenda. \xc2\xa0Will the U.S. sort of push to put down the official agenda at the East Asia Summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be listed on the official agenda at those meetings, but I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that it will be a subject of prominent discussion among the world leaders who are gathered there. \xc2\xa0And while the United States, of course, makes no claim in the South China Sea, we are quite concerned about protecting freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage all parties, big and small, to resolve their differences diplomatically and to not try to use their comparative size and strength to intimidate their neighbors in that region of the world; that resolving these differences of opinion through diplomacy and fairly around the negotiating table serves the interest of all parties involved, including China. \xc2\xa0China has a significant stake in protecting the free flow of commerce in the South China Sea, as they, I understand, have even previously acknowledged. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the result that we\xe2\x80\x99re after. \xc2\xa0And again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it will be on the formal agenda, but it certainly will be on the minds and lips of the world leaders who are attending the meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:37 P.M.
