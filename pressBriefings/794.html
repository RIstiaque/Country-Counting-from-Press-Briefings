ICT</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon. \xc2\xa0Thanks for joining us here today in Phonm Penh. \xc2\xa0As you know, the President has had some bilats this morning and some other meetings that he\xe2\x80\x99s participating in.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI have Ben Rhodes, Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, who can give you an overview of the President\xe2\x80\x99s day and also can answer questions about the meetings, about the trip, and other matters. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m here to take questions on non-foreign policy related issues, if you have any.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd with that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over the Ben.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, before you begin, there\xe2\x80\x99s a break in the story about the Secretary of State going to Israel. \xc2\xa0Can you confirm that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll address it, Mark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll address that right ahead.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Okay, first of all, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just give a quick update of the President\xe2\x80\x99s meetings this morning and then an update on the situation in Gaza. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe first meeting the President had this morning was with the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries that are in attendance here at the summit. \xc2\xa0The countries reviewed the progress that has been made in negotiations over the course of the last year. \xc2\xa0They also discussed the countries that have come into the TPP. \xc2\xa0Canada and Mexico have joined; Japan and Thailand have expressed an interest in joining. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re committed to getting those negotiations concluded with an aim to doing so next year so that they can complete that trade agreement.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThen the President, as you saw, met with Prime Minister Noda of Japan. \xc2\xa0They reviewed the bilateral security cooperation that we do through our alliance. \xc2\xa0They discussed regional issues, including maritime security and some of the territorial disputes associated with that. \xc2\xa0And they addressed Japan and its aspirations to join the TPP, and agreed to continue negotiations towards an achievement of that goal, which we believe would strengthen the TPP and be good for both Japan and the United States.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThen the President met with Premier Wen Jiabao of China. \xc2\xa0This was the last meeting that the two leaders will have, given Wen Jiabao\xe2\x80\x99s moving out of that role next year. \xc2\xa0They discussed the importance of the U.S. and China consistently maintaining our cooperation on a bilateral, regional, and global level. \xc2\xa0They discussed security issues, including Iran. \xc2\xa0They discussed economic issues, including our commitment to strengthen the rules of the road in the global economy. \xc2\xa0And they discussed regional stability, reaffirming that China is a part of our engagement here in this important region -- a critical part of that engagement; and our interest, again, in resolving territorial disputes and maritime disputes consistent with international rules of the road.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tA couple of things on Gaza. \xc2\xa0Last night, we read out to you, the President after leaving the dinner called President Morsi of Egypt and then Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. \xc2\xa0He reaffirmed our belief that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for there to be a de-escalation in the region, one that brings an end to rocket fire into Israeli cities. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd then later that night, the President spoke to President Morsi again to discuss Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s constructive role in seeking to bring about a de-escalation in the region.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThen, to Mark\xe2\x80\x99s question, this morning, Secretary Clinton and the President spoke about the situation in Gaza and the calls that he\xe2\x80\x99d done, and they agreed that it makes sense for the Secretary to travel to the region. \xc2\xa0So Secretary Clinton will depart today and she\xe2\x80\x99ll travel to Jerusalem, Ramallah, and Cairo, leaving from Phonm Penh. \xc2\xa0And she\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with regional leaders, beginning with our Israeli partners, to consult on the situation in Gaza.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHer visits will build on the engagement that we\'ve undertaken over the last several days, including the engagement by President Obama and Secretary Clinton with leaders in the region to support a de-escalation of the violence and a durable outcome that ends the rocket attacks on Israeli cities and restores a broader calm in the region. \xc2\xa0Again, as President Obama noted in his conversation with President Morsi, we commend Egypt\'s efforts to de-escalate the situation, and are hopeful that they will be successful. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tOn her trip, Secretary Clinton will emphasize the United States\' interest in a peaceful outcome that protects and enhances Israel\'s security and regional stability -- an outcome that can lead to improved conditions for the civilian residents of Gaza, and that could reopen the path to fulfill the aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis for two states living side by side in peace and security. \xc2\xa0And, of course, she will continue to express our concern about the loss of civilian life on both sides.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd with that, I\'ll take your questions. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJim.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Ben. \xc2\xa0Regarding Gaza and Israel, you\'ve said that the precipitating incidents in this was rocket fire coming from Gaza. \xc2\xa0What is that Secretary Clinton can take to the region? \xc2\xa0What can she offer to Hamas to provide incentives to make them stop doing this? \xc2\xa0And then could you also talk in more detail about any discussions on East China Sea disputes and South China Sea disputes, and how to resolve those?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, sure. \xc2\xa0On your first question, the reason there is a conflict in Gaza is because of the rocket fire that\xe2\x80\x99s been launched at Israeli civilians indiscriminately for many months now. \xc2\xa0And any solution to this challenge has to include an end to that rocket fire. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAt the same time, I think we all agree that the best way to solve this is through diplomacy so that you have a peaceful settlement that ends that rocket fire and allows for a broader calm in the region.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo what we\'ve been doing is working with our Israeli partners to reinforce our close cooperation on security matters and our support for their right to defend themselves, but also to work with countries like Egypt that have relationships with the Palestinians so that they may use that influence and those relationships to encourage a de-escalation. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we want to broaden those discussions as we move forward with Secretary Clinton going to the region so that we can build on the constructive role that Egypt is playing and send a clear message that it\'s in nobody\'s interest to see an escalation of the military conflict.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo again, she will be speaking to Israelis, and her first stop will be in Israel, where she will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reinforce our close cooperation. \xc2\xa0Then she\'ll be meeting with Palestinians in Ramallah, and she will be meeting with Egyptian leaders in Cairo. \xc2\xa0And again, the goal throughout that trip is for everybody to use their influence and their voices to encourage a peaceful outcome rather than an escalation. \xc2\xa0But again, our bottom line is that peaceful outcome has to include an end to rocket fire that threatens Israel.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith respect to the East China Sea, our view is that there needs to be a lowering of tension around these territorial disputes. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to risk any potential escalation, particularly when you have two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest economies -- China and Japan -- associated with some of those disputes. \xc2\xa0So again, I think President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s message is there needs to be a reduction of the tensions in the East China Sea and a process going forward, more broadly, to ensure that these types of disputes don\xe2\x80\x99t risk escalation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does it help that tension, though, if there are U.S. \xc2\xa0-- if the U.S. is participating in Japan military exercises?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, it helps, we believe, the regional security and regional stability to have the United States, as a cornerstone of our engagement in the region, maintain its close alliance with Japan. \xc2\xa0We believe that the alliance we have and the military cooperation we have with Japan has been an anchor of stability in Asia for decades, and has helped, by the way, create the context that has allowed for broader prosperity and the peaceful rise of China. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we believe our cooperation with Japan is essential to Japan\xe2\x80\x99s security, but it is also constructive in ensuring that this part of the world maintains the type of stability that has allowed it to have such economic growth.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tChuck.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Who is she meeting with in Ramallah? \xc2\xa0Is she just meeting with Abbas and members of Fatah, or is she meeting with some member of Hamas?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll allow the State Department to speak to the specifics of her schedule beyond her first meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu. \xc2\xa0I can assure you that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with the Palestinian Authority. \xc2\xa0The United States does not engage directly with Hamas. \xc2\xa0Hamas has not met the conditions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve set for many years -- to renounce terrorism, to recognize Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist, and to abide by preexisting agreements. \xc2\xa0So we do not engage directly with Hamas.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Look, the Palestinian Authority is the leadership of the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0President Abbas is the elected leader of the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0So they are a critical voice in this -- in these matters, both as it relates to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Gaza and our efforts going forward to improve the situation in Gaza, but also in terms of our broader efforts to pursue peace between the Israelis and Palestinians.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we believe that President Abbas and the Palestinian Authority are critical partners in our efforts in the region, and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to reaffirm that with her visit.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is this essentially an attempt to send the message that the U.S. is trying to play the role of mediator here?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0What we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing is working with a number of countries to play the role in supporting a de-escalation. \xc2\xa0So her trip is building on the discussions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had over the course of the last several days, again, with President Morsi of Egypt, with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey. \xc2\xa0The Secretary has been in touch with Ban Ki-moon, who is also traveling to the region, as well as a number of her counterparts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo this will extend those consultations. \xc2\xa0And what we hope for is enough support in the region and internationally for a de-escalation, for an end to rocket fire, that can provide for calm and avoid an escalation of a very difficult challenge in Gaza.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When does she leave?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s leaving from Phnom Penh, so she\xe2\x80\x99s leaving here later today. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact time, but she\xe2\x80\x99ll be leaving from the summit. \xc2\xa0And again, the President and Secretary Clinton have been talking about the situation throughout the trip. \xc2\xa0They spoke about it last night. \xc2\xa0Then, after the President\xe2\x80\x99s calls late last night, he met with Secretary Clinton this morning and was able to update her on his calls and to discuss the way forward. \xc2\xa0And then, throughout the day at the summit site, the two of them were in discussions along with Tom Donilon, the National Security Advisor, who has also been talking to his counterparts. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd again, we believe that the best way to advance the discussions we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with leaders in the region is for Secretary Clinton to take this trip, beginning with our close partner, Israel.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But then what leverage does she bring? \xc2\xa0What leverage does the U.S. have other than trying to gather support of other players? \xc2\xa0There have been a lot of non-negotiable demands from Hamas.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Look, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a matter of leverage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of what\xe2\x80\x99s in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s best interest. \xc2\xa0It is not in the interest of the Palestinians and the people of Gaza for there to be an escalation of this conflict. \xc2\xa0That would bring with it a huge cost. \xc2\xa0As the President said the other day, we believe Israel has the right to defend itself. \xc2\xa0Israel will make decisions about its own security. \xc2\xa0At the same time, if we can achieve the goal of an end to rocket fire peacefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly preferable, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a view that\xe2\x80\x99s shared by Israelis and by leaders in the region.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I think what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake here is whether or not we can come together, and again, see leaders take decisions to support a de-escalation that ultimately can avert a greater loss of life from what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the previous several days.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ben, if you were able to characterize how effective Morsi has been so far, how would you characterize the way he\xe2\x80\x99s handled the situation?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0The President and the Secretary believe that the Egyptians have been quite constructive in the conversations we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with them; that they have expressed a sincere commitment to support a de-escalation here. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s important now is to continue to pursue that course, to use the influence that they have over the situation to encourage that course.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo to date, we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by the cooperation and the consultation we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the Egyptian leadership. \xc2\xa0We want to see that support, a process that can de-escalate the situation. \xc2\xa0But again, the bottom line still remains that Hamas has to stop this rocket fire. \xc2\xa0So ultimately, they\xe2\x80\x99re the ones who are going to have to be a part of a solution that ends the type of terror that Israeli citizens have faced over so many months with this barrage of rockets coming into Israeli territory.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is Morsi more effective than Mubarak has been in the past, would you say? \xc2\xa0Is that fair to characterize?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw comparisons at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this has been a conflict that has been going on for decades. \xc2\xa0Egypt has been a critical part of our effort to manage that conflict and pursue peace. \xc2\xa0That was the case under President Mubarak. \xc2\xa0It continues to be the case under President Morsi, who has upheld the peace treaty with Israel. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is, again, our engagement has been focused on practical and constructive cooperation that can reduce tensions, but ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be Hamas within Gaza that takes a step of not pursuing rocket fire on Israeli territory. \xc2\xa0But we believe that Egypt can and should be a partner in seeking to bring about that outcome.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the ground in Egypt, Morsi is getting a lot of feedback -- pushback, that the people in Egypt are saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not being aggressive enough over this train situation. \xc2\xa0Do you think domestic politics will affect his -- while he negotiates?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0First of all, in the call last night with President Morsi, President Obama did express condolences for what was an awful train wreck that took the lives of dozens of people, including many children, and President Morsi is of course focused on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think as it relates to the suffering of the people in Gaza, though, our message to everybody -- the Egyptians, the Palestinians, other regional and international partners -- is that the suffering that they are facing will only increase if this conflict increases. \xc2\xa0So therefore, those who have the best interest of the people of Gaza at heart will want to see an end to this conflict and a de-escalation of this conflict. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAs the President said the other day, any escalation of the military conflict would only bring about greater suffering and loss of life on both the Israeli and Palestinian side. \xc2\xa0So that should be the basis for people to come together and avoid that outcome. \xc2\xa0And again, the only way you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have that outcome is if the precipitating factor of this conflict -- the rocket fire -- comes to an end.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ben, you keep using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cde-escalate the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Are you avoiding using the word \xe2\x80\x9cceasefire\xe2\x80\x9d?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0No, I mean, there are many ways that you can achieve the goal of a de-escalation. \xc2\xa0Again, what our bottom line is, is an end to rocket fire. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re open to any number of ideas for achieving that goal. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed any number of ideas for accomplishing that goal. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to begin with a reduction of tensions and space created for the situation to calm. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing going forward, as we have been over the last several days, what are the various ways in which we can accomplish that goal.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a question about the Japanese bilat. \xc2\xa0First, my understanding is that it was scheduled for 40 minutes but it ended up being only 25 minutes. \xc2\xa0Why is that? \xc2\xa0Second, on TPP, the Prime Minister today, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to announce an official decision by Japan to join the negotiations. \xc2\xa0Were you hoping for the official decision today, and are you disappointed? \xc2\xa0And last, can you give me a sense of how much of the conversation revolved around the Senkaku Islands? \xc2\xa0And what was the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to Prime Minister Noda?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0On the Senkakus? \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, on the time, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of exactly how long it was. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this was on the margins of a summit, so you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to -- you\xe2\x80\x99re not able to have kind of an open-ended discussion. \xc2\xa0But my understanding is that it was a good and friendly discussion between the two leaders. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith respect to the TPP, we did not have an expectation that there would be some final agreement today. \xc2\xa0There are still a number of issues at play. \xc2\xa0And as I said, we very much welcome Japan\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the TPP. \xc2\xa0We think they could contribute a lot to the agreement. \xc2\xa0And I think we want to continue those negotiations going forward. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThere are issues, again, that we\xe2\x80\x99re interested in like autos, where we want to make sure that American automakers have access to Japanese markets and have a level playing field both here in the United States and in Japan. \xc2\xa0We know that there are issues that are of interest to the Japanese as well. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue our discussions around those issues with the goal very much being Japan coming into the TPP. \xc2\xa0And we commend Prime Minister Noda\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in supporting that outcome.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith respect to the Senkakus, again, it came up; it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t discussed extensively. \xc2\xa0Our message was that we support our close friend and ally, Japan, and we believe, however, the best way to deal with the situation going forward is to avoid a potential escalation, a potential misunderstanding that could lead to an escalation. \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the interest of China, Japan, the United States, and the region to see a reduction of tensions around that issue as well.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On China\xe2\x80\x99s -- on Iran, could you elaborate on that a little bit more?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, I think they were just -- they were reviewing, given that this was Premier Wen\xe2\x80\x99s last meeting with the President, they were reviewing a number of the issues that they\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on together over the last four years. \xc2\xa0One of them is Iran sanctions. \xc2\xa0And so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so much a discussion about specific issues as much as it was a reiteration of that fact that we have had cooperation from the Chinese on issues like Iran sanctions. \xc2\xa0We need to maintain that cooperation going forward, particularly in our sanctions regime, because we share the goal of diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of that discussion.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tLaura.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0On the South China Sea issue, it looks like what\'s happening is that China is saying that there has been an agreement not to "internationalize the issue;" presumably, that means deal with it in a forum like the East Asia Summit. \xc2\xa0The Philippines and other countries are saying, no, we don\xe2\x80\x99t, we haven\'t -- don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agreement along those lines. \xc2\xa0What is the U.S. understanding of the state of play on this issue? \xc2\xa0And is this something that President Obama plans to -- has already brought up or plans to bring up?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I think what we\'ve seen for a period of time now is a belief by the United States that there needs to be a process to discuss issues associated with maritime security in the South China Sea, and that the forums like the East Asia Summit are important for that. \xc2\xa0Because these need to be discussed in a multilateral context so that we can reaffirm the principles of maritime security that can guide the resolution to something like the South China Sea.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo for instance, the U.S. believes that any solution has to be consistent with international law, has to preserve the free flow of commerce that is important not just to the countries in this region but to the world. \xc2\xa0The U.S. is not a claimant in the South China Sea, but we have significant interest there given its role in the global economy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe also want to see continued momentum on a diplomatic process. \xc2\xa0So for instance, ASEAN has been talking to China about a code of conduct that could help avoid misunderstandings, escalations within the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the type of diplomatic effort that needs to maintain momentum going forward.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the President will raise this, certainly, in the East Asia Summit. \xc2\xa0We expect other leaders to raise it at the East Asia Summit as well. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why we feel like it\'s so important to engage in international architecture like this in this region -- because as all these countries grow, as there are issues that need to be resolved associated with the rapid growth of these countries, you need to have forums where you can come together to address them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we put the issue of maritime security on the agenda last year, along with many other countries, and we expect that to be a sustained process with ASEAN, with China, and through the EAS. \xc2\xa0And what that can do is create the context for a resolution through diplomacy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I expect we\'ll raise it here. \xc2\xa0I expect other countries will. \xc2\xa0And we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s a very positive and constructive step going forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So what\'s the current state of play right now in terms of -- my understanding is that Cambodia, as the host, has some control over what is and isn\'t dealt with at the summit. \xc2\xa0Could you just explain how that all works?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0First of all, I think the current state of play, more broadly, is that last year you saw a lot of countries come forward -- the vast majority of countries in this region -- and address maritime security in the South China Sea at the EAS. \xc2\xa0Since then, that\xe2\x80\x99s created space for diplomatic efforts like negotiation of a code of conduct and a set of other discussions. \xc2\xa0Here in Cambodia, the Cambodians of course have a degree of say over the agenda and what the product of the summit is, but at the same time, nations can bring to the table whatever they want. \xc2\xa0And we very much expect that nations will bring to the table maritime security and the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0And with ASEAN, we discussed maritime security as well, and there\'s a significant interest in ASEAN to see maritime security stay on the agenda in these forums going forward. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo it\'s certainly going to be the case that it\'s on the agenda here. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly going to be the case that we\'re going to have a number of partners who are committed to seeing that there\'s a diplomatic process for resolving these conflicts consistent with international rules of the road, rather than leaving it to bilateral discussions between individual nations. \xc2\xa0We think that\'s not the way to resolve the issues in the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0We believe that these need to be done consistent with international law and discussed in multilateral fora.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ben, it\'s been observed this week that right as the President and the administration is trying to show, again, that it\'s interested in pivoting to Asia, that events in the Middle East again have, again, sort of raised its head and sort of in some ways overshadowed or at least -- part of the message here. \xc2\xa0Does that raise any -- can you comment on whether that raises any risk about sort of so publicly saying we\'re sort of pivoting to this direction? \xc2\xa0Is it hard to sort of leave the focus on one or do you do both?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0At the risk of having a double metaphor with a pivot, we believe that the United States can walk and chew gum at the same time. \xc2\xa0And I think you saw evidence of that the last few days, where you had a truly historic visit by the President of the United States to Burma and a clear indication from both the government and people of that country that they want to move in a democratic direction and they want a deeper relationship with us, which we believe can be a tremendous step forward both for the advance of democracy but also for a very important relationship that the United States could have with Burma going forward.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that is a significant thing that we\'ll take away from this trip, even as throughout the last several days the President, the Secretary -- Tom Donilon were in touch with counterparts on the situation in Gaza. \xc2\xa0You know the pivot, in many respects, reflects not just the time that we\'re spending here -- which is significant -- but it\'s also resource allocation. \xc2\xa0And so much of our resources the last 10 years have been in Iraq, principally, and then Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd so as those resources are dramatically reduced, that not only creates time and space for the President and other senior officials, it allows for us to do things like prioritize our security presence in this region; prioritize our economic engagement in this region; and prioritize our support for democracy and human rights in this region, which was such an important part of this trip as well. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we\'ll continue to move forward with our pivot, even as we\'ll manage the inevitable crises and challenges that will come up in other regions. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJessica.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to Israel and Gaza, a couple of questions; if you mentioned it, I missed it -- with whom is she meeting in Egypt? \xc2\xa0What role are you looking for Turkey to play? \xc2\xa0It sounds like you\'re asking them to play a more involved role, and why isn\'t she meeting there as well? \xc2\xa0And more broadly speaking, are you asking Israel -- what does the end game look like? \xc2\xa0Have you encouraged them to think about it? \xc2\xa0And can you describe to us what a ramp down would look like for them?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, first of all, I just want to leave it to the State Department to fill in the details for a schedule. \xc2\xa0We obviously just took the decision to pursue this trip as coming out of the engagements that the President and Secretary have had over the course of the last several days. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe know she\'ll meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel. \xc2\xa0We know she\'ll meet with the Palestinian Authority leadership, presumably in Ramallah. \xc2\xa0And then in Cairo, she\'ll meet with a range of Egyptian leaders. \xc2\xa0They\'ll have updates on her schedule.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think with respect to Turkey, we do believe that they are another country, like Egypt, that has influence with Hamas, with the Palestinians. \xc2\xa0The President has spoken to Prime Minister Erdogan. \xc2\xa0One of the people that Secretary Clinton has been in touch with the last several days is Foreign Minister Davuto\xc4\x9flu of Turkey. \xc2\xa0So she\'ll continue to be in touch with the Turks. \xc2\xa0And they too are a part of this effort, an international effort to encourage a de-escalation.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn terms of what that would look like, our belief is, in the short term, that has to involve an end to rocket fire and also a restoration of calm within Gaza. \xc2\xa0And that\'s necessary to create space to have a broader discussion about the fundamental issues at stake. \xc2\xa0Ultimately, what we want to achieve is two states living side by side in peace and security. \xc2\xa0And that is going to be much harder to achieve if you\'re going to have conflicts like what we\'ve seen in Gaza, which make it that much more difficult to pursue what is already an incredibly difficult challenge. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we need to walk through the door here of restoring calm to the region, and then address some of the underlying challenges both within Gaza, where of course we\'ve worked to support progress in the humanitarian situation there as well as an end to terror and rocket fire, but then also more generally getting back on a track towards the peace that we\'ve been seeking for so many years.\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Ben, is the administration specifically asking Prime Minister Netanyahu to hold off on any ground invasion while all these efforts are underway, while the diplomatic initiative begins?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0As we\'ve said, we think Israel has the right to defend itself. \xc2\xa0We think that Israel will make its own decisions about the military operations and decisions that it undertakes. \xc2\xa0However, at the same time, we believe that Israelis -- like the United States, like other countries -- would prefer to see their interest met diplomatically and peacefully. \xc2\xa0As the President said the other day, an Israeli operation of that nature would bring with a great cost to Palestinians in Gaza, but also to Israelis, because inevitably it would involve Israelis casualties. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we want to support the goals that Israel has. \xc2\xa0We share the goals that Israel has. \xc2\xa0And we and the Israelis both believe that if you can achieve those goals peacefully, that\xe2\x80\x99s preferable. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to make their own decisions about what they need to do to defend themselves, and we believe that they have every right to defend their citizens from the threat of these rockets coming in. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd in addition to that, as they do, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to provide them with the type of support that we have with the Iron Dome system, which has been quite effective in protecting Israeli citizens from incoming rocket fire.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you be more specific about whether the President has asked them to hold off on an invasion?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0MR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0No, the President has been very clear that Israel is going to make its own security decisions. \xc2\xa0Again, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the basic fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s just common sense that if you can achieve those goals diplomatically, that would be in everybody\xe2\x80\x99s interest. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut again, our bottom line from the beginning has been that we understand that Israel has a right to defend itself, and ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make their decisions about how to do that. \xc2\xa0But if you step back and if you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of the Palestinian people, the Israeli people and the region, it\xe2\x80\x99s a restoration of calm and not an escalation of the conflict.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We have just time for one or two more. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more question about the Senkakus. \xc2\xa0Am I understanding correct that President Obama raised this issue in a discussion with the Japanese leader and the Chinese leader? \xc2\xa0And secondly, could you tell us what was the reaction of the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0The reaction of Premier Wen on the Senkakus? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that that issue came up in the meeting with Premier Wen. \xc2\xa0I think that the President and Premier Wen had a broader discussion about maritime security and the need to resolve disputes involved with maritime security peacefully. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWith Prime Minister Noda, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of who raised the issue. \xc2\xa0But this is something we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to our Japanese allies about for some time now. \xc2\xa0Again, our baseline is we, of course, are fully committed to Japan and its security -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the cornerstone of our alliance. \xc2\xa0We just believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s in Japan\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s in China\xe2\x80\x99s interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s in the world\xe2\x80\x99s interest that the second and third largest economies in the world are able to reduce tensions around this issue. \xc2\xa0So we ultimately think that that\xe2\x80\x99s a good outcome for Japan.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think in light of the crisis that it\'s possible that Secretary Clinton might stay on longer? \xc2\xa0That the President might want her to change her timeline?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I have not heard any discussion of Secretary Clinton staying on longer. \xc2\xa0I think that, obviously, right now we\'re dealing with an urgent challenge; with a window where we\'re trying to affect the situation in our discussions with countries in the region. And she has, of course, been an important part of that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI think stepping back, what you saw on this trip was a recognition of the fact that this is the last trip that she will be on with the President. \xc2\xa0And I was talking to him earlier today about the emotion around that, the discussions around that, and you obviously saw his comments in Rangoon. \xc2\xa0And he was intent, for instance, on bringing her down the front steps of Air Force One when it made the historic landing there. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tHe also said that on the flight back from Rangoon to Cambodia, they spent basically the entire flight alone in his personal office on Air Force One just reminiscing about the last four years. \xc2\xa0But, as the President said, it wasn\'t just the last four years; they have been through a lot together over the last five or six years. \xc2\xa0And, in fact, unique among people, they have been at this, working as hard as they can, for five or six years now.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd I think what the President expresses and what he believes is not only has she done a great job as Secretary of State, but they\'ve really come to become not just partners but close friends. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a friendship that he values very much and that he will want to continue going forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut right now there is urgent business to be done. \xc2\xa0And as they were reminiscing they were also talking about the situation in Gaza and the international challenges that remain. \xc2\xa0So we will be in, I\'m sure, very close touch with her as she moves on to the Middle East in the coming days.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0This is the last one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0One more. \xc2\xa0Jessica.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just get a sense -- where you feel the stance? \xc2\xa0Are you guys getting any traction from Egypt on what the parameters for a ceasefire would be?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0We have been -- what we think is that the Egyptians are sincere in their belief that it will be -- it would be the best outcome for there to be a de-escalation. \xc2\xa0We have had discussions with them about the nature of a de-escalation, what the ideas are that could advance that goal. \xc2\xa0We have also been talking to the Israelis, obviously, at every step of the way so that we are fully coordinated with them. \xc2\xa0Many other regional players have been involved; the U.N. Secretary General is going there tomorrow. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo there are a number of ideas that are at play. \xc2\xa0I\'m not going to get into the details of them.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you share any?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0I think if you step back, it\'s not that complicated. \xc2\xa0I mean, there needs to be, in the first instance, an end to the rocket fire and a restoration of calm. \xc2\xa0That can create space for a range of discussions that address issues associated with the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo what is encouraging is we believe that leaders understand what the best outcome would be here. \xc2\xa0However, you can only achieve that goal if Hamas takes action to stop what they have been doing. \xc2\xa0So even if you have support from these regional leaders, ultimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to have an effect on the ground on Hamas because they are the ones who precipitated this conflict with their continued rocket fire into Israel.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And Ben, could you tell me -- is she going because talks are stuck? \xc2\xa0Or is she going because you think you\'re close?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Well, she\'s going because we have been in discussions with these leaders and we want to carry those forward. \xc2\xa0And obviously, the center of gravity for those discussions is in the region. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to do a lot of work on the phone. \xc2\xa0He was on the phone until 2:30 in the morning last night; he left dinner and basically dealt with this for several hours. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd so he will continue to reach out to his counterparts. \xc2\xa0But she is going to go out there to be in the region, to have direct face-to-face discussions with those leaders. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict exactly what the outcome of those discussions will be. \xc2\xa0We all know how difficult the situation is. \xc2\xa0We all know how charged the issue of Gaza is; we have seen conflict there in the past. \xc2\xa0So this is a difficult challenge.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut again, it\'s worth the effort of leaders in the United States, in the region, and internationally to try to bring about the preferred outcome here which is a peaceful de-escalation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Thanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We have to -- we\'re going to miss the plane, guys.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What can they do, really, at this point? \xc2\xa0It\'s really all about Gaza. \xc2\xa0Abbas has no power with Hamas in the Gaza strip, so what can they --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. RHODES: \xc2\xa0Look, obviously the Palestinian Authority as elected leaders of the Palestinian people need to be a part of this discussion, just broadly. \xc2\xa0Specifically, in Gaza, they are going to need to be a part of the solution in the long term in terms of the goals that we all share in improving the humanitarian situation there, having greater opportunity for the people there and having an end to terrorism there.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo we believe that it\'s very important that the Palestinian Authority continue to be a part of these discussions. \xc2\xa0They have legitimacy to be a part of these discussions, and they are clearly going to play a role in the future of the Palestinian people -- and a leading role. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Thank you all very much. \xc2\xa0Appreciate it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t3:05 P.M. ICT</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
