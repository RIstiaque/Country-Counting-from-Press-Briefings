Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:48 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the response.\xc2\xa0 Fired-up crowd for Friday afternoon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me do a couple of announcements before we get to the -- let me tee these up here and make sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve got them.\xc2\xa0 I just want to give you a readout of a couple of meetings that the President has had the last 18 hours or so on a couple of different topics.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBuilding on the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enhance safe American energy production and respond to the threat of climate change, the President yesterday -- last evening -- convened a meeting with business and thought leaders from the clean energy sector to discuss ongoing priorities.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDuring the meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to a cleaner and more secure energy future.\xc2\xa0 The discussion covered a variety of topics, including the important role of natural gas in our domestic energy portfolio; new opportunities for renewables like wind, solar, and advanced biofuels; the importance of clean energy research and development; as well as the promise and potential of increased energy efficiency in our homes and businesses.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSince the President took office, responsible domestic oil and gas production has increased each year.\xc2\xa0 Energy production from renewable resources like wind and solar has more than doubled.\xc2\xa0 Emissions of carbon pollution have decreased.\xc2\xa0 And our nation has dramatically reduced its imports of foreign oil.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President made clear that his administration will build on this historic progress using tools, including existing authorities across the federal government and leveraging public-private partnerships to achieve key energy and climate objectives in his second term.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to working with these clean energy leaders and others toward that shared goal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, to that end, on Friday, March 15th -- one week from today -- the President will travel to Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois for an event focused on American energy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel early next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you just say -- is the President planning to talk about sequester cuts while he\xe2\x80\x99s there, or is this totally focused on energy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This will be focused primarily on energy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, a couple of -- you have also asked about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting on immigration reform today.\xc2\xa0 Let me give you a brief readout of that meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAlso earlier today, the President, joined by members of his senior staff, met with leaders from the faith community to discuss the need for Congress to swiftly act and pass common-sense immigration reform in a bipartisan manner.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated his strong commitment to a pathway to earned citizenship for undocumented immigrants, as well as his administration\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on cracking down on employers who exploit vulnerable immigrant workers and undermine -- let me say that again -- who exploit vulnerable immigrant workers and undermine American workers, and continuing to strengthen our border security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President thanked the leaders for their work on the issue, and he looks forward to working with them to move the immigration debate forward in Congress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne last thing that I learned about this morning that I thought you all might be interested in.\xc2\xa0 As you now know, Vice President Biden swore in the new Director of the Central Intelligence Agency today, John Brennan.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s one piece of this that I wanted to note for you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Director Brennan was sworn in with his hand on an original draft of the Constitution that had George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s personal handwriting and annotations on it, dating from 1787.\xc2\xa0 Brennan had requested a document from the National Archives that would symbolize that the United States is a nation of laws.\xc2\xa0 And before he was sworn in, Director Brennan told the President that he made the request to the Archives because he wanted to reaffirm his commitment to the rule of law as he took the oath of office as Director of the CIA.\xc2\xa0 So I thought that was an interesting piece of color that might interest all of you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So with that long windup, Julie, I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken all the pressure off your first question.\xc2\xa0 You can begin.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, great.\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess my first thing would be just to request that the meetings, like the energy meeting, be put on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, as well as his meeting with the Jewish leaders.\xc2\xa0 That was left off yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Since the immigration meeting today was put on, if we could have some consistency with that it would be appreciated.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we make those decisions on a case-by-case basis, but your interest in that is duly noted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask a couple questions about Abu Ghaith, bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman.\xc2\xa0 Why is he being tried in a civilian court?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the simple answer to that question is that there is broad consensus across the United States government.\xc2\xa0 At the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community agrees that the best way to protect our national security interests is to prosecute Abu Ghaith in an Article 3 court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a pretty strong track record of the success of Article 3 courts in handling these kinds of trials.\xc2\xa0 Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber, was tried in an Article 3 court.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s currently serving a life sentence.\xc2\xa0 Abdulmutallab, also known as the \xe2\x80\x9cunderwear bomber,\xe2\x80\x9d faces similar fate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Article 3 courts have shown that they are, in many ways, a more efficient way for us to deliver justice to those who seek to harm the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 And that is the consensus view of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team and of agencies all across the federal government that this is the best way to handle bringing Abu Ghaith to justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So going forward, when we have similar circumstances, is this going to be the track that the President will take?\xc2\xa0 Or is this still going to be specific to depending on the conditions around how these people are captured, what types of activity they may have been involved in?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly, these kinds of cases will be handled on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 But as the President has articulated himself many times, it\xe2\x80\x99s his view that whenever we can use Article 3 courts to get justice, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do so.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, they\xe2\x80\x99ve proved to be a very useful tool in getting that justice, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why and how the decision was made in this case.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you know if the President reached out, or anyone from the administration reached out to Mayor Bloomberg before making this decision?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any conversations with Mayor Bloomberg in advance of this decision having been made.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Matt.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that quickly, Mitch McConnell suggested that the decision to try bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law would actually impede intelligence collection, and that it would be better for him to have been taken to Guantanamo and safer for all involved.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 With all due respect to Senator McConnell, that\'s not the assessment of the intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the assessment of the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the assessment of the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly welcome to his opinion, but that\'s not the assessment of the people who are responsible for protecting the national security of the United States of America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that to say that they feel like they already exhausted whatever intelligence leads they might get from him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, for additional details, if they are available, they can be provided by the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that it is customary in these circumstances for questioning of the detained individual to take place, and that happened in this case.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of -- well, I guess I should also point out that there have been previous detainees who have been subject to similar questioning in similar circumstances that has yielded valuable intelligence.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about in the past.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice for details about this circumstance.\xc2\xa0 But this is something that has been -- this is a process that has been tried before and has a very strong track record of success.\xc2\xa0 And it was the unanimous view of the national security community and the intelligence community that it should be pursued in this case as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and one last question on the budget.\xc2\xa0 Pentagon officials have told the House Armed Services Committee that the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget is coming on April 8th.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 And what, if any, concern does the administration have that the Senate and House versions are going to be rolled out before the administration\xe2\x80\x99s budget?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a budget date to announce to you.\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about for some time, the budget has been delayed because of some of the impediments, frankly, to formulating a budget that have been thrown in the path of those who are working on it.\xc2\xa0 We had a fiscal cliff debate that lasted through the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, the implementation of the sequester has affected the ability of the administration to put together our budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s something that people are hard at work on, and I think in the coming weeks we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details about the budget.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what that budget will show is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s top policy priority is strengthening our economy for the middle class; that we want to make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re putting the policies in place that will strengthen the middle class, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that we only have a strong country when we have a strong and growing middle class.\xc2\xa0 So those will be some of the policies that will be included in that budget that will be rolled out in the weeks ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that the Obamas had dinner with the Clintons one week ago today.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 A lot of interesting dinners this week, I guess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, lots of interesting dinners.\xc2\xa0 Curious if you can confirm that?\xc2\xa0 I suppose you just did confirm that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And this dinner apparently happened one day before the President began his outreach, making these phone calls to Republicans last weekend.\xc2\xa0 Did former President Clinton mention that as his advice to the current President that perhaps some outreach might be a good thing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I can confirm the dinner for you.\xc2\xa0 It was a private dinner that the President and First Lady enjoyed with President Clinton and former Secretary of State Clinton.\xc2\xa0 They enjoyed the meal and they enjoyed the conversation, but I don\'t have any more details to read out to you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan outreach to rank-and-file members of Congress, that was actually something that started before that dinner.\xc2\xa0 The President had made some calls to members of the Gang of Eight a week prior to the dinner and had hosted Senator Graham and Senator McCain in the Oval Office the day before.\xc2\xa0 So this is an ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to President Clinton about what he thinks about that effort, but maybe you could --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He would certainly have some insights when it comes to government shutdowns and brinksmanship and dealing with the other side.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t say whether or not this came up at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He certainly does have that experience, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to read out the private dinner that they enjoyed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One thing that we heard from Jay and I guess from yourself here is there seems to be this reluctance to acknowledge that the President\xe2\x80\x99s I guess past strategy in terms of getting some kind of agreement from Republicans to go along with his proposals in bringing down the deficit.\xc2\xa0 The President used some campaign-style tactics -- holding events and so forth -- to get to that point, and that was not successful.\xc2\xa0 But Jay said, and has been saying all week, and the White House has been saying all week, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s only because there\xe2\x80\x99s no looming deadline that you tried this new approach.\xc2\xa0 I mean, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just sort of spin?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing more than that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about why the President spent so much time engaging the American public in the public debates that are happening in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 This was -- essentially, you could describe it as one of the core principles of his presidential campaign, that the President believed that we need to engage the American people in bringing change to Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And I know that this was the subject of some debate in the last election about the consequences of including the American public in that debate and whether or not change in Washington, D.C. was possible without including the American people in that debate.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President of the United States that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring change to Washington, if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to put in place the kinds of policies that are in the best interest of the country, that are in the best interest of our economy, that are in the best interest of the middle class -- all policies that the President supports -- that we need to engage the American public in that debate.\xc2\xa0 And the President will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve just tried and aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to try anymore.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that this is a sustained part of the job description, and as long as he\xe2\x80\x99s President, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be interested in engaging the American public in a robust debate about the direction that we should take our country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s also no coincidence that many of the policies that the President is advocating here in Washington, D.C. have the strong support of the American public.\xc2\xa0 Pursuing a balanced approach to deficit reduction is a classic example of this.\xc2\xa0 This is something that is strongly supported by the American public, and there are some polls that have indicated it\xe2\x80\x99s actually strongly supported by a majority of Republicans across the country.\xc2\xa0 The same dynamic exists when it comes to efforts to reduce gun violence in our communities.\xc2\xa0 There are many things that the President proposes, including closing loopholes in background checks, for example, and is strongly supported.\xc2\xa0 Some polls indicate that up to 90 percent of Americans actually support taking that kind of policy approach.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to include the American public in these debates.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s part of his job description to include them in these debates, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been -- he\xe2\x80\x99s long made the case that these debates will never be successful, or won\xe2\x80\x99t be successful without the strong support of the American public.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Kristen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment report came out today --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and showed that the economy is showing fresh signs of strength.\xc2\xa0 What does the President think the impact of the sequester will be on this latest economic picture that we got today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I suspect if the jobs numbers had been different it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have taken less than four people to ask me about them.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of our work, I think, here.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe did see the jobs numbers today.\xc2\xa0 The jobs numbers that came out today are the latest data point to indicate that our economy is gaining traction as we recover from the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 And there are a couple of different ways to look at these numbers.\xc2\xa0 Most importantly, over the course of the last 36 months, the American economy has created private sector jobs in each one of those months, for 36 consecutive months, for a total of almost 6.4 million private sector jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is a pretty good indication of the trajectory that we\xe2\x80\x99re on.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you just look at the last five months, the American economy has created 200,000 private sector jobs in four of those five months.\xc2\xa0 So we really are starting to gain some traction.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the question facing lawmakers in Washington, D.C. is:\xc2\xa0 Is Congress going to be engaged in an effort of putting in place the kinds of policies that will support that recovery, that will ensure that the economic recovery that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see, that\xe2\x80\x99s starting to gain traction, will benefit the middle class, and how will the policies in Washington help that along?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen policies put in place, or policies blocked by Congress -- Republicans in Congress -- that are actually plaguing our economy, not helping it.\xc2\xa0 And the manufactured obstacle that is the sequester is posing a challenge to our economy in much the same way that the fiscal cliff was; in much the same way that uncertainty around the payroll tax cut was; in much the same way, to a different degree, that the debt ceiling debate was.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that the sequester could weaken the economic outlook next month, could weaken the jobs report next month?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economic forecaster, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get in that business now.\xc2\xa0 Even weather forecasters have had a pretty tough week, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be an economic forecaster.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that Democrats and Republicans both agree that the sequester is going to have a negative impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 Democrats and Republicans agree that the sequester is going to have a negative impact on job creation.\xc2\xa0 And most economic analysts out there would tell you -- who have looked at this -- would tell you that the sequester itself actually does very little to reduce our deficit over the long term.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is such a strong advocate of a proposal of a balanced approach to our deficit reduction, where we can make some smart, strategic, targeted cuts in government spending, we can get some savings from entitlement programs, and we can close loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.\xc2\xa0 That kind of balanced approach would replace the sequester, would actually yield greater deficit reduction, and most importantly, would actually put in place a set of policies that are in the best interest of our economy and would strengthen the chances of success for middle-class families out there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, today is the last day of White House tours.\xc2\xa0 What is the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to all of the people who are going to be disappointed, frustrated, and upset this weekend that they are not going to be able to have a tour of the White House -- the people\xe2\x80\x99s house?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that the President and First Lady care strongly about.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard both the President and First Lady talk about the value of the White House as the people\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xc2\xa0 There are hundreds of thousands of people who come to the White House on a daily basis -- on a yearly basis, to tour the White House.\xc2\xa0 And the White House has a unique place as both the seat of government, the residence of the leader of the country, but also a museum.\xc2\xa0 And it is a shame that because of the sequester, those tours will no longer take place.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the people that the President is most concerned about, though, are the 750,000 Americans who stand to lose their job according to the CBO as a result of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 What we need is we need a long-term solution to dealing with our deficits that would turn off the sequester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a proposal that the President has put forward that has -- it\'s an approach that is strongly supported by the American public.\xc2\xa0 And you can see from the President\'s conversations and efforts over the last not just several days, but several weeks, that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed to finding a solution to this problem.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some of his critics have argued that he should cancel his golf outings and possibly even his vacation because there are these furloughs and potential layoffs that federal employees are facing.\xc2\xa0 What is his response to that?\xc2\xa0 And is that under consideration at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if -- I haven\'t heard anybody say that, so I\'m not sure who exactly is saying that.\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Gohmert.\xc2\xa0 People on Twitter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I assume he is one of the tea party Republicans who actually called the sequester a victory for the tea party.\xc2\xa0 The sequester is not a victory for the American people, I can tell you that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But what is his reaction to that type of criticism?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what the President has said is it\'s time for Democrats and Republicans to work together to solve this problem.\xc2\xa0 So I recognize that there may be some Republicans out there who think that this is great news, that think this is a victory and are cheering it on.\xc2\xa0 So the President is trying to find some Republicans who don\xe2\x80\x99t share that view who actually agree with the President that we need to find a way to reduce our deficits in a responsible way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned, the people who are cheering this as a big victory have left me a little mystified.\xc2\xa0 These are people who ostensibly campaigned because they wanted to reduce deficits.\xc2\xa0 The sequester actually does very little to reduce the deficit over the long term.\xc2\xa0 They campaigned on tax reform.\xc2\xa0 The sequester does nothing to reform the tax code.\xc2\xa0 They campaigned on reforming entitlements.\xc2\xa0 The sequester does nothing to reform the entitlement system or get savings from the entitlement system.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s not actually clear to me what they\'re cheering.\xc2\xa0 And truly, they\'re not cheering the 750,000 Americans who would lose their jobs, according to the Congressional Budget Office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have a difference of opinion with the Republicans who espouse the point of view that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But the President is looking for Republicans and Democrats who are going to work with him to solve this problem.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you know, there\'s a movement put by some of the President\'s critics to collect private donations to keep the White House tours from being canceled because of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Is that technically possible?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if it\'s technically possible.\xc2\xa0 My guess is that it\'s not.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is the sequester mandates across-the-board, non-strategic, indiscriminate cuts to the budget.\xc2\xa0 It allows very little, if any, flexibility for those who are administering the budget.\xc2\xa0 And it means agency heads are put in a very difficult position of choosing between two bad options.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan talked about this a little bit.\xc2\xa0 He said that a significant portion of his budget was dedicated to providing educational opportunities for disabled children, and another significant portion of the budget was dedicated to providing economic -- or education opportunities for poor children.\xc2\xa0 And as he posed the question, are you asking me to cut programs for disabled children so that we can protect programs for poor children or the other way around?\xc2\xa0 These are bad choices and bad options.\xc2\xa0 This is bad policy.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the reason it was -- that Democrats and Republicans put it in place to try to force a smart option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\'s disappointing that there are some who are cheering this as a big political victory, because the American people certainly don\'t see it as a victory for them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On today\'s jobs numbers, does that indicate that the sequester -- the fear of it -- is having less of an impact than you all expected, or is the bad news still to come?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to just take my word for it.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of economic analysts who looked at the fourth quarter GDP numbers who concluded that the looming sequester did have an impact on economic growth, a pretty significant one.\xc2\xa0 The CBO has calculated that there are up to three-quarters of a million Americans who could lose their job as a result of the sequester, that it could have an impact as large as taking six-tenths of a percentage point off of GDP.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there are clear consequences, bad consequences for the sequester, and that\'s why the President is dedicated to trying to solve that problem.\xc2\xa0 Washington for too long has careened from one financial and fiscal crisis to another in a way that has impeded economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The data points are in place to indicate that we have a remarkably resilient economy.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re starting to gain traction, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for politicians in Washington to work across the aisle to put in place policies that will support -- not inhibit -- that recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why should we not conclude -- since the White House tours came up and they end tomorrow, why should we not conclude that the choice of ending the tours by the White House was made to inflict maximum pain on Congress and be very publicly noticeable since you could have trimmed the Secret Service budget in other ways?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the Secret Service would acknowledge that.\xc2\xa0 I think that they --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their choice to close the tours.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they presented options to you.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\'s what they would say if you asked them.\xc2\xa0 So you can ask them that.\xc2\xa0 But there are very strict limits to how much flexibility is included here.\xc2\xa0 We are presented with a range of bad options, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine me standing up here being questioned by you, being asked the same question about why we didn\'t choose some other bad option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, look, the point here is that the cancellation of White House tours is something we\xe2\x80\x99re not very happy about.\xc2\xa0 But what we\xe2\x80\x99re also not very happy about is the potential economic impact of the sequester, including people who stand to lose their jobs as a result of it.\xc2\xa0 So this is a problem that we have to get solved regardless of -- even if it didn\'t impact White House tours, this is something that the President would be very focused on and interested in solving.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While I would never dream of suggesting that politics plays any role in this, it does seem to me that there were other choices.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service has to make trims.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It did.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you chose to make those trims by saying there\xe2\x80\x99s no tours so that you don\'t have to have overtime for the Secret Service people who are involved in the tours.\xc2\xa0 There must be other ways.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a couple of options, but as I pointed out, there\xe2\x80\x99s no magic wand here that we can wave to comply with the sequester.\xc2\xa0 The reason that the sequester was put in place, just to remind you, was to put in place a policy that was so onerous and terrible that it would actually force Democrats and Republicans to come together to find an alternative solution.\xc2\xa0 They didn\'t do that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting here telling me it seems ridiculous that this terrible policy is in place and it\xe2\x80\x99s having an impact on White House tours, I would agree with you.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s the way that it was designed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was talking about your choice of White House tours as the avenue to implement the policy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, if you want to talk to the Secret Service about the range of options that they considered, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99d be -- my guess is they\'re going to tell you the same thing I am, which is that there are no good options here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their choice.\xc2\xa0 It was the White House\xe2\x80\x99s.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it actually -- they did present a range of choices.\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking about the range of choices that we had, and I think they would be -- I think they will tell you that that range of choices went from bad to worse.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Abu Ghaith -- not only is this bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law, he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who has spent theoretically more than a decade in Iran with other al Qaeda figures.\xc2\xa0 What was the top priority here?\xc2\xa0 Bringing him to justice or getting intelligence out of him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the benefit of the system that I\xe2\x80\x99ve described to you is that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to do both -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to question him as a part of the regular process of detaining individuals like this, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also able to put him through Article 3 courts to ensure that he\xe2\x80\x99s held accountable for his crimes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The crimes that he\xe2\x80\x99s committed are terrible.\xc2\xa0 From at least May 2001 up to and around 2002, Abu Ghaith served alongside Osama bin Laden, appearing with bin Laden and his then deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, speaking on behalf of the terrorist organization in support of its mission and warning that attacks similar to 9/11 would continue.\xc2\xa0 So this is somebody who is going to be held accountable for his crimes and will be done -- and that will be done in accordance with the laws and values of this country, and it will be done so in a pretty efficient way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, I guess my proposal to you, unlike in Bill\xe2\x80\x99s choice, we don\'t have to choose.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re able to do both, and that\'s exactly what we did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he read his Miranda rights?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You have to talk to the Department of Justice about the specifics of his handling.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of questioning, what kind of -- are we getting any useful intelligence out of him?\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xc2\xa0 -- what was the process here?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems like he was very quickly moved to this criminal process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Your interest in this is certainly understandable, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to read out specific intelligence that may or may not have been gleaned from him.\xc2\xa0 And if you have questions about how that questioning process worked, then I would encourage you to talk to the Department of Justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you were asked about Bloomberg.\xc2\xa0 Was Congress informed of this decision to bring him to the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that we are in regular communication with members of Congress, but in terms of this specific piece of news, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you some more information about what the communications were like between the administration and Congress on this.*<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Roger.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the economy for a moment.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Krueger said this morning that the sequester is going to be plaguing the economy, and you repeated that here again today.\xc2\xa0 How do you explain the records on Wall Street this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in a position of trying to analyze the markets.\xc2\xa0 There are people who are paid lots of money every year --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But clearly, the market is ignoring it.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to interpret the markets from up here.\xc2\xa0 There are people who are paid millions of dollars, and probably lose millions of dollars, trying to interpret the vagaries of the stock market.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do it for free.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, back on the economy and the jobs numbers.\xc2\xa0 It went from 7.9 to 7.7 percent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good, I guess.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s actually the lowest figure since December 2008, before this President took office.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But is this White House bracing for the worst as it relates to sequestration?\xc2\xa0 I talked to the acting Labor Secretary and he said sequestration will definitely put the brakes on job growth in this country.\xc2\xa0 Are you bracing for the worst with reports down the road in the next couple of months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We are certainly concerned -- I think you could even say very concerned -- about the habit in Washington, D.C., particularly Republicans in Congress, who repeatedly are throwing up obstacles to a recovery that\xe2\x80\x99s starting to gain traction.\xc2\xa0 So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the debt limit fight of August of 2011 or the fiscal cliff of earlier this year -- we had the payroll tax fight a couple of times -- and even the sequester are all policies that are supported by Republicans that do not have a positive impact on our economy.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no two ways around it.\xc2\xa0 Every economist will tell you that.\xc2\xa0 And even Republicans talk about the terrible toll that uncertainty has on our economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President is ready to sit down with Republicans who share his concern to do something serious about our deficit, but to do it in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to be constructive for the economy, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to expand the economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Those are the President\'s core goals, and those are goals that we can accomplish through the process of turning off the sequester.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s time to get that done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Touching on something you just said -- the President is ready to sit down and talk with Republicans -- I talked to Marcia Fudge, head of the Congressional Black Caucus, and she said Democrats as a whole want to be on the front end to know what the President is talking about.\xc2\xa0 She is saying the President can come to the Hill, but they just don\'t know what he is doing or what he is offering to Republicans.\xc2\xa0 What say you about that?\xc2\xa0 Democrats want to know what the President is offering to Republicans, and they\'re not involved in the negotiations.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is certainly interested in talking to rank-and-file members in both parties.\xc2\xa0 So the President had lunch with Congressman Van Hollen yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He was included in the lunch that the President had with Congressman Ryan.\xc2\xa0 The three of them dined together.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Next week -- and I\'ll get to the week ahead here in a little bit -- but next week, the President will be traveling up to Capitol Hill, where he will be speaking at both the Senate Democratic Caucus meeting and the House Democratic Caucus meeting.\xc2\xa0 And those will be opportunities for the President to talk to those Democrats about his legislative priorities.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, that includes some of these budget issues that we\'ve spent a lot of time talking about today.\xc2\xa0 But it also includes some of the things that I talked about at the beginning of this briefing about how the President wants to pursue comprehensive immigration reform, about how the President believes that we can pursue policies that would reduce gun violence in communities all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President put forward some specific proposals in the State of the Union that would strengthen the middle class -- proposals like increasing the minimum wage and indexing it to inflation; proposals like expanding access to early childhood education programs that are so critical to the success of children in this country.\xc2\xa0 So there are a number of things at the top the President\'s legislative agenda, and he looks forward to talking to Democrats about them next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 The White House hasn\'t ruled out the possibility that the President might cancel his trip to Israel, because the Israeli government is not formed.\xc2\xa0 I just wondered if that\'s something --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me do that for you now.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re going?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so you\'re ruling out the possibility of canceling the trip.\xc2\xa0 Okay, thank you.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President think he has an opportunity to influence the way the government is put together, perhaps with more centrist elements in it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The formation of the Israeli government is the responsibility of Prime Minister Netanyahu and others who have -- other senior officials in the Israeli government who will be responsible for that task.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s not something that the President would interfere with.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is primarily going on this trip to accomplish a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One is he is very interested in talking to the Israeli public while he is there -- that there is an opportunity for him to demonstrate his support for Israel and his commitment to their security, something that we spent a lot of time talking about last year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re also operating at a time when the region -- Israel\'s neighborhood, if you will -- is undergoing a pretty severe transition.\xc2\xa0 There\'s crisis and it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the people of Israel to understand that the American people stand with them in the time of crisis, and that we\'re going to be there to protect them and to work with them to ensure their security.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might he be trying to persuade the Israeli public on any particular point -- about peace talks maybe, for example?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is traveling -- I guess we should point out the President is traveling to Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan.\xc2\xa0 And while the President is not going with any specific peace plan in hand, the President\'s views about the interest that the Israeli people have in pursuing a peace process that he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interest of both parties, both Palestinians and the Israelis, to pursue a peace agreement.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that he will certainly be talking about with the leaders of the newly formed government when it\'s formed.\xc2\xa0 It\'s something that he will be talking about with President Abbas.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is an opportunity for him to have that discussion and make sure that it remains clear to them that Middle East peace, that peace between the Israelis and Palestinians remains a priority of the President, that that\'s something that he is -- that the United States is ready to strongly support if that dialogue is ready to take off.\xc2\xa0 And that will be the subject of a lot of conversation while we\'re there, but it won\'t be because the President is presenting a specific plan.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a question about that also?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\'s concern among Israelis that they\'re going to take a defense hit, a defense funding hit from the U.S. because of sequester -- the $155 million is going to be erased from their allocation.\xc2\xa0 What\'s the administration saying about that?\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort to close that gap?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, the sequester grants very little flexibility in terms of shifting money between these categories.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases, that lack of flexibility requires difficult and painful decisions.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what impact this would have on military aid to Israel, so I would encourage you to check with the Department of Defense who would have some more knowledge of this at a granular level.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d check with them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 What is the way forward on the sequester at this point?\xc2\xa0 What is the most practical way to turn it off?\xc2\xa0 Would that happen in the context of the grand bargain?\xc2\xa0 Or is there a discrete piece of legislation that the President is interested in negotiating to turn off the sequester as soon as possible?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think the answer to that is really clear right now.\xc2\xa0 I think that is the subject of a lot of these discussions that the President has been having the last couple of days, and I think it will be the subject of discussions that the President has moving forward.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference to -- again, I think this is another case where we actually don\'t have to choose, that the fault lines here of an agreement are pretty clear where our common ground lies.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is bipartisan agreement that we can make some smart cuts to government spending.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan agreement that we can get some savings from entitlement programs.\xc2\xa0 And there at least used to be bipartisan agreement -- two months ago there was bipartisan agreement -- that there was plenty of revenue that could be gained by closing tax loopholes that only benefit the wealthy and the well-connected.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the outlines of a deal here are pretty quick.\xc2\xa0 So ostensibly, you could imagine a scenario where we could act quickly to consummate a deal like that that would actually reduce our deficit significantly over the long term and turn off the sequester.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that can\'t happen pretty quick.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, as a follow-up, do you anticipate this outreach we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from the President -- going to the Hill next week -- this will continue?\xc2\xa0 Will there be more lunches?\xc2\xa0 More dinners?\xc2\xa0 More trips to the Hill in the coming weeks and months?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything additional on the schedule to inform you about, but the President certainly remains committed to preserving an open line of communication with rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans who are interested in working with him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re also not na\xc3\xafve about this process.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to continue to talk to the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader in the House.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to talk to the Democratic leader and Republican leaders in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But this is -- I think you could view this as an opportunity for the President to engage in a new line of communication and an open and constructive dialogue that could contribute to a solution.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Olivier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a couple for you.\xc2\xa0 First, does the President want to see the authorization for the use of military force to be updated and expanded to keep up with his updated and expanded war on terrorism?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Olivier, I think the way that I\xe2\x80\x99d answer your question is to say this:\xc2\xa0 The authorization to use military force is something that grants the necessary legal authorities for the President to pursue elements of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done very aggressively.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone after the core elements and actually decimated the core elements of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and in that region.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been pretty aggressive in our pursuit of elements of al Qaeda that are tied to AQAP -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; and AQIM -- al Qaeda in the Maghreb.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that we are dedicated to.\xc2\xa0 It is something that is critical to ensuring the national security of our country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s something that is ongoing, and that is something that -- that is an authority that is granted to the President under the current authorization to use military force.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as you expand to groups that are, as one official said, \xe2\x80\x9cassociates of associates\xe2\x80\x9d of al Qaeda, you don\'t feel that you need to update this piece of legislation at all?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, we feel like we have the authorities we need to go after elements of al Qaeda and those self-identified enemies of the United States and our allies and our interests, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing that very aggressively in order to protect the American people and our interests.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Abu Ghaith, what role did the government of Iran play, if any, in the sequence of events that led ultimately to his capture?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 For details about the sequence of events, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I just don\'t have anything on that for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just told April about what the President wants to talk to the Democratic caucuses next week.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what he wants to talk to the Republicans about?\xc2\xa0 And will he nuance his message between the House and the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I unnecessarily limited the scope of my answer to April\xe2\x80\x99s narrowly tailored question.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not a critique of your question.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more a critique of my answer, to be honest with you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that makes you feel better or not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it makes me feel better.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Suffice it to say the President is interested in talking about the range of his priorities to both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 That includes, first and foremost, strengthening our economy and putting in place policies that will expand economic opportunity for the middle class in this country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s focal point.\xc2\xa0 That\'s his North Star, as he described in the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to spend some time talking about that to both Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a lot of members of both caucuses, Democrats and Republicans, who share that policy priority.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will also talk to them about some of the other things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about today:\xc2\xa0 a balanced approach to deficit reduction; finally reforming our broken immigration system; reducing gun violence in communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0 So there are -- I would also anticipate, actually, that the President will talk about his upcoming trip to Israel.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are a number of members of Congress, again, in both parties, that are very interested in the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a pretty long list when he goes up there to visit with them, and I think it will be a constructive opportunity for dialogue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any nuance between the House and the Senate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then just very quickly, anything you can tell us about Labor?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re hearing that you might be close to announcing something there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t walk out with any personnel announcements today, so I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer you any guidance on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Victoria.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken to the President of South Korea about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s threats?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific calls to read out to you, but I can read you something about North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s threats, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to?\xc2\xa0 Could you also let us know that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any trips to tell you about right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, is he going to talk with her?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, is he going to make any phone calls?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If he does, I would anticipate that would be the kind of thing we might read out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or not.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Or not.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOnto a more serious subject:\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s threats are not helpful.\xc2\xa0 We have consistently called on North Korea to improve relations with its neighbors, including South Korea.\xc2\xa0 This is a moment for the North to seize the opportunity presented by a new government in Seoul, not to threaten it.\xc2\xa0 Further provocative actions would only increase Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s isolation, and its continued focus on its nuclear and missile program is doing nothing to help the North Korean people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDan.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the meeting with Jewish leaders last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to ask you to confirm quotes coming out of that, but one of them in the Post said -- quoted the President as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to beat my chest\xe2\x80\x9d to prove his toughness on the issue of the Iran nuclear -- on the Iran nuclear issue.\xc2\xa0 It seemed to indicate to some that there was a quite sharp questioning of him about his commitment.\xc2\xa0 Is he frustrated at this point that maybe some people haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten that message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has been pretty clear about this.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons that we have such a strong relationship with Israel, is because we have demonstrated our unity with them.\xc2\xa0 We stand shoulder to shoulder with them as we demonstrate to the Iranians that it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to live up to their international obligations, to their obligations to the United Nations, to their obligations to the IAEA.\xc2\xa0 And it remains a pretty bright red line for the President that Iran should not attain a nuclear weapon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about this, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s really any misunderstanding about that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the red line as bright as it is for Netanyahu?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m having trouble deciphering the different shades of brightness there.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, Cheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Just any update on what date the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget will be out?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on that, but weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet me read to you the --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, we never heard back as to what cuts the White House is making here in its own personnel, in its own budget here as it relates to sequestration.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a couple of times this week that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get those details; we haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten those details.\xc2\xa0 When are we going to hear anything besides the White House tours being --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that there are a number of ways that the White House also has to deal with the consequences of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 The White House and the components of the White House are affected by the sequester in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s similar to other government agencies.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we\xe2\x80\x99re making significant -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re also faced with making some tough decisions when it comes to ongoing projects, when it comes to purchasing equipment and supplies.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re also a pretty personnel-heavy agency, if you will.\xc2\xa0 So that means that there will be agencies -- that there will be employees of components who work here at the White House that will be facing pay cuts, that will be facing furloughs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, this is the result of a policy that Democrats and Republicans agree is really bad.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad way to run a government.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that much to reduce the deficit over the long term.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a good alternative.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But those will be made public?\xc2\xa0 Those details will be made public?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that the Office of Management and Budget has put forward a variety of charts that indicate the impact of the budget -- of the sequester on the budget, including the budget of the White House.\xc2\xa0 And what I have described to you is the practical impact of that to help you get a sense of what behind the numbers is the tangible impact here.\xc2\xa0 And that means that there will be some projects that are suspended.\xc2\xa0 It means that there will be some supply purchases that are put off.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an impact on the personnel here at the White House -- pay cuts, furloughs and other things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the West Wing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the West Wing as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In the West Wing as well.\xc2\xa0 Everybody who works at the White House.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOkay.\xc2\xa0 On that happy note, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to read the week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that where Jay is today?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s hard at work today.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Saturday, the President will deliver remarks at the Gridiron dinner, at the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 I suspect many of you will be there to see him.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis is an interesting one:\xc2\xa0 The President, on Tuesday, will welcome His Majesty the Sultan of Brunei to the White House.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Brunei have strong bilateral relations and have a shared interest in working together to ensure the continued peace, stability, and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to discussing preparations for the East Asia Summit and the U.S.-ASEAN Summit, which will be held in Brunei in October.\xc2\xa0 The President will also consult with His Majesty on a broad range of strategic and economic issues of mutual concern.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLater on Tuesday, the President will travel to Capitol Hill to meet with the Senate Democratic Caucus.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Wednesday, the President will travel back to Capitol Hill to meet with the House Republican Conference.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, on Thursday, the President will travel to Capitol Hill to meet separately with the Senate Republican Conference and then back over to meet with the House Democratic Caucus.\xc2\xa0 The timing of all those meetings I believe is still up in the air, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on that exact timing when those meetings are closer.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd then, as I mentioned, on Friday, the President will travel to Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois, for an event focused on American energy.\xc2\xa0 More details on that trip will be released early next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd with that, I hope you all have a great weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.
