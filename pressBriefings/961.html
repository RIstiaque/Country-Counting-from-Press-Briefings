Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t1:16 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs you know, later this afternoon, the President and the Prime Minister of Great Britain will be traveling to Dayton, Ohio, where the President looks forward to hosting the Prime Minister at an NCAA Tournament play-in game.\xc2\xa0 As you probably know if you\'re a college basketball fan, Dayton has been a very enthusiastic host to the play-in games for a number of years now. We appreciate their hospitality.\xc2\xa0 Dayton is the home of the Wright Brothers, the Dayton Peace Accords, and Guided By Voices\xc2\xa0 -- the greatest rock and roll band of the modern era.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 In my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the NCAA frown upon play-in?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not a sports guy -- at least in this job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions on Afghanistan, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President, in the Rose Garden today, in talking about the killing of the Afghan civilians and the need for an investigation, said, "We will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable."\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify, is there some reason to think that there was more than one person involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I think you probably know, there was a briefing at the Defense Department where this was discussed, and I would refer you to my colleagues over at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 There is an investigation ongoing.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is there\'s no reason to believe that there was more than one shooter, but that they are talking to a number of individuals as part of that investigation.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor more details, though, you should go to the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, I wanted to go back to the issue of troop withdrawals.\xc2\xa0 The President said twice today in his comments that he wants to bring the end to the war responsibly.\xc2\xa0 He talked yesterday in some interviews about not having a rush to the exit.\xc2\xa0 And last week from the podium he said when asked about his that he wants a gradual withdrawal, not a clip.\xc2\xa0 So all of those signals point to this gradual, methodical withdrawal.\xc2\xa0 Is there any serious consideration, given the incidents the last couple weeks, to something different than that, a faster withdrawal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\'s be clear, Ben.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s policy is to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan as we transfer security responsible to Afghan forces.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the strategy he put into place, and that\'s the strategy he has been implementing. We are in the middle of the drawdown of the surge forces.\xc2\xa0 As you know, by the end of this summer, those 33,000 troops will be home.\xc2\xa0 And he has said that we will continue to remove U.S. forces through -- beyond the drawdown of the surge forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe pace of that withdrawal has not been decided.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s important to understand that in spite of recent events, the strategy is a broad-based strategy that looks at the achievement of our objectives and the fact that this President is committed to ending the war in Afghanistan responsibly, in a way that ensures that we have successfully taken the fight to\xc2\xa0 al Qaeda, which is the number-one, primary objective of the strategy, and that we have stabilized Afghanistan so that Afghan security forces can be responsible for the security of their nation, and that we can ensure that Afghanistan will not be host to al Qaeda in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to quickly follow, you said that the pace has not been decided, and I realize nothing has been announced or formalized, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s language has consistently suggested a gradual, steady withdrawal after September of the remaining 68,000 troops.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that is still the position of the President, or if there is, in fact, consideration of something that would be faster than that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear for some time now that the pace of the withdrawal of the remaining 68,000 -- after the surge forces are withdrawn will be decided in consultation with NATO ministers and will have everything to do with the successful implementation of the strategy.\xc2\xa0 And that remains the case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut contrary to reports that appeared today, there are no options being reviewed with specific troop numbers attached to them; there are no individuals promoting specific options over others.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just simply false.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to drawing down forces, removing American troops from Afghanistan as we transfer security authority to the Afghan forces, and doing that in a way that allows us to achieve our objectives.\xc2\xa0 And that has not changed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any more information about this accused soldier and the brain trauma that he may have had?\xc2\xa0 Was he redeployed too quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information with regards to any individual who may or may not be involved in this incident.\xc2\xa0 As you might guess, I would not comment on the specifics of an investigation that\xe2\x80\x99s just now gotten underway.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the -- are you concerned at all about the issue of being deployed -- or redeployed too early in the light of an incident like this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment on that in relation to any specific incident like this that\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- even that answer I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have read as even an acknowledgement of the specifics that you stated regarding one individual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe general issue of the duration of the war in Afghanistan, the duration of the two wars, Iraq having just been ended by this President, is one that this President talked about when he was running for office and one that the entire national security apparatus is very sensitive to.\xc2\xa0 The remarkable sacrifice and commitment of America\xe2\x80\x99s men and women in uniform is something that this President comments on all the time, both publicly and privately.\xc2\xa0 And the toll that that takes on the individuals, as well as on their families is substantial.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s very aware of that.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he has made sure that the care that veterans receive is as top-notch as it can be, and he is committed to providing the resources necessary to ensure that, and why he is so committed to ensuring that our returning veterans get extra help as they enter the job market in an economy that is still just recovering from a terrible recession.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on one other topic, the announcement this morning about the WTO ruling -- or the WTO case, rather.\xc2\xa0 What was the reasoning behind the timing of that?\xc2\xa0 Why was it announced today instead of maybe a couple months ago?\xc2\xa0 And was the context of the election and the Republican race and the criticism from Republican candidates about Obama\xe2\x80\x99s China policy at all a driver for that timing?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it was announced today because today the time was appropriate to announce this new trade case.\xc2\xa0 And this trade case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken up at the World Trade Organization against China on the issue of rare earth materials is consistent with the approach this President has taken since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I think you heard a number of officials say in the past, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat, we have taken cases against China to the WTO at a pace nearly double that of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 That begins going back to the early months of 2009, when we took the case on Chinese tires and won it.\xc2\xa0 And the result has been that a thousand Americans have had help in ensuring that they kept their jobs because of that action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ensuring that America\xe2\x80\x99s workers and businesses compete on a level playing field with competitors around the globe, and in this case China, is extremely firm and has been since he took office.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s evidenced by the series of actions that we\'ve taken with regards to China specifically, but also with regards to other countries when it comes to trade fairness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is of a piece of that commitment, as is the announcement the President made in the State of the Union address, the establishment of a Trade Enforcement Unit.\xc2\xa0 That\'s also part of this ongoing effort to make sure that the Chinese understand, again, when it would -- it\'s not aimed solely at China at all, but when there are issues with China, that the Chinese understand that they need to compete on a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 And if they do then we have no problem with that.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly feel that given that opportunity, that we will -- our workers, our businesses will be highly competitive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when you\'re taking about rare earth, I mean, these are important materials because they\'re the materials that are essential to technologies like cellular phones and hybrid vehicles and advanced batteries.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are markets and technologies and industries that the United States of America needs to dominate in the 21st century if we are going to succeed and have an economy built to last.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you feel you have to emphasize the President\'s record because of Republican criticism about it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, because that would -- I guess you could say that we\'ve been doing that for three years because of anticipating criticism about it.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we\'ve been at this for three years because it\'s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And we made that clear on the President\'s trip to Asia not long ago, late last year.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s made it clear, and this administration has made it clear from the very beginning, from early 2009, again, citing that very early case at the WTO against China.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s an ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 And this is just part of that consistent effort to make sure that our businesses, our workers have a fair shot at competing globally.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wonder if you could respond to comments made yesterday by the Senate\'s number-two Republican, Jon Kyl.\xc2\xa0 He said, in terms of the Afghanistan strategy laid out by the President, the President has been AWOL, and he\'s been apologetic. And I\'m wondering if you can sort of offer any comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see those comments.\xc2\xa0 I think everyone who has been covering Afghanistan understands clearly that when this President took office, he inherited a war in Afghanistan that had been adrift, that had lacked a focus.\xc2\xa0 I remember the Vice President saying that when he went out during the transition to Afghanistan on behalf of the President-elect, that he came back and was able to report that if you asked 10 of our people on the ground in Afghanistan what the mission was you would get 10 different answers.\xc2\xa0 The President was committed to change that, and committed to focusing again our efforts in Afghanistan on our primary objective, which, after all, was al Qaeda, and that had been lost.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any doubt -- and I\xe2\x80\x99d be amazed if Senator Kyl could express a doubt -- that this President has taken the fight very directly and effectively to al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 And that is absolutely a result of his very focused, very clear-eyed strategy in Afghanistan and in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a challenging mission in a very challenging part of the world, and there have been setbacks along the way, even as we have executed this very clear-eyed policy.\xc2\xa0 But this President made clear when he was running for office what he would do with regards to Afghanistan, and he has delivered very much on what he said he would do.\xc2\xa0 And he is delivering now, as he withdraws U.S. forces from Afghanistan, in keeping with the strategy he outlined.</p>\n<p>\n\tBill.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore you start, did anybody -- I just want to make -- if anybody has not yet seen Bill Plante\xe2\x80\x99s piece on Selma, Alabama, they ought to check it out.\xc2\xa0 Bill, you may not know, covered the original events in Selma and was back there last weekend, and it was really worth watching.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d check it out.</p>\n<p>\n\tSorry to embarrass you.\xc2\xa0 Go, Bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you for that.\xc2\xa0 The President seems to be going out of his way to pay more attention to Prime Minister Cameron than to most foreign leaders.\xc2\xa0 Is this because he\xe2\x80\x99s perceived in some quarters to have sort of shrugged off the so-called "special relationship"?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think the fact that we are hosting the Prime Minister in the manner that we are demonstrates the nature of the relationship between our two countries, the fact that it is a special relationship.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was evident by the manner in which President Obama was hosted in London last year.\xc2\xa0 And this is a great opportunity, as the President sees it, to reciprocate for that remarkable hospitality and he looks forward to this visit very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd setting aside those formalities and the social nature of it -- the dinners and things -- this is an extraordinarily important relationship.\xc2\xa0 I think we are speaking about China, and our relationship with China and our trade relationship with China is extremely important.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that the United Kingdom invest 140 times the amount of China in the United States.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think most people know that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the U.K. is a key ally across the globe -- in Afghanistan, in our efforts in Libya, in Syria -- around the globe -- in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 So I think the nature and the trappings of the visit are very appropriate given the kind of relationship we have with Great Britain.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, not everybody gets to watch basketball with the President.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s reflective of the kind of relationship that we have with the United Kingdom, and that previous Presidents have had with previous Prime Ministers.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of the relationship between the two countries that I think is reflected by the itinerary that\'s been developed for this trip.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise to anyone that this administration wants to continue to build on that very longstanding, very special relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve forgiven them for burning the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Almost.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if Bill had anything to do with the CBS News poll that also had interesting data, but it says that 54 percent of Americans believe gas prices are something a President can do a lot about.\xc2\xa0 And since the President has said repeatedly that there\xe2\x80\x99s no silver bullet, is there a disconnect here where a majority of the public is saying, yes, there is something you can do?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, putting aside individual polls and what they say, we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on the implementation of policies that will enhance our energy security, reduce our reliance on foreign oil imports, diversify resources of energy that we have that we depend on in this country, and by doing so, grow the industries that create good jobs in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no question that there\xe2\x80\x99s frustration out there in the country because of the high price of gasoline.\xc2\xa0 And we have seen that occur over the years almost on a regular basis, either every couple of years or every year.\xc2\xa0 It happened last year.\xc2\xa0 It happened in 2008.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure in the time that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering Washington, it\xe2\x80\x99s happened more than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat is a simple fact -- and I have engaged in this discussion from here with you and with others off camera -- is that regardless of how we got there -- and we got there in part because of the actions of this administration -- but regardless of what folks may say about what got us there, we are producing\xc2\xa0 -- we have dramatically increased our production of oil and gas in this country in the last three years since President Obama took office.\xc2\xa0 That is a fact.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also a fact, contrary to the latest pushback from critics, that we have increased our production on public lands and waters over the last three years by 13 percent.\xc2\xa0 And this is all to the good.\xc2\xa0 This is all in keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, an all-of-the-above strategy, as we try to diversify our energy sources and become more energy independent.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also points to the fact that simply by increasing the production of oil and gas in this country, you will not then necessarily lower prices at the pump, because prices at the pump are dependent on a whole series of factors and are directly correlated to the global price of oil.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re producing more, we\xe2\x80\x99re importing less, and the price of gas goes up.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s because of growth in China, India and Brazil and other places.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s because of unrest in the Middle East, and it\xe2\x80\x99s because of a number of factors -- only a handful of which we can control.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo in that situation, the President then focuses on a strategy that will continue to reduce our imports, continue to diversify our sources of energy, and create a situation where in the future we will not be as subject to the wild fluctuations in the oil markets as we are today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is also very focused on what Americans are having to endure right now when they fill up their gas tanks.\xc2\xa0 He has made sure, as I think I talked about yesterday, that his Justice Department has reconstituted the group that\'s looking into -- the unit that looks into potential fraud and speculation.\xc2\xa0 He wants to ensure that we\'re making sure that that kind of activity is not taking place, and that consumers aren\'t getting gouged.\xc2\xa0 And he is looking at a variety of ways that we can reduce the price of -- if possible, reduce the price of gas, or relieve the pressure that is driving the price of gas up in this country, and that includes relieving bottlenecks and issues like that around the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it is a fallacy, as I said yesterday, to suggest that there is some 3-point plan or 5-point plan out there that could magically, if you wave a wand, reduce the price that Americans are paying for a gallon of gas.\xc2\xa0 I said yesterday that anybody who said that would be a liar, and I shouldn\'t have gone at motivations; I should have said that anybody who says that doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing -- there\'s also -- obviously there\'s negative polls, there are some positive ones as well.\xc2\xa0 The National Journal has one saying that more Americans believe the President\'s policies will lower gas prices than they believe Republican policies will.\xc2\xa0 AAA has a survey:\xc2\xa0 84 percent of respondents said they\'ve changed their habits.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s obviously impacted them.\xc2\xa0 That\'s tough, but some of them -- 16 percent -- for example, said that they\'ve now bought or leased a more energy-efficient vehicle.\xc2\xa0 They\'re changing their habits.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see that as a positive sign that some of the things he\'s called for with renewables and whatnot are working?\xc2\xa0 How do the American people\'s behavior, how does that fit into the all-of-the-above strategy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people -- and I know the President believes this -- are focused on their lives and on getting by, and putting gas in the gas tank, getting their kids to school, paying the mortgage or the rent.\xc2\xa0 How people in the future approach the decisions about buying cars remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 But what is absolutely the case is that, because of the historic fuel-efficiency standards that this President put into place through executive action, working with all the major automobile companies, Americans who buy cars in the future will be buying cars that are much more fuel-efficient.\xc2\xa0 By 2025, that fuel-efficiency average will be something like 54.5 miles per gallon.\xc2\xa0 That means an enormous amount of savings -- $1.7 trillion saved in costs for the American consumer.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s important.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd it is also important that -- I mean, it is simply a fact, Ed, and everybody knows it, that in the future we and other countries will be, by necessity, relying on a diverse array of energy sources:\xc2\xa0 fossil fuels, solar, nuclear, biofuels, wind, advanced batteries.\xc2\xa0 And we need to be in the thick of the competition in all of those industries, not just fossil fuel production, but all of them.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 And that approach will result in jobs in this country and will result in more energy independence in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tKristen, and then Jake.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Human Rights Watch is reporting that Syria has been laying landmines near its borders with Lebanon and Turkey.\xc2\xa0 What is your reaction to that, and does your intelligence match those reports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t discuss intelligence.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised by, and no one in this administration would be surprised by dangerous, militaristic behavior by the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 After all, they have been waging war on their own people for many, many months now.\xc2\xa0 And the toll of that war continues to increase.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s writing -- the Syrian regime is writing its own horrific page in history and the history of its country and the history of the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we continue to work with our international partners and allies through the "Friends of Syria" to pressure Assad, isolate Assad, to make clear to the world that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s actions are intolerable and that Syrians deserve a better future.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners to try to get humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people and to try to bring about a resolution that results in Assad no longer being in power and the Syrian people being able to decide the fate of their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a tipping point in Syria that would cause the conversations to shift from humanitarian aid and sanctions to more intervention, more aggressive intervention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is certainly our position that providing arms -- which is one topic that I get asked about and others have discussed -- is not a move that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering right now because we believe it could heighten and prolong the violence in Syria.\xc2\xa0 We are also still learning about the composition of the armed opposition in Syria and that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the process that we\xe2\x80\x99re undergoing right now as we engage with our allies on the matter, on the Syrian issue.\xc2\xa0 So it is our position that we do not want to contribute to the further militarization of Syria because that could lead down a very dangerous road.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just looking forward a little bit, Jay, the President is visiting South Korea at the end of the month.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little about his decision to visit the DMZ, obviously something that past Presidents have done?\xc2\xa0 And also, what will his message be to South Korea given the recent developments with North Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say simply that we coordinate very closely with our South Korean allies with regards to North Korea, and on a whole host of other issues.\xc2\xa0 I think, speaking of state visits, when the South Korean leader was here, I think it made clear to the world how vital we consider that relationship, that partnership, that alliance with the South Koreans.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged with the South Koreans on a whole host of issues, including on economic issues and defense issues.\xc2\xa0 And all of this -- the summit in Seoul is obviously about nuclear security, but our relationship with South Korea is vital and stronger than it has ever been.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the DMZ part?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what we have announced, but it certainly is -- a visit to the DMZ would be reflective of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to both security on the Korean Peninsula and the need for North Korea to live up to its international obligations, give up its nuclear weapons program, and return to the community of nations.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that he\xe2\x80\x99s making that visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just speaking hypothetically.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not confirming that at all.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If we could just parse the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement about Africa -- I mean, Afghanistan just a little bit more.\xc2\xa0 The President used the term \xe2\x80\x9cmurder,\xe2\x80\x9d which as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you know has a legal meaning in terms of malice aforethought.\xc2\xa0 Are we to read anything into the first -- this being the first time he\xe2\x80\x99s used the word \xe2\x80\x9cmurder\xe2\x80\x9d to describe what happened to those Afghans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Afghan civilians, innocent Afghan civilians, were killed.\xc2\xa0 How that happened and why that happened is under investigation.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go beyond that, and I think that he was not going beyond that.\xc2\xa0 But it is a fact that these Afghan civilians, innocent civilians, were killed, as I understand it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this was a tragic event, and as the President said, it is not reflective of who we are.\xc2\xa0 It is not reflective of the values of the American military.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly believes, and I know that everyone is this administration and everyone over at the Pentagon believes that we need to make sure that this is fully investigated and that anyone involved will be held accountable.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well -- and that was the other thing I wanted to ask.\xc2\xa0 I know Ben asked about this already, but the Pentagon seems fairly certain in their statements that there was only one person involved.\xc2\xa0 Is the fact that the President is saying \xe2\x80\x9canyone involved\xe2\x80\x9d a suggestion that there might be others in the chain of command who are held responsible for other reasons?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- and I understand that a lot of things have been happening today, and briefings that might have happened, or have happened across the river may not have been caught up to here, but I think the Pentagon discussed this.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding is that they\'re simply saying that the investigation will include discussions with a number of individuals, but that it is still our understanding that there was one shooter involved.\xc2\xa0 But for these details I think the Pentagon is the best place for information.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to have a full understanding of what the President was trying to convey and to whom he was --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President was reflecting what the Defense Department has been saying on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just not to suggest that anybody else was involved, but not to preclude any conclusion that might come out of the Pentagon investigation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s right.\xc2\xa0 He is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s making clear that the investigation needs to take its course, that you can\'t make prejudgments about it, and that anyone who might have information about it will be spoken to as part of the investigation.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I think the Defense Department is probably the best place to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The only reason I ask is because obviously some of the initial reports from the villagers involved were that there were -- it might have been misunderstandings from seeing troops that were looking for this soldier, or troops that were trying to find out what he had been doing -- but there were initial reports, specifically I think to Reuters, in fact, from villagers that there had been more than one soldier involved.\xc2\xa0 I understand the military doesn\'t think that\'s true.\xc2\xa0 But when the President gives an open-ended statement like that, it just -- it feeds into --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement was reflective of the fact that, as the Pentagon is making clear, investigators continue to work closely with Army and Afghan authorities.\xc2\xa0 They also continue to interview a range of individuals with potential knowledge of these attacks.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have further information about the nature of those interviews.\xc2\xa0 Initial indications continue to indicate that there was one shooter.\xc2\xa0 And so I\'m not -- I want to be clear about that.\xc2\xa0 But I also want to be clear that the investigation will include interviews with a range of individuals with potential knowledge.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I just go back to something you said at the very beginning in answer to Ben?\xc2\xa0 You said it was totally false to assert a report that there were officials in the administration advocating specific numbers for troop withdrawals. And I want to just make sure I understand that correctly.\xc2\xa0 Are you saying by that that there is not a debate internally over the pace of withdrawal or whether withdrawal could be accelerated?\xc2\xa0 Because that would run counter to previous troop debates, where there\'s always been a very vigorous debate between those who want to be aggressive and those who argue for being somewhat more cautious.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that -- I mean, I can\'t account for every conversation that\'s happened around the water cooler or in front of the takeout window at the Navy Mess, but I can tell you that the report that there are three options being considered is absolutely false.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the report that a specific individual was pushing a specific option is false.\xc2\xa0 There is no specific option or specific policy at this point.\xc2\xa0 These are -- this will be the product of ongoing discussions with our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can\'t really account for the nature of some of the reporting on this, but I can tell you that the specifics that I just raised are inaccurate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more question on this.\xc2\xa0 Is that to say, then, that the notion of an accelerated withdrawal has not come up in policy deliberations, or -- the phrase "option," which could imply something very formal that\'s laid on the table.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we have made clear that the President, as part of his policy, will -- the President\'s policy will result in the bringing home of 33,000 troops by the end of this summer. Then, as per the decision made by NATO at Lisbon, the transition -- the full transition to Afghan security lead will take place by the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has made clear that American troops will continue to be drawn down after those 33,000 are withdrawn.\xc2\xa0 But the pace of that drawdown will depend on assessments made by commanders, by the President, by our NATO allies.\xc2\xa0 And there is not a discussion about specific numbers or specific options at this time.\xc2\xa0 It\'s simply not accurate.\xc2\xa0 So we are in the midst of bringing those 33,000 home.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly premature to talk specific numbers about the timing of drawdowns beyond that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow on that, the general concept of accelerating the drawdown -- is that being discussed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I just got that question.\xc2\xa0 Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t account for every conversation that might take place, but I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, in an official atmosphere or an official meeting, we are focused on the implementation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Afghanistan strategy, which is all about the fight against al Qaeda, the stabilization of Afghanistan and the gradual withdrawal of U.S. forces -- in this case, the surge forces.\xc2\xa0 And that is happening and will continue to happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The NATO summit is really not all that far out when you think about it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that in concept this isn\xe2\x80\x99t being discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that the nature of our deployment in Afghanistan, how that deployment will look beyond the end of the withdrawal of the surge forces will obviously be a discussion with our NATO partners.\xc2\xa0 But there is not now and there will not be at the NATO meeting an announcement of a number or a troop withdrawal schedule.\xc2\xa0 That is not the purpose of the discussions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m privy to every conversation that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place in every corner of this building, but I can tell you that the overall policy is focused on implementing the strategy the President put in place, which, by the way -- and this is important that everybody understand -- has as its component the withdrawal of 33,000 U.S. troops by the middle of September -- so even as we continue to transfer security authority to the Afghan forces, as we continue to take the fight to al Qaeda and we continue to stabilize regions of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can ask about the rare earth minerals -- Senator Schumer and three other Democratic senators are urging the administration to do more than the President announced he was doing today.\xc2\xa0 Specifically, Senator Schumer advocates urging the World Bank to block financing for Chinese mining projects and for the Interior Department to block Chinese-funded mining projects in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 Why not do those things in addition or instead of what --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What the President announced today was the action that we are taking.\xc2\xa0 And the action at the WTO is part of a consistent effort and a stepped-up effort, in comparison to the previous administration, in taking cases to the WTO that have to do with unfair trade, and reflect this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ensuring that American businesses and American workers get to compete on a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 This is a very strong action and reflects that commitment that this President has held since he took office.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, without getting into specifics of this case, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about other actions, you can be sure that this administration is focused on leveling the playing field through a variety of means, including our dialogue with the Chinese and other countries where we have issues, trade issues, between us.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a multifaceted effort.\xc2\xa0 But the announcement today is a serious announcement.\xc2\xa0 And again, the measure of that is evident by the actions the administration has taken with the WTO in the past, and the result of those actions that have had significant benefits for American workers here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this undercut the President\xe2\x80\x99s trying to do something when it comes to trade practices with China to have Democratic senators essentially criticizing him or saying he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing enough?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the fact that leaders in Washington take this matter very seriously should not be lost on our trading partners around the globe.\xc2\xa0 We believe that we ought to be able to compete on a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this action is about.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the action with regards to tires was about, and the many other activities in this space that we\xe2\x80\x99ve engaged in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to specific reactions by foreign governments, but the comments that you reference I think reflect a general desire to see a more level playing field for U.S. companies and U.S. workers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAri, and then Roger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With the health care case coming up before the Supreme Court, can you talk about how important this is to the President and how closely he\xe2\x80\x99s planning on following the arguments?\xc2\xa0 Has he met with Justice officials who are involved in it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, and I think I\'ve made that case here on several occasions.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that and hope that the Court will recognize that and uphold it.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, we\'re focused on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which is already providing significant benefits to millions and millions of Americans:\xc2\xa0 to young Americans who have insurance that they otherwise would not have had; to seniors who are getting access to preventive services that they would not have had access to, or free preventive services they would not have had access to; seniors who are enjoying huge savings on their prescription drug bills and the like.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\'re focused on the implementation.\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of milestones along the way in the implementation, and that necessitates a lot of focus on behalf of the health care team.\xc2\xa0 And the case itself we\'ll leave to the Supreme Court.\xc2\xa0 But I believe in fact that we\'ll be traveling on, as I understand it, on the day or the days of those arguments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he has not -- the Solicitor General\'s Office --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe he has.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Going back to Jeff\'s question about China and the WTO actions and the politics of it.\xc2\xa0 The announcement comes on a day of the Republican primaries.\xc2\xa0 It comes when the critics have been saying the President hasn\'t stood up to China enough.\xc2\xa0 One of the analysts in town who has been covering the rare earth issue says, "I think it\'s transparent he\'s doing this now for electoral purposes."\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll just respond in the way that I\'ve responded already, which is ridiculous unless you think that the President and all the actions that he took were taken for those reasons even in the first few months of his administration, which is, of course, patently absurd.\xc2\xa0 The President\'s commitment on this has been evident from the very beginning, and this is simply part of that effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact that it takes place on a day when there are Republican primaries -- competitive Republican primaries, I mean, throw some spaghetti at a calendar and find a day when there isn\'t a competitive Republican primary.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s possible that could be the case for many weeks going forward, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut we\'re focused on the -- the President\'s schedule is a complex organism, and this was the appropriate day to do it.\xc2\xa0 He has an important ally coming into town, the Prime Minister of Great Britain; he has a state visit -- an official visit, rather, and a state dinner tomorrow night, and certainly many other matters to attend to.\xc2\xa0 So the timing of this had everything to do with his schedule and the fact of the case, and not politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the follow-up would -- the rare earth thing has been around for at least two years, maybe even three.\xc2\xa0 Does it take that long for it to ask the WTO --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure -- because there\'s an issue, I mean, there are various steps in how these things are developed, and then the decision is made to -- a pretty consequential decision and serious decision is made to take a case to the WTO.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t do that on the first day that you\'ve discovered you have a problem. And then at that -- I mean, I don\'t think that\'s a surprise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I mean, the specifics of -- I would refer you to the agencies involved, but of course this is a very thought-out process by which you make the decision to take a case up, and then you make that case in the presentation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No politics involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve answered this.\xc2\xa0 Again, Chinese tires, to start.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just a slight follow.\xc2\xa0 Does this have -- no, no, does this have anything to do with the discussions with the Chinese Vice President that was here recently?\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the President or the Vice President discussed with him?\xc2\xa0 And if so, was there some turning point in those discussions that led them to believe there was not going to be further cooperation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, in those conversations, as is the case in our conversations with senior members of the Chinese government, the overall issue of trade is often a subject.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know one way or the other whether this came up in any of the conversations that the Vice President of China had with the President and the Vice President here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is -- as Roger points out, this has been an issue of contention for some time so it\xe2\x80\x99s -- and there have been discussions, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, at a variety of levels about it with the Chinese.\xc2\xa0 And those discussions in the course of the problem have led us to this point where the President announced a new trade case on the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jared and Steve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, am I --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t really tell who you are yet with your new beard.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, Energy Secretary Steven Chu said before -- or disavowed before a congressional panel comments he made in 2008 about wanting to see European-style gas prices.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, did the President ask him to disavow those comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is an excellent opportunity to make the point that folks who cover this issue, who try to suggest that the statement of someone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even in government at the time is somehow a more significant indicator of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy than the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy are engaging in politics on this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President, on his watch over the past three years, has taken significant actions to increase -- to continue the increase and to increase domestic oil and gas production.\xc2\xa0 It is part of his oil -- I mean, it is part of his all-of-the-above approach to our energy needs and security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the fun for folks to find these quotes and suggest that they have some deeper meaning, and maybe that would be the case on day one of a presidency.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re in the fourth year of this presidency.\xc2\xa0 And this President has a very clear record of aggressively pursuing domestic oil and gas production in a safe and responsible way on public lands as well as private -- ensuring that it continues on private lands and waters -- and in pursuing aggressively alternative energy industries so that we can compete globally in the future in those industries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tPursuing -- on his watch after all, we have now permitted the first nuclear power plant in 30 years.\xc2\xa0 We are well on our way towards doubling our renewable energy production.\xc2\xa0 We are less dependent on foreign oil now by a significant measure than we were three years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are the facts.\xc2\xa0 I saw right before I came out here the comment that you made, and I certainly think that you can report on that based on the Energy Secretary, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- now because of the criticism --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would ask Secretary Chu.\xc2\xa0 I think, partly because of what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, there has been an attempt -- a partisan -- largely partisan attempt to try to take comments like that and pretend that those are policy when in fact the policy reflects the contrary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you talk about why the President thought it was important to come out again today very publicly to talk about the Afghan shooting, particularly his comments direct to the Afghan people?\xc2\xa0 Are there -- is there concern that U.S. troops could face reprisals?\xc2\xa0 Did he feel the need to give some cover to Karzai?\xc2\xa0 Is there some kind of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously the President was asked this yesterday in some regional TV interviews and addressed this issue, but he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to you in the national press and the White House Press Corps, and felt and we felt it was important that, given the tragic events and rather dramatic events of Sunday, that he address the issue with you here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also the case that he wanted to clearly express publicly what he did about his condolences to the Afghan people, as he did in his phone conversation with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read more into it than that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sorry, last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question on China.\xc2\xa0 First, Rick Santorum said he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to bring out a trade war with China, while Romney say this is the last thing he want to see.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the stand of the White House?\xc2\xa0 Is the White House worried about a trade war with China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This administration is focused on our very important relationship with China.\xc2\xa0 We, as the President said -- the President believes, we believe that China\xe2\x80\x99s rise is a good thing for the Chinese people and for the global community, a good thing for the United States.\xc2\xa0 It is also important that as China becomes a bigger and bigger economic power, that China play by the same set of rules that other major economic powers play by.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the President has taken.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not one or the other; it\xe2\x80\x99s both.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s absolute engagement and it\xe2\x80\x99s a very important and complex relationship on a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0 It also, when we have differences, as we do on this matter, making them clear and taking action on them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, the China commerce minister believes that the bill that President signed into law today should not only break the WTO rules but also sort of violate the U.S. domestic trade laws, which America -- trade laws.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard those comments.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President signed the bill because he thought it was -- it merited signing.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comments with regards to that official\'s statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:05 P.M.
