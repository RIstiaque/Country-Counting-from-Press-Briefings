GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir.\xc2\xa0 Two topics I\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask you about, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On the Mideast, does President Obama condemn Israel\xe2\x80\x99s raid of the aid ship headed to Gaza?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ben, let me simply restate what the international community and the United States supported early this morning at the U.N. Security Council through a presidential statement.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting from the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza.\xc2\xa0 The Council in this context condemns those acts, which resulted in the loss of at least 10 civilians and many wounded, and expresses its condolences to their families.\xc2\xa0 The Security Council requests the immediate release of the ships, as well as civilians held by Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that would seem to cover President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s personal feeling, while some of the allies are looking for a stronger statement from him directly.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, this is supported not just by the United States but by the international community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the President feel like he is still in a position of gathering facts about what happened or have you ascertained enough to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Security Council, the statement that I read, calls for an investigation that is prompt, impartial, credible and transparent, conforming to international standards of exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously supportive of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On oil, on the spill, was this latest attempt to try to contain the well one that BP came up with or is this an administrative directive?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Is this the top cap?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe in conjunction with a number of scientists, this was one of the options that has been before us for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 Obviously any action undertaken by BP to deal with the wellbore and to deal with the well itself requires the signoff of the federal on-scene coordinator.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s level of confidence about this effort given the lack of success of the ones before it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the odds prediction business in terms of this, as Carol Browner said on television this morning.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this has gone on far too long.\xc2\xa0 I think everybody is enormously frustrated with that, and rightfully so.\xc2\xa0 We are closely monitoring the events as they start and are hopeful that this is a situation that will contain the oil coming from the well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re in a little different situation.\xc2\xa0 This is -- this procedure -- and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you all had a chance to listen to Admiral Allen\xe2\x80\x99s briefing a little while ago; the transcript will be put out by the Joint Information Center and we will forward that around as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The solutions for -- the solution with the top kill, first in stabilizing the well with heavy drilling mud, ultimately would lead to the cement capping of that well.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re now working on something slightly different in terms of containing, through this cap, what is coming out of that well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a couple more quick ones on this.\xc2\xa0 The President said when the top kill procedure failed over the weekend that the leak was as enraging as it is heartbreaking.\xc2\xa0 Have you seen the President enraged about this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Throughout this process, absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that has come through to the American people?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the American people are frustrated.\xc2\xa0 I think the people of the Gulf are frustrated.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is frustrated.\xc2\xa0 I think the White House is frustrated.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t see how anybody could look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the Gulf and not be frustrated and heartbroken -- absolutely.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there any consideration given to the President cancelling his foreign trip?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We can\xe2\x80\x99t hear you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Your mic isn\xe2\x80\x99t on.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 My mic\xe2\x80\x99s not on?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I said all those really important things and you guys --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Start from the beginning.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, so I was going to tell you tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s lottery numbers, but -- (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Can somebody figure out -- did it work now?\xc2\xa0 Are you sure?\xc2\xa0 This is sort of awkward.\xc2\xa0 This never happens to Bill at karaoke.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you complain we all ask the same question over and over again.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Now there\xe2\x80\x99s at least a good excuse.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0 First time anybody has ever clapped for what I said.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Yes, exactly -- don\xe2\x80\x99t start from the top.\xc2\xa0 Lord knows I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- Bill will lip-sync the transcript when it comes out, so you can -- go ahead, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go to my last question, which was, is there any consideration being given to postponing or canceling the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming foreign trip to deal with this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before returning to the Gaza flotilla incident, quick question about the oil spill.\xc2\xa0 The President said that if laws were broken, then justice would be done for those responsible.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a sense of when a criminal probe might emerge in the spill case?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously the Attorney General is in the Gulf today to meet with U.S. attorneys and state attorneys general.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice for those answers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and in light of what happened with the Gaza aid flotilla, is the President considering at least backing international calls to lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip by Israeli forces?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, look, obviously, as we have said before, we are concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza and continue to work with the Israelis and international partners in order to improve those conditions.\xc2\xa0 And as the U.N. Security Council statement says, obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s an untenable situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should the blockade be lifted?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re working with those to improve the humanitarian conditions.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s helpful to understand that this is a blockade of -- to not allow weapons to get into the hands of Hamas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And humanitarian aid.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And we have said that -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what are the President\xe2\x80\x99s concerns that the Gaza incident -- the flotilla incident might -- has poisoned the atmosphere to the extent that indirect talks between Israel and the Palestinians won\xe2\x80\x99t go forward?\xc2\xa0 Will there be delay of some sort here?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I would say, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re <br/>\n-- the President spoke on three occasions yesterday with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and obviously we regret that but understand completely why he went back to Israel and had to cancel the meeting.</p>\n<p>The schedule for Mr. Abbas coming is still the same.\xc2\xa0 And we think more than ever we need a comprehensive Middle East peace plan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mitchell is back in the region tomorrow, I believe --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for the Palestine Investment Conference.\xc2\xa0 Will he be shuttling between Abbas and Netanyahu for talks?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t off the top of my head know his schedule, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll -- let me see if I have anything additional to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you expect indirect talks will go forward?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama believe the Israelis\xe2\x80\x99 version of events?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama believe -- does he believe the Israeli government\xe2\x80\x99s version of events?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the U.N. Security Council resolution calling for an investigation so that everybody knows exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about that investigation.\xc2\xa0 Is it important that it be run by the Israelis?\xc2\xa0 Does the President want the international community to be involved in the investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that -- obviously what I said earlier, the resolution calls for a prompt and transparent investigation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are open to ways to assure a credible investigation, including international participation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there were Americans on the flotilla.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any -- do you have any information about whether any of them were hurt?\xc2\xa0 There was an unconfirmed report that an American student lost an eye in the incident.\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in contact with the Israelis in order to get an accounting as to whether any American citizens -- obviously American citizens were -- acting as private citizens -- were on some of these ships.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working with the Israelis to determine if any of those individuals were injured, and as the resolution says, would call on the Israelis to release both the ships and any of those people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at all that after all his work to repair relations between the U.S. and the Muslim world that a situation like this destroys it overnight?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The U.S. relationship with the Muslim --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The U.S. relationship with the Muslim world by standing so steadfastly with Israel?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again -- again, I would point you to <br/>\n-- I think it was a pretty clear statement by the international community that the United States --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t call it that -- I mean, it condemns acts that were taken that led to the loss of life, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say whose acts.\xc2\xa0 It could have been the flotilla\xe2\x80\x99s acts, or it could have been the IDF\xe2\x80\x99s acts.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear from that statement.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our opinion is this is a pretty clear statement, and obviously --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Whose acts -- whose acts are you talking about in that statement?\xc2\xa0 Is it the IDF or is it the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about series of facts that will be determined by an appropriate investigation as I just said.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no specificity as to whose acts it\xe2\x80\x99s condemning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe you have information as to exactly how this went this down that the rest of the international community may not be completely clear on, Jake.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, and let me get --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it looks like you don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what -- you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We can play circular ball all day long, Jake.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we condemn the loss of life and we regret it deeply.\xc2\xa0 I think that is knowable, correct?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s correct.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay, good.\xc2\xa0 So I would simply say -- reiterate what is in the statement.\xc2\xa0 In terms of our relationship with the Muslim world, I think the President has obviously spent a lot of time on improving our relationship with countries throughout the world, and special time and care on our relationship with the Muslim world.\xc2\xa0 I do not think that this will have a great impact on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I just wonder -- I wanted to talk about oil a little bit.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned Thad Allen briefed earlier today.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take until day 43 for the administration to decide that you have to speak with one voice and have Thad Allen doing it, not BP briefing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I think there were joint briefings that were held at the Joint Information Center in Robert that had a component of both BP and the Coast Guard.\xc2\xa0 Today is the beginning of hurricane season.\xc2\xa0 Rear Admiral Landry, who was the federal on-scene coordinator, has naturally rotated back to her position of hurricane preparedness in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, given the prediction by NOAA that this is likely to be a more active season than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past, those preparations are enormously important.</p>\n<p>This has been a little bit of a difficult situation because, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve explained here on a number of -- a number of times, there are a lot of different agencies that go into what\xe2\x80\x99s made up of the larger federal response.\xc2\xa0 When Admiral Allen was here last week we talked about some of the commitments that he had last week in his retirement from the Coast Guard as he even -- as he remains the National Incident Commander.\xc2\xa0 The briefings that he has won\xe2\x80\x99t be at a regular time, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be at a regular location.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be wherever he is, whenever they\xe2\x80\x99re conducive to his schedule, given the enormous amount of work that he has to do in ensuring our response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Administration officials are also telling us today that part of the problem was that BP was not always giving accurate information in their briefing.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, administration officials didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you that today, they told you that on Sunday when Carol Browner on two news shows wanted to ensure that people adequately understood the possible risks involved to the top cap procedure which --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let met finish this -- when we --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- why did it take until day 41 at that point?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 When we cut the cap, our scientists, as part of the flow rate group, estimate you could see a 20 percent increase in the overall outflow of hydrocarbons.\xc2\xa0 This was something that our scientists and others had told us about.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we were uncomfortable with Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing when somebody from BP didn\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but people have -- critics have been for weeks saying that BP\xe2\x80\x99s information was not adding up.\xc2\xa0 You had outside experts saying that it was leaking far more than 5,000 barrels a day.\xc2\xa0 They were saying that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which is why we set up a flow rate group to determine adequately using the best technology possible, Ed --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but then it took until Sunday, day 41, for Carol Browner to say, you know what, BP\xe2\x80\x99s information is not accurate.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no, let\xe2\x80\x99s not -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99re confusing about eight issues into one.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand -- no, the flow rate is an important aspect to talk about, and let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss it because I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve briefed since the flow rate group talked about this.</p>\n<p>The initial estimates that were done used overhead photography to measure the amount of oil on the surface, right?\xc2\xa0 We know that through the use of subsea dispersants it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that not everything is going to the top, right?\xc2\xa0 So -- and even with the picture that many of you guys are using on television, it\xe2\x80\x99s a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not sufficiently of the dimension to fully measure the flow, right?</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve never been dependent upon BP for information about the flow.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard many in the administration discuss accurately that -- because fines for BP will largely be determined by the amount of pollution emitted, that they may not altogether have the same transparent public interest that we do in ensuring the public knows exactly -- to the best of our scientific ability -- what\xe2\x80\x99s coming from the well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President today in the Rose Garden talked about throwing more resources at it, the personnel, something he talked about in the region on Friday, about tripling the personnel along the coast, et cetera, in key areas, and yet it still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been capped, despite all those resources.\xc2\xa0 Are you worried --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, those -- again, let\xe2\x80\x99s understand, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- those are resources -- the tripling of resources are in the parishes in which we see the greatest -- where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the greatest amount of oil hit land, right?\xc2\xa0 So obviously there continues to be a frustration with the well not being capped, even as we try to do everything in our power.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it is important, as many administration officials have said, our interests line up on this, the American people\xe2\x80\x99s interest and the company\xe2\x80\x99s interest line up on trying to do everything humanly possible to plug that leak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but I\xe2\x80\x99m acknowledging the President is saying he\xe2\x80\x99s throwing unprecedented resources at it, and yet you still can\xe2\x80\x99t solve it -- does that cut into the administration\xe2\x80\x99s credibility?\xc2\xa0 The President ran in part on this idea of competence in government, being able to solve these big problems.\xc2\xa0 I understand it\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I think I\xe2\x80\x99m hearing you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re throwing unprecedented resources and you can\xe2\x80\x99t solve it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re -- the unprecedented resources that are referred to are the resources that are on land to deal with the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s coming in.\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think that inherent in the premise of your question is somehow we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s something that we know that we could do that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing to cap the well.\xc2\xa0 I can dissuade you of that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the American people basically are told nobody really knows how to fix this thing?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the premise of your question is that somebody in and around this room knows how to do it and we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing, the President at his news conference was talking about how from day one the administration has essentially been in charge, that any big decision you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to sign off on.\xc2\xa0 But the previous week when various people here, starting with Jennifer Loven, were pressing you on why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the government step in, you repeatedly said the government can\xe2\x80\x99t, that this is BP\xe2\x80\x99s, that the federal government is not in control, legally you can\xe2\x80\x99t really be in control.\xc2\xa0 So which one is it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, no -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve always -- no, we\xe2\x80\x99ve always directed those resources.\xc2\xa0 And as -- whether it was the top kill, whether it was the top cap, any of the exercises that needed to be signed off on by the federal on-scene coordinator in order to make happen, those were done.</p>\n<p>Ms. Thomas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The -- our initial reaction to this flotilla massacre, deliberate massacre, an international crime, was pitiful.\xc2\xa0 What do you mean you regret when something should be so strongly condemned?\xc2\xa0 And if any other nation in the world had done it, we would have been up in arms.\xc2\xa0 What is the sacrosanct, iron-clad relationship where a country that deliberately kills people and boycotts -- and we aid and abet the boycott?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the initial reaction regretted the loss of life as we tried and still continue to try to gather the relevant --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regret won\xe2\x80\x99t bring them back.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Nothing can bring them back, Helen.\xc2\xa0 We know that for sure because I think if you could, that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be up for debate.\xc2\xa0 We are -- we believe that a credible and transparent investigation has to look into the facts.\xc2\xa0 And as I said earlier, we\xe2\x80\x99re open to international participation in that investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did you think of it so late?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Why did we think of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you initially condemn it?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the statements that were released speak directly to that.</p>\n<p>Chip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that the President is enraged.\xc2\xa0 Is he enraged at BP specifically?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s enraged at the time that it\xe2\x80\x99s taken, yes.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s been enraged over the course of this, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed, about the fact that when you\xe2\x80\x99re told something is fail-safe and it clearly isn\xe2\x80\x99t, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the cause for quite a bit of frustration.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the reasons that -- which is one of the reasons you heard him discuss the setting up of the oil commission in order to create a regulatory framework that ensures something like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Frustration and rage are very different emotions, though.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t -- have we really seen rage from the President on this?\xc2\xa0 I think most people would say no.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen rage from him, Chip.\xc2\xa0 I have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe it?\xc2\xa0 Does he yell and scream?\xc2\xa0 What does he do?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He said -- he has been in a whole bunch of different meetings -- clenched jaw -- even in the midst of these briefings, saying everything has to be done.\xc2\xa0 I think this was an anecdote shared last week, to plug the damn hole.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President still have confidence in BP?\xc2\xa0 Is he losing confidence in BP?\xc2\xa0 Is he trying to separate himself from BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on what?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, based on, number one, Thad Allen basically taking over the daily briefings.\xc2\xa0 Number two, today, that shot across the bow about prosecution; Eric Holder being sent down there.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s getting tough with BP.\xc2\xa0 Is that because he is separating himself from BP and making clear it\xe2\x80\x99s their problem?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say this, Chip, we have -- it has been their problem since day one.\xc2\xa0 It is also our problem, and we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything that we can to both plug the leak as well as to respond at the subsea and on the surface to the pollution that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s understand the reason that Thad is doing this -- again, I spoke about this with Ed -- in terms of being uncomfortable with the nature of their answer as it related to the increased amount of flow --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, they kind of lied, didn\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xc2\xa0 Why would he be just uncomfortable?\xc2\xa0 That would -- there I can imagine rage.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they said nothing more was going to come out but the experts say --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, I think that if you look at what Carol said on Sunday, despite the fact that it is not our oil well, we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s tremendously important that the American people have the best information as accurately and as quickly as possible, which is why she said clearly that, one, there was -- there could be an increase of 20 percent of hydrocarbon coming from the riser when it\xe2\x80\x99s sheared off.\xc2\xa0 We discussed -- I mean, look, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the prime example of what she said on Sunday.</p>\n<p>She also said, I think obviously very accurately, that the long-term solution to this is the drilling of relief wells, right?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s likely to take until mid-August.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, so I\xe2\x80\x99m saying you\xe2\x80\x99ve got this difference over the 20 percent, which the administration, you say they\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable -- it seems like that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty mild response to it.\xc2\xa0 And then at the press conference, the President said that they have an interest in minimizing things.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just said that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just said that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re suggesting BP is lying to the administration.\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you have a stronger response then than saying you\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do I think that BP was forthcoming on what the impact would be of cutting the riser off?\xc2\xa0 No, obviously.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re intentionally misleading -- in other words, lying to the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in their meetings on what their scientists are telling them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply conveying to the American people precisely what our scientists are telling us is likely to be the result of cutting the top of the riser.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President overall trust BP?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We will continue to push BP to do whatever we feel is necessary to respond to the leak and to adequately respond to the spread of the oil and to ensure that they pay for all of it so that taxpayers don\xe2\x80\x99t bear any of this cost.</p>\n<p>Savannah.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Recognizing you\xe2\x80\x99re in fact-ascertaining mode, let\xe2\x80\x99s take some facts not in dispute -- the ship was boarded in international waters.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Israel violated international law in doing that?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration think so?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not asked -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not an international law expert.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have a position on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it appropriate, do you think -- does the administration think for a humanitarian ship to attempt to break a blockade?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the international law implications of all this, Savannah.\xc2\xa0 I think the administration --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking was it appropriate for a humanitarian ship --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- and international community has spoken on the actions and look forward to a full accounting of the facts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So rather than the U.S. having an independent reaction, you\xe2\x80\x99re aligning yourself entirely with the U.N. Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s statement.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean the U.S. ratifies and accepts everything coming out of the Security Council in this regard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Things we vote for, yes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we supported the -- what came out of the U.N. Security Council.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So verbiage about there being a humanitarian crisis in Gaza --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the blockade needs to be looked into?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not -- we didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t always support the first several paragraphs.\xc2\xa0 We supported and voted for the entire resolution, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you concede that the notion of boarding a vessel in order to stop it from breaking the blockade was poorly conceived?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Savannah, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to be a -- I am many things; I am not an international law expert and I am not a military tactician.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I serve some roles but neither -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in a military where I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked my opinion on either international law --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously I\xe2\x80\x99m asking for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come around.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the administration considered invoking the Stafford Act regarding the oil spill to speed resources to --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Stafford Act is a set of -- is what is typically done when there is not a responsible party for a disaster, right?\xc2\xa0 So if a hurricane has caused flooding in Tennessee, governors normally request a Stafford Act declaration to cover damages.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it in discussing this with the lawyers, the appropriate set of responses is contained in the Oil Pollution Act.</p>\n<p>Obviously I would say -- let me just add, there are aspects of different types of Stafford responses such as the program that SBA has began I think the 10th of May offering low-interest loans and providing loan forgiveness for people that have been hurt as an economic consequence of a disaster.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You spoke earlier about the balance of responsibility between the federal government being in charge and -- or perhaps earlier indications they were relying on BP to run this.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any shift in your mind in the balance between who was controlling this operation between the federal government and BP since this started?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, again, I would refer you to what the President said last week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that there has not been any shift since the beginning?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, we have, again -- and as Thad Allen said here a week -- not a week ago, I guess a week and a day ago -- if there are things that he needs BP to do, then he calls BP.\xc2\xa0 And if they don\xe2\x80\x99t -- ask them to do them, requires them to do them, and that has the force of law.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious that there was tragic over-reaction on both sides, but could you please look into two competing conflicting reports -- one report says Hamas and some terrorist groups provided the financing for this flotilla; another report claims that Israel has actually been giving a lot of humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.\xc2\xa0 If you could look into both of those before --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any direction that we have on either one of those.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the U.S. know in advance about the Israel raid on the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And part of the Indonesia trip is going to be about Muslim outreach.\xc2\xa0 How will that be shaped given this latest news?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, obviously Indonesia is the largest Muslim country in the world.\xc2\xa0 It is important to our efforts and we work in conjunction with them on counterterrorism and a whole host of issues of mutual concern.\xc2\xa0 That trip -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any change in the planning for what will be done on that trip as a result of this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Robert Reich says BP should be put under a temporary receivership to ensure that the President is in charge.\xc2\xa0 What do you think of that idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What law would that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure what legal mechanism one would have to do that.\xc2\xa0 Do you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But do you think there should be an effort --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- maybe I misunderstood -- what did he -- under what law did he ask that be done?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure legally, but there\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, before I wade in -- I just told Savannah I was -- a fact she I think readily knew -- that I was not an international expert.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m probably not a domestic law expert either, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to look at whatever Mr. Reich has.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the flow rate projections you guys put together, is it possible that if this maneuver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed and the cutting of the riser, could that increase for some period of time the flow rate by 20 percent if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a possibility that the American people should brace themselves for?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as Carol said clearly on Sunday, that -- well, the flow rate group estimated -- I think this is right -- 12,000 to 19,000 barrels of oil a day.\xc2\xa0 We believe that that could increase, say, 20 percent with the cut of the riser.\xc2\xa0 So that puts the bottom at -- I can do that math quicker than I can the other -- 15,000 for the bottom end of that.\xc2\xa0 I think cutting -- and, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll send out Admiral Allen\xe2\x80\x99s briefing -- there will be a time between the cut of that riser and the placement of a cap.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen varying estimates, but let\xe2\x80\x99s assume several days of increased hydrocarbon pollution in the time in which it takes to install some sort of top cap.\xc2\xa0 Some of that, again, as Thad Allen said, is based on the cut that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the saw.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, considering the history of all the other efforts undertaken technologically so far, that the cut won\xe2\x80\x99t be as clean as they need, there will be too much push, there will be too much --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple -- as Thad said, there\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of different caps, again, based on that cut, that may seal more hydrocarbon pollution than the other.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is not without risk in terms of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it without risk in making things worse?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not without risk at all, no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very -- I mean, I think as the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement said on Saturday, that -- look, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little that is done now based on where we are in the efforts to contain the well, again, understanding that obviously we have done things in varying degree of risk.\xc2\xa0 If this was less risky than, say, the top kill, we would have done that before.</p>\n<p>Again -- and I think just to be completely transparent, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Admiral Allen say today that there is also some concern about the condition of the well and the wellbore relating to the explosion that happened on the 20th of April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you say this disagreement over the flow rate is the only incident in which BP has not been as forthcoming as the federal government would prefer, or part of a series of incidents where it has not been as honest as you would --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I forget exactly what Tony Hayward said last week in terms of the degree to which -- whether or not there was any real pollution involved.\xc2\xa0 Obviously I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anybody -- how anybody could come to that conclusion.\xc2\xa0 We -- I clearly on Saturday did not feel comfortable with their explanation on the possible increase in flow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday it was noted in the daily assessment of things that the -- one of the relief wells being drilled is 10 days ahead of schedule.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you satisfied with BP\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in that regard?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I understand it, that well is 12,000 -- about, as of last night, about 12,000 feet down.\xc2\xa0 That includes the roughly 5,000 feet of ocean.\xc2\xa0 As you said, that\xe2\x80\x99s ahead of schedule and that is the long-term, permanent solution to the problem that we have at the well site right now.\xc2\xa0 So regardless of the success of the operation currently ongoing, that\xe2\x80\x99s the permanent solution, which is -- again, in top kill, forcing the mud down and creating the stabilizing pressure ultimately would have led to the cementing of the well.\xc2\xa0 Drilling that relief well, placing another blowout preventer obviously on that well as it\xe2\x80\x99s drilled and ultimately cementing it is the long-term solution for what\xe2\x80\x99s going on now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us the degree to which internally the conversations come from the President -- hey, can you sketch out for me what this is going to look like if we have to wait until August for this relief well to be the final, ultimate solution; what kind of ecological damage are we talking about?\xc2\xa0 And is there a point at which we have calculated, no matter how much we legitimately and legally we hold BP, Transocean, Halliburton responsible, there may not be enough money to deal with all this and we may need a federal response, a taxpayer response that deals with this --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard the latter, because the responsible party per the law will pay that back.\xc2\xa0 We have, in sending legislation to improve a number of the regulatory structures around the relationship between oil and the government, one of the things that we called for was a lifting of the economic liability cap to an unlimited level that we feel comfortable -- that\xe2\x80\x99s where we feel comfortable at given the enormity of the disaster that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at right now.</p>\n<p>In terms of the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, wait, are we talking about both sides of Florida, parts of the Mid-Atlantic -- I mean, all these sorts of things, has that been conveyed to the President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the degree to which the full -- a full damage assessment has been worked up to that level based on the Loop Current and the wind direction and things like that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Major, we can -- taking the flow rate figures that the group came out with last week, understanding, again, the floor now at 15,000 after the riser is cut, look, you can begin to quickly do the math to figure out the millions of gallons of oil that will be in the Gulf and could spread, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a -- those are sobering figures.\xc2\xa0 And you can understand, as the President said today, we are dealing with the largest environmental disaster in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The long-term, permanent solution -- is August the outside date by which that is expected to work, or could it be even later?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I assume it could be both earlier and later.\xc2\xa0 I think the target date was mid-August in terms of drilling to the level at which you would need to go in order to construct that relief well.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you, there are credible reports that the al Qaeda number three has been killed in Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 How important a blow is that?\xc2\xa0 Some have described it as being as important or even more important than getting bin Laden.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, in talking with -- obviously al Qaeda has commented on the loss of this individual and we welcome his demise.\xc2\xa0 In speaking with John Brennan and others today, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask specifically the question of in comparison.\xc2\xa0 John was quite clear in saying this is the biggest target to be either killed or captured in five years and is somebody who intricately understood and was on top of the financing of al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 So it is a -- unquestionably is a severe blow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was the President informed?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I believe the answer to that is sometime yesterday, but I will double-check on that.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I wonder if you could talk about whether the President is worried that the spill is going to so consume everything until August that the rest of his agenda is hobbled to some extent.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of things on his plate.\xc2\xa0 He promised at one point that this year would all be about jobs, jobs, jobs.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously spending --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, the truth is we\xe2\x80\x99ll get -- before you -- look, I think we sort of periodically obviously get economic figures in order to gauge where we are in the recovery -- today an increase in the manufacturing index above what had been expected, and the largest spending increase in construction in 10 years aided by the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a sense of where we are in the continuum of that jobs recovery with the new figures on Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there an opportunity cost on all the different things that the President had in mind for this year that may be --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, look, I was asked several weeks ago, what did this particular incident do to the likelihood of a clean energy bill or a comprehensive energy bill.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think you -- it becomes clearer -- and the President said this last week in visiting a solar factory in California, that it becomes clearer that we can -- if we are going to be less dependent on foreign oil, then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be more dependent on domestic oil.\xc2\xa0 In order to not be -- not simply take the dependence of one and move it to a proximity closer, we have to invest heavily in a clean energy economy, largely what was done through the Recovery Act, but creating a marketplace for that to continue is tremendously important.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it -- I think it adds to the urgency of getting something done on energy.\xc2\xa0 And I would say this, Peter -- one of the things we have learned throughout our time here is you do not get to pick what events you deal with.\xc2\xa0 And the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have that luxury -- including rain yesterday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask on a different topic then?\xc2\xa0 On Friday, after our last chance with you last week, we received this memo from Bob Bauer on the Sestak matter.\xc2\xa0 In three months -- this is the response after three months of questions.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not a big deal, as you guys are saying, then why did we wait for three months to answer that question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask Counsel for a better answer on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you have something to do with that as the chief spokesman for the White House?\xc2\xa0 You were asked on a number of occasions and don\xe2\x80\x99t you think that that kind of created --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If I bear some responsibility for that, I can understand that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When President Obama spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu, did he just suggest the time has come to either change or alter the embargo --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer to that off the top of my head.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And was the United States blind-sided by this incident?\xc2\xa0 Certainly a lot of other countries including Turkey knew that this flotilla was headed --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the question that I took earlier, just to be clear, was, did we have knowledge of the military operation.\xc2\xa0 And the answer to that was no.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, this is not the first flotilla that has happened.\xc2\xa0 So, again, my answer previously was based on previous knowledge of the military operation, which the President did not have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when do you think Prime Minister Netanyahu might come back?\xc2\xa0 And what -- and how about President Abbas\xe2\x80\x99 visit next week?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s on schedule I think the 9th of June, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to cancel that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.\xc2\xa0 That schedule is moving forward.\xc2\xa0 For the Israeli answer, obviously, he\xe2\x80\x99s got an open invitation.\xc2\xa0 But I would direct the scheduling -- the particulars of that schedule to their government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Egypt has apparently opened the -- one of the entrances to Gaza now in response to this to allow more traffic in and out.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States think that\'s a good idea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with NSC.\xc2\xa0 Again, I understand that we have -- we do have concerns about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The aid ship the Rachel Corrie is scheduled to arrive in Gazan waters tomorrow.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The aid ship the Rachel Corrie is scheduled to arrive in Gazan waters tomorrow and the Israelis are planning to intercept it.\xc2\xa0 Would you consider calling on them not to do that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me get some information on the extent of that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you get back to us on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I will find that answer out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, there is a big delegation from India in town for a U.S.-India strategic dialogue to be held at the State Department starting tomorrow with Secretary Hillary Clinton and India\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Minister Krishna.\xc2\xa0 And I understand President Obama will be the guest of -- guest at the reception on Thursday at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Do you think the President will have a special message for this U.S.-India relations?\xc2\xa0 And also, if U.S. is supporting India\xe2\x80\x99s entry in the United Nations Secretary Council?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me get -- I don\'t know what the remarks are for Thursday, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a look at that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as this oil spill is concerned, I understand State Department said that there\xe2\x80\x99s many nations who has offered help in this connection.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too long, and I understand President is frustrated and Americans are frustrated, but you think there is no technology who can help?\xc2\xa0 So many scientists are there and are you seeking really international outside help?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think as Admiral Allen said today and has said in the past, we have -- several countries have offered, and we have taken their help -- some on boom, some on additional skimmers -- and so obviously throughout this process, if there are those that can aid in the disaster in the Gulf, we have accepted.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I may, as far as presidential trip to Indonesia is concerned, do you think President feels that now there is a need for another clear-cut message which he had in Cairo and in Turkey for the Muslim world now in the largest Muslim country, in Indonesia?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, let me -- I don\'t want to get too far ahead on the foreign trip.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to talk about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Does the United States have\xc2\xa0 support for additional sanctions against North Korea?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Do we support additional sanctions?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Obviously South Korea and others have taken the concern about them, the investigation that was conducted, to the United Nations for further actions.\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously in close communication with the South Koreans and are supportive of their efforts to respond.</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Robert, can I just ask one two-part question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If your name is Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you come back to me?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that Israel is becoming a burden politically to the United States --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, what was the question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that Israel is becoming a political burden to the United States?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Based on?\xc2\xa0 Based on?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear here.\xc2\xa0 The United States and Israel -- as I have said on countless occasions, we have a trusted relationship.\xc2\xa0 They are an important ally and we are greatly supportive of their security.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not going to change.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 security?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick follow.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that Mr. Netanyahu is in control of his government?\xc2\xa0 And finally, what does this situation --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s not for me to talk about, Margaret.\xc2\xa0 I\'m happy to try to convey information but I don\'t have an answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, what does the situation do to U.S. relations with Turkey, specifically?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President spoke with Prime Minister Erdogan seven to 10 days ago.\xc2\xa0 They had a good conversation about things like Iran.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that in the coming days the President and Prime Minister will talk again.\xc2\xa0 Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re an important friend in all this and a relationship that we value greatly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have not spoken in the wake of this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They have not spoken, no.\xc2\xa0 I know that they have not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Just a couple of quick things on the Sestak thing again.\xc2\xa0 The counsel\xe2\x80\x99s memo on Friday said that efforts were made in June and July of 2009.\xc2\xa0 Were there multiple efforts and were all those made by President Clinton?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Whatever is in the memo is accurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but, I mean, with regards to June and July, I mean, were all those President Clinton or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the relationship on how that happened, yes, is explained in the memo.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Joe Sestak said he had one conversation with President Clinton.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one more.\xc2\xa0 As far as -- it said this is an unpaid position.\xc2\xa0 Does that make a difference in the view of the White House, that it would be an unpaid position as opposed to a paid position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into hypotheticals.\xc2\xa0 The situation was an unpaid position and didn\xe2\x80\x99t constitute a lot of what you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and just one more -- sorry.\xc2\xa0 But the Intelligence Advisory Board, which most reports said this offer was for, that would be a position a member of the House could not serve on.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how I understand the way the PIAB is written.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the memo, it said that this would be a position to serve in the House and serve on a presidential advisory board.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how could he sit on the board?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, how would that work?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why was your offer --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the offer, then?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What position, what board, was it then?\xc2\xa0 Do you know?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the memo.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the memo didn\xe2\x80\x99t specify.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Carol Browner said that BP had a financial interest in keeping the numbers on the flow rates low so that they would avoid fines.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that raises the possibility of any sort of fraud or criminal misstatement?\xc2\xa0 And BP\xe2\x80\x99s stock --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On BP\xe2\x80\x99s part?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the part of BP.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, let me, before I -- again, there were estimates that they made, there were estimates that NOAA made, again based on surface photography, that we had always felt was important to get a better understanding of, when we got a better look at what was happening 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean.\xc2\xa0 So we stood up the flow rate group in order to get a better accounting and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look at as we make cuts --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she made this connection between them saving some money and --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because, again, as she said and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, the penalty that will be given to BP is based off not only on the environmental record, but based -- or can change based on the environmental record, but is also impacted by the amount of ultimate pollution entered into, in this case, the Gulf.</p>\n<p>So as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, they have -- while they may have a financial incentive to have a lower number, the estimates that we made were based on a group -- a team of scientists that had been peer-reviewed by other scientists in order to come up with as accurate a gauge as we can.\xc2\xa0 Understanding\xc2\xa0 -- and this is not to minimize, but we are -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something that\xe2\x80\x99s happening 5,000 below.\xc2\xa0 It is not something that you can see and touch except using a remotely operated vehicle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the other thing is BP\xe2\x80\x99s stock price took a big hit today and there\xe2\x80\x99s been some speculation that if this thing turns out to be as big as folks think, this could really hurt the company, perhaps, some folks have speculated, that it might have to be broken up.\xc2\xa0 Would it concern the administration that the price would become so onerous to BP that they would either go bankrupt or be broken up?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that expressed because I believe you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a company with the type of market capitalization that can -- and will -- fully pay for the damage caused on the disaster that they\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Some Senate Democrats have said that they were told by the White House that the President would be making recess appointments.\xc2\xa0 Will there be any appointments this week?\xc2\xa0 And are you just talking about a handful or --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- I have not gotten any guidance on that, George, thus far, but let me take a look into that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Robert --</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with Lester and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.\xc2\xa0 A two-part question relating to yesterday, Memorial Day.\xc2\xa0 As a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School, the President has never protested --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t graduate from Harvard, Lester.\xc2\xa0 He graduated from Harvard Law School, but he graduated from Columbia undergrad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I correct that.\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much.<br/>\nThe President has never protested the memorials to Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s war dead in World War I and II, which include the names of Harvard alumni designated as \xe2\x80\x9cenemy\xe2\x80\x9d because they were soldiers of the Kaiser and of the Fuhrer.\xc2\xa0 Has he -- he\xe2\x80\x99s never protested that, has he?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, Lester, I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any knowledge.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe it is right for Harvard to have memorials mentioning these three German enemies, but no memorial at all to 71 Harvard alumni who died in the Confederate Army?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n3:12 P.M. EDT</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
