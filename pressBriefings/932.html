Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:55 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for coming to the White House for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 I want to welcome -- we have a group of Haitian journalists here visiting.\xc2\xa0 I want to welcome you to the White House briefing room.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI have a couple of things I\xe2\x80\x99d like to read out to you before I take questions.\xc2\xa0 First, I wanted to mention that thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollars on health care and not overhead, executive bonuses and advertising.\xc2\xa0 If insurance companies fail to meet that standard, as you know, they must provide a rebate to their consumers.\xc2\xa0 Provision of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a new report, which found that thanks to the President\xe2\x80\x99s health care law, 15.8 million Americans will receive $1.3 billion in rebates -- an average rebate of $127 per enrollee in the individual market.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s news is yet another sign of how the Affordable Care Act is already strengthening the health care system for millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn a second matter, I just wanted to let you know that as part of his regular briefings on homeland security and counterterrorism, the President met today with members of his national security team to review the threat picture as we head into the anniversary of the bin Laden takedown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt this time, we have no credible information that terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda, are plotting attacks in the U.S. to coincide with the anniversary of bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xc2\xa0 However, we asses that AQ\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates and allies remain intent on conducting attacks in the homeland, possibly to avenge the death of bin Laden, but not necessarily tied to the anniversary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President thanked his team and directed them to continue taking all necessary measures to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Couple questions.\xc2\xa0 First, on the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re now investigating another alleged incident involving agents and prostitutes.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one in El Salvador during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 I know you defer questions about investigations to them, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President directly has ever been assured by Director Sullivan that what happened in Colombia was isolated.\xc2\xa0 Or has there been an understanding here that there might have been other incidents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President was briefed by Director Sullivan.\xc2\xa0 I do not have a point-by-point readout for you of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 He was briefed on the investigation specifically into the incident in Colombia.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat investigation is continuing.\xc2\xa0 Although, as you know, action has been taken with regard to a number of individuals.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I would refer to you, as it relates to the reports that you just mentioned, to the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 I simply don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President in any way directed the Pentagon in its investigation to be completely forthcoming?\xc2\xa0 I ask because Senator McCain said today that the Secret Service seems to be forthcoming in its review.\xc2\xa0 But as it relates to the military members, he said the Pentagon has completely stonewalled.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to the Defense Department.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of the reports of what Senator McCain said, but I obviously am not familiar with the briefing they received.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President\xe2\x80\x99s position, as he explained it when he was taking questions in Colombia, is that he believes that every American who travels abroad, representing the United States, should behave himself or herself in accordance with the highest standards of probity and dignity.\xc2\xa0 And I think that applies to representatives from all different branches of the government and agencies within the administration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 One other question on the student loans.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how this issue shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t partisan, but it is.\xc2\xa0 Boehner said -- Speaker Boehner said the President has turned this into a political one, not just by pushing for his idea but by traveling, going to campuses.\xc2\xa0 And one of his quotes was -- today from Speaker Boehner was, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the biggest job in the world, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a President make it so small.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any reaction to that, and whether, more broadly, you think we\xe2\x80\x99re sort of in another one of these low points in this town.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I understand that Speaker Boehner and Republicans on Capitol Hill are busy backing and filling, trying to explain how they can support -- how they now support fixing the student loan interest rate problem, when they all voted in favor of a Republican budget, the Ryan budget -- their governing document -- which explicitly took another course of action and would have allowed interest rate loans on -- Stafford loans to double.\xc2\xa0 So they can\xe2\x80\x99t have it both ways.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are absolutely pleased that -- because the President has raised this issue, because he\xe2\x80\x99s taken it out to the country, because he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to students and others across the country about the need to ensure that these interest rates don\xe2\x80\x99t double, Republicans are now saying that they agree.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s good.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that there is some suggestion that, well, even though they voted for the Republican budget that made it a fact, if had become -- if it were to become law, that these student interest loan rates would -- student loan rates would double, they were going to fix it; that was always their plan.\xc2\xa0 They just didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone.\xc2\xa0 It was a secret.\xc2\xa0 And maybe they were just going to announce that -- spring it on the American people sometime late in June.\xc2\xa0 Well, I know none of you believe that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd in fact, there was a vote in a committee on this issue, during the deliberations over the Republican budget, where a Democrat on the committee offered an amendment that would have fixed this problem, ensured that the lower interest rates continued beyond July 1st.\xc2\xa0 Republicans voted unanimously against that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we know what their position was.\xc2\xa0 We are glad they changed it.\xc2\xa0 And they changed it, in large part, because the President took his argument out to the country and they felt that pressure.\xc2\xa0 The American people understand -- and in a way, I guess the Speaker doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that education is an essential element of the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Making sure that our kids get a quality education is elemental not just to their individual future, but to the future of the American economy.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is out there pushing this issue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he is happy to see Republicans now -- a little Johnny-come-lately -- supporting the position that he\'s taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to follow in the same vein.\xc2\xa0 One of the other things that Speaker Boehner said today was depicting this dispute over student loans as a fake fight, as something that the President amplified by going out into the country to speak about it.\xc2\xa0 But you\'ve just said that you think by going out into the country, that that actually caused the change that was -- that you were wanting.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if you could discuss -- is there not also a thought of engaging directly with Congress, having meetings here, having the President go to Capitol Hill instead of to North Carolina or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ve seen -- and we saw it in the payroll tax cut issue debate that resulted in Republicans ultimately doing the right thing and making sure that millions of Americans didn\'t have -- hardworking Americans didn\'t have their taxes go up this year -- that when the American public is behind an idea, that Congress respond, at least on some occasions.\xc2\xa0 And that hopefully is the case here.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\'re not there yet.\xc2\xa0 There\'s obviously an effort to continue to politicize this, to try to refight old ideological battles and -- rather than just acknowledging that this is the right thing to do and working together to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I want to go back to the fact that -- the suggestion that this is a manufactured battle is belied by the overwhelming support that Republicans have evinced for the Ryan/Republican budget, which uses the money that would be gained by doubling these interest rates as part of their -- as part of how they provide tax cuts to the wealthy and reduce spending overall.\xc2\xa0 So either -- you can\'t have it both ways.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t say America has got the equivalent of the stage 3 cancer of socialism because the federal government is tampering in all kinds of stuff it has no business tampering in -- Congressman, Republican, from Missouri, referring to this policy and the President\'s position on the need for Congress to take action to ensure these rates stay low -- and then say you were for it all along.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just not credible.</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move around.\xc2\xa0 Jessica.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The committee vote you\'re referring to, just to be clear, allowed a pay-for that would have -- the Democrats\' proposal would have paid for this through closing corporate loopholes on jets, oil subsidies to oil companies.\xc2\xa0 So when you talk about fighting old ideological fights, it seems the real battle here is over how to pay for this.\xc2\xa0 Republicans object to the Democrats\' proposal.\xc2\xa0 Why is the White House objecting to the Republicans\' proposal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s be clear:\xc2\xa0 The real fight here -- there is a negotiation that should and hopefully will take place to decide how to pay for this in a constructive way that everyone can agree on.\xc2\xa0 But your assessment -- the premise of your question would be true if Republicans heretofore had proposed -- if there was any evidence of any initiative by Republicans to lower these interest -- keep these interest rates low.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'ve said that they can plan to negotiate on this and --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They said that after the President made an issue of it.\xc2\xa0 It is not in the Ryan/Republican budget.\xc2\xa0 There was a committee vote where they rejected an effort to ensure that these interest rates stayed low.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also not in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget after next year.\xc2\xa0 So he only extends it for --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, he did it for a year, and obviously we would assess it again in a year.\xc2\xa0 It is absent from the governing document of the Republican Party that every Republican in the House voted for, that every leader in the Republican Party supports.\xc2\xa0 So you can\'t then say you were always for it.</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, on the pay-fors, we support the Senate Democratic proposal as one alternative.\xc2\xa0 There are other options to pay<br/>\n\tfor it; many of them are available in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 We are willing to negotiate this.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- the thing I read at the top of this briefing about the billions of dollars of savings the American people have already received because of one provision in the Affordable Care Act, and yet Republicans want to somehow -- because they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost this battle over the need to ensure that students don\xe2\x80\x99t have their interest rates double -- want to kind of messy the water -- stir up the waters here by making this about health care, having a pay-for pulled out of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this before.\xc2\xa0 We watched this movie during the payroll tax cut debate.\xc2\xa0 It didn\xe2\x80\x99t end well for them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because the American people overwhelmingly support this action.\xc2\xa0 They overwhelmingly support the pay-fors that we propose.\xc2\xa0 And they need to just -- if they want to fight about -- look, we know what the Republican position is on the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 They want to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 They have no alternative, but they want to --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is a lot less money than the payroll tax cut debate.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But hold on, they want to repeal it.\xc2\xa0 We understand that.\xc2\xa0 They will argue that in this campaign.\xc2\xa0 They will argue that insurance companies will once again be able to dictate to consumers the rules of the road in terms of their insurance, their health care coverage.\xc2\xa0 They will argue that the benefits that I just talked about at the top of this briefing should not be given to the American people, and that is fine.\xc2\xa0 And let the election decide that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s solve the student loan rate problem now and focus on pay-fors that are reasonable and acceptable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said that the Republicans certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let student loan rates double overnight if they really cared about this issue.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe Republicans really don\xe2\x80\x99t care about this issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we saw the other day in a statement by the spokesman of the House Republicans -- the House Speaker, the Republican leader in the House, when he suggested that the President was talking about this issue to avoid talking about the economy, to avoid his economic record.\xc2\xa0 And I think it unintentionally revealed a perspective about what the economy is that stands in stark contrast to what the President\xe2\x80\x99s perspective is.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEducation is essential to our economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s essential to our future economic growth.\xc2\xa0 The economy is not just the tax rates that the wealthiest individuals, hedge fund managers, law firm partners and big corporations pay.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s average folks out there who are trying hard to make a living, people who are trying to get an education so they can start a business, or be a teacher or be an engineer.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a perfect inadvertent declaration of the difference, I think, in perspective that we have about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, yes, education is essential.\xc2\xa0 Ensuring that these kids don\xe2\x80\x99t have their interest rates doubled on their loans is essential, and the President is going to keep pushing it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo many hands.\xc2\xa0 Amy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to the allegations -- a lot of Republicans are saying that you guys are flying all over the country on taxpayer dollars.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will respond to that with alacrity.\xc2\xa0 I will note a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 One, as all of the questions so far in this briefing prove, we are talking about a policy issue that needs to be acted on by Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President supports, and Congress needs to act on it.\xc2\xa0 Because of the efforts by the President to go out in the country to talk about this, to raise awareness about this looming deadline and the potential for payments that students have to make to go up, this has gotten a lot of attention.\xc2\xa0 And Congress, hopefully, will act because of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think it is eminently obvious that the President was out talking about a policy issue.\xc2\xa0 This is official business.\xc2\xa0 And he did it effectively.\xc2\xa0 It is also, to me, ironic that the arguments about this are coming from people who know that we assiduously follow all the rules in terms of the delineations between campaign travel and official travel, just as our predecessor did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would note that the Speaker of the House, one such critic, praised a trip by President Bush to Ohio in 2004, to talk about education, as absolutely the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 So I understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s an effort to politicize this, an effort to hide the fact that they have a policy problem on their hands.\xc2\xa0 But our interest, the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest, is ensuring that this matter be taken care of on behalf of American college students.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir, in the red tie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to clarify this, when Speaker Boehner says that the President is campaigning on this issue and when he says that the President should pay back the Treasury on this issue, what\xe2\x80\x99s the response from the President\xe2\x80\x99s team or from the White House?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, my response is what I just gave.\xc2\xa0 We follow these rules by the book.\xc2\xa0 We -- just the same rules that -- although there have been some changes that have been written about that you could argue aren\xe2\x80\x99t even advantageous to us, but the -- we follow the rules.\xc2\xa0 And it was the same rules that were in place when President George W. Bush was in office and running for reelection in 2004, the same rules that were in place when President Clinton was running for reelection in 1996.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is a simple fact -- as Republicans have acknowledged when there\xe2\x80\x99s been a Republican President in office -- that when you are President, you are President 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\xc2\xa0 You do not leave the office behind.\xc2\xa0 And when you take -- when you make campaign travel, which this President has and will, you have to obviously travel on Air Force One, and you have security and communications requirements that come with the office, and staffing requirements that come with the office.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t -- that\xe2\x80\x99s an essential, elemental part of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut all the rules that we follow are the ones that our predecessors followed.\xc2\xa0 And going back to this trip, I think as this discussion shows very clearly, the President was arguing on behalf of a policy that he believes is essential.\xc2\xa0 He was calling on Congress, and will continue to call on Congress to act, to fix a problem that if not fixed will negatively affect millions of students across the country.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that as part of his job.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of his job.</p>\n<p>\n\tJake.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Ben\xe2\x80\x99s question about the alleged incident with Secret Service agents in El Salvador, was the President aware that there were allegations like this before the news report this morning?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I doubt it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that any of us were aware of it until we read newspaper reports.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess my question is, if we\xe2\x80\x99re learning about this from the media, this alleged incident, is it not possible that the Secret Service is not actually doing a thorough investigation of previous incidents as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Secret Service for questions about their investigation.\xc2\xa0 We have said that when that investigation is complete, they may have things to say about questions regarding overall culture or issues with the Service, if there are any, that extend beyond this particular incident in Colombia.\xc2\xa0 But certainly for the time being, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment on unconfirmed reports that appear in the newspaper about potential other incidents.\xc2\xa0 I think the Secret Service is handling this and that\xe2\x80\x99s where you should direct your questions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are they?\xc2\xa0 Are they looking into other possible reports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you should ask them what direct questions --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we have.\xc2\xa0 And the first statement the Secret Service gave this morning was something along the lines of unconfirmed reports, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look into anything credible.\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the question is, is it up to the media to investigate what the Secret Service might have done, or is the Secret Service taking the lead on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would refer you to what the Secret Service said.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, just one other issue.\xc2\xa0 Could you comment at all on the Department of Labor rule requiring 90 hours of training for safety, for children that might be working on farms?\xc2\xa0 This has offended some people in rural communities.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, why did the administration feel like this rule was necessary?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the reasoning behind it?\xc2\xa0 And how much were rural communities consulted before it was issued?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is the President going to be assured that this is not a pattern of behavior by the Secret Service?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Norah, I will answer your question as I have others, which is the Secret Service is still engaged in an investigation.\xc2\xa0 The issues that may or may not emanate beyond the specifics of this case I think are ones that you should, if you have questions about it, should address to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile this is an ongoing investigation, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment more broadly.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not going to comment upon rumors or speculation that appears in the media about either this incident or other potential incidents.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President like to make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a pattern of behavior?<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President made clear that he believes that those of us who work for the U.S. government, whether at the White House or in an agency of the administration, or for Congress or in the military, when we travel abroad on official trips we are representing the people of this country and we should do so by conducting ourselves in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, was asked about it today, whether this was a pattern of behavior and what should be done, his response was hire more women.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that\xe2\x80\x99s the answer?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this goes to a broader question about the nature of the agency, culture of the agency.\xc2\xa0 I think for now, anyway, those questions are best addressed to the agency itself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, finally, Secretary Napolitano on the Hill yesterday said that over the past two and half years, the Secret Service Office of Professional Responsibility has not received any such complaint of wrongdoing.\xc2\xa0 Is that sufficient, having not received a complaint that there\xe2\x80\x99s no wrongdoing at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just refer you to Secretary Napolitano, obviously whose department oversees this agency.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a bit of a preview tomorrow, travel to Fort Stewart, Georgia?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the message?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, where are we going?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fort Stewart, Georgia.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Georgia?\xc2\xa0 How come you guys aren\xe2\x80\x99t asking, why are we going to Georgia?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many times --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a battleground, that\xe2\x80\x99s why.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s in play.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Trying to go to blue states?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned yesterday on Air Force One, in response to a question about this, that the subject matter of the trip, which is an official trip, is the President and First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to our veterans and military families.\xc2\xa0 It will be related to that.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more specifics for you on the trip later today in a call that you can join.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about the status agreement talks between the U.S. and Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I just gave you a little bit of preview of the subject matter, which seems a little different from what you just asked.\xc2\xa0 But for more details, I urge you to call in.\xc2\xa0 I will give you information for that call a little later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that for a second?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the briefing he got today about OBL anniversary.\xc2\xa0 Biden mentioned it today at NYU.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do anything on Tuesday --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any advanced scheduling announcements for you, for next week.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about next week for you tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be talking about it tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information about tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 I did, perhaps a little prematurely, show a little ankle on the subject matter yesterday.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m confirming what I said yesterday that it will be related to veterans and military family issues.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more information for you later.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on that same thing, is there any discomfort at the White House about politicizing the decisions and everything else that surrounded the takedown of bin Laden?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your question -- I think you need to ask a more specific question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in Biden\xe2\x80\x99s -- it was a highlight of the Biden speech today.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, to what extent is this going to become a political issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said it was the bumper sticker for your campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that foreign policy will obviously be discussed in the campaign.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the campaign for more on the Vice President\'s speech, which was a campaign speech.\xc2\xa0 But I think that we have, and the President has, discussed the mission that resulted in bin Laden\'s death and the extraordinary work of our military and intelligence services in bringing it about.\xc2\xa0 And the -- in terms that I think are very sober and reflect the reality of the fact that al Qaeda was and is our number-one enemy; that al Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, launched attacks against this country that took thousands of lives.\xc2\xa0 And that fight continues to this day.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it\'s a part of his foreign policy record, obviously.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s also part of a very serious endeavor to keep our country safe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you strike a balance between all of what you just said and taking it out on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the way that we\'ve handled it is -- represents exactly the balance you need to strike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow on him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll go to Ed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, an EPA official has apologized now for what he says was a poor choice of words when he said in 2010 his philosophy on oil and gas enforcement was to be like the Romans and find the first five guys and crucify them.\xc2\xa0 Now, the person has apologized, as I said.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any concerns that this tape was doctored in any way?\xc2\xa0 Have you done any investigation to see whether it\'s accurate?\xc2\xa0 There have been other cases where tapes like this have been selectively edited.\xc2\xa0 I just want to be clear up front, do you challenge the accuracy of this at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard suggested that there is an issue with that.\xc2\xa0 I think that you noted correctly that the individual here apologized and made clear that those comments are an inaccurate way to characterize the work EPA does.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, he\'s right -- they are entirely inaccurate as a characterization of the work that EPA does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI would notice that just -- note that just recently there was a rule put out by EPA, affecting natural gas, that was supported by both industry and environmentalists, demonstrating the kind of approach that we take on matters like this.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that since the President took office, oil and gas production has increased each year.\xc2\xa0 Oil is currently at an eight-year high, and domestic natural gas production is higher than at any time in history.\xc2\xa0 On federal lands and waters alone, oil production is up 13 percent since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 And in 2010, for the first time in 13 years, imported oil accounted for less than 50 percent of the oil consumed in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo our -- the President\'s approach, his all-of-the-above approach to our energy needs, I think, documents and proves that those comments do not reflect his policy or the approach that the EPA has taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republican Senator Inhofe, who has been a long-time critic of the EPA -- many, many years -- says, however, that there have been actions taken by the EPA in states like Pennsylvania, where they\'ve accused natural gas companies of contaminating water.\xc2\xa0 He and other Republicans think it\'s been trumped up.\xc2\xa0 Does this not call into question some of those actions when you now have this tape of an official letting his hair down and saying, let\'s crucify them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the official\'s comments not only are inaccurate as a representation of -- or characterization of the way that the EPA has operated under President Obama, they are provably inaccurate by our record on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I just mentioned, oil production is up 13 percent on federal water -- federal lands and waters.\xc2\xa0 Oil is currently at an eight-year high of production here.\xc2\xa0 And domestic natural gas production -- the issue that you\'re talking about -- is at an all-time high.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo clearly, there is not an effort of the nature that you talk about.\xc2\xa0 Quite the contrary, there is a commitment to ensure that natural gas is an essential part of our energy future, and the President believes very strongly that we can exploit that resource in a safe and responsible way.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So last thing -- if that is your policy, and if the President\'s approach -- going back to the \'08 campaign -- was about hope and change and setting a new tone -- of setting a new tone -- somebody saying we should crucify the industry, why is that person still working at the EPA as a political appointee of the President?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to fire him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\'s apologized and he\'s -- what he said is clearly not representative of either this President\'s belief in the way that we should approach these matters or in the way that he has approached these matters, either from this office here in the White House or at the EPA.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Kristen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what was the President\'s reaction when he heard about the allegations out of El Salvador?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken to him about them.\xc2\xa0 Again, you\'re talking about a rumor in a newspaper that, as far as I know, is not confirmed, and I would just refer you to the Secret Service.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a rumor.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, it was an investigation by -- there was a source and then --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Secret Service has said that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And reporters never -- like investigations, they never get it wrong.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At least somebody is investigating it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, fair enough.\xc2\xa0 But I haven\'t talked to him about it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a reaction for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano\'s comments yesterday, she also said that not everybody else was doing it, and that, second, this behavior is not a part of the Secret Service way of doing business.\xc2\xa0 To be fair, she also said the investigation is continuing.\xc2\xa0 But is there any concern that some of those comments may have been premature?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President has said, and said as recently as two nights ago, that he believes very strongly that the vast majority of the men and women who work for the Secret Service conduct themselves in an entirely professional manner, and they conduct themselves that way as they carry out a responsibility that is dangerous and difficult and essential to our democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis does not excuse any occasion where those standards have not been met.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes, and I think Secretary Napolitano reflected this in her remarks, that the vast majority of those men and women who work for the Secret Service are absolute professionals committed to their mission, and that their work is very important.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shifting topics, Jay -- Senator Marco Rubio has proposed his own DREAM Act of sorts, which the administration, I believe, feels doesn\'t go far enough to create a path to citizenship for some children of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 Has the President reviewed this plan --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s actually not a quite accurate representation of his loose proposal, which is not in legislative form.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the path to citizenship --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President reviewed this plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Has the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- reviewed this plan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Have you?\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think it\'s ever been presented, to my knowledge.\xc2\xa0 But the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let\'s just -- well, let\'s go back to what we\'re talking about here.\xc2\xa0 The President has repeatedly made clear that he is a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform in order to restore accountability and responsibility to a badly broken immigration system, which is something that\'s vitally important to building an economy that has the foundation for -- necessary so that America can compete and win in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 And that position includes his very strong support for the DREAM Act.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s important to remember that the only reason the DREAM Act is not law right now, the only reason that immigration -- comprehensive immigration reform is not law right now is because Republicans have consistently demagogued the issue and blocked action in Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, if Republicans are ready to recognize that we can work together on this issue, and if they want to start with the DREAM Act and give young people who have been raised as Americans a path to citizenship so they can serve in our military, put their talent to work in our schools, work in our labs and start businesses, then we should do that.\xc2\xa0 And let\'s give them a rigorous and thorough process to get right with the law, but one that provides a pathway to citizenship.\xc2\xa0 And I think this is an issue here.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s what makes sense.\xc2\xa0 And the President is ready to sign into law such a bill tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We need to do this in a bipartisan way -- that\'s been proven.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we had a situation where, with comprehensive immigration reform, one of the major proponents of it abandoned his support for it on the Republican side.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is willing to work with any member of Congress who is willing to work constructively on this issue, and he\'s going to continue to fight for this much needed reform.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, General Gantz of Israel was quoted on an interview yesterday saying that he does not think Iran was going to build a nuclear bomb.\xc2\xa0 What does that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Saying what, I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does not believe Iran is going to build a nuclear bomb, seemingly taking a position less strident, perhaps, than Prime Minister Netanyahu\'s assessment of the situation.\xc2\xa0 How does the White House look at this?\xc2\xa0 Does that change or affect in any way how you all view that issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, it doesn\'t.\xc2\xa0 We are firmly committed, Peter, to preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is the focal point of our policy.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the President came into office, the world was divided about this issue and about the appropriate approach to it.\xc2\xa0 Because of the policy approach the President has taken, the world is now united at making -- in making clear that it is Iranian behavior that is the issue; it is Iran\xe2\x80\x99s failure to demonstrate to the international community that it does not seek a nuclear weapon that is the issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what the P5-plus-1 talks represent, essentially, is an avenue for Iran to change that equation by demonstrating that, in a verifiable way, that they will forsake their nuclear weapons ambitions.\xc2\xa0 And if they do that, there is a path open to Iran to rejoining the international community of nations, ending their severe isolation and ending the punishing sanctions that have been imposed upon them because of their bad behavior.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the United States share General Gantz\xe2\x80\x99s view that, in fact, Iran is not likely to build a nuclear bomb?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed various assessments by this administration or this U.S. government on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s programs and intentions.\xc2\xa0 We have said that they are some time away from having the capacity to build a weapon.\xc2\xa0 But we are very clear-eyed about Iranian intentions, and that is why we insist on verifiable action as opposed to promises in rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another topic, real quickly -- the Judicial Watch says it\xe2\x80\x99s received documents from you all, from the administration, the government, showing that Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Spain in 2010 cost the taxpayers $467,000.\xc2\xa0 Do you all have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 I think we addressed this issue a long time ago, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have a comment on it, but thanks.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you were asked about this two days ago on Air Force One -- you said you\xe2\x80\x99d look into it.\xc2\xa0 But when the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hope I did.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I sometimes forget.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President -- or if the President was briefed on the Bo Xilai scandal that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on in China?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think -- I want to make clear a couple of things about this.\xc2\xa0 One is, this is obviously something that\xe2\x80\x99s in the press, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he is aware of it through that.\xc2\xa0 He gets briefed regularly on both things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t in the press as well as things that are, that are matters of concern or just matters that are out there on the national security horizon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an issue within China.\xc2\xa0 And I think the State Department is a good place to ask questions about this.\xc2\xa0 This is not a White House matter, particularly.\xc2\xa0 So when you asked me, when was he briefed on it, I mean, I think he -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he was.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in the habit of ticking off the subject items in every intelligence or presidential daily briefing he gets.\xc2\xa0 But this is not an item that requires presidential action or attention.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a leadership issue in China.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re a huge economic power.\xc2\xa0 I mean --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But -- so if you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me if he\xe2\x80\x99s aware of it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he is.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been briefed on it?\xc2\xa0 I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 But again, this is not a policy matter for the United States or -- it is obviously a story that if you read the newspapers you\xe2\x80\x99re following, but beyond that I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have really a comment on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then yesterday, Chairman Bernanke said that the Fed would not be able to I guess offset the fiscal cliff that would happen at the end of the year if the Bush tax cuts weren\xe2\x80\x99t renewed and the payroll tax cut weren\xe2\x80\x99t renewed.\xc2\xa0 And I wonder if that complicates the President\xe2\x80\x99s effort to try and make sure that those -- that the Bush tax cuts themselves aren\xe2\x80\x99t extended.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how I understood his comments.\xc2\xa0 But what I think -- I think what his assessment and the assessments of others, including the President, make clear is that we need to take concerted, bipartisan action to address our deficit and debt challenges.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 We need to do it in a way that bipartisan commissions that have addressed this problem have all said is essential.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou have to look -- I mean, this is not -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been enough attention and enough study of this issue of late, that I think everyone understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually not that complicated in the broadest sense.\xc2\xa0 You need to reduce nondefense discretionary spending pretty significantly, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that.\xc2\xa0 Lowest levels of nondefense discretionary spending since Dwight Eisenhower was President, before most people in this room were born, okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tSecond, you need to deal with, in a responsible way, reductions in defense spending.\xc2\xa0 The President has proposed that.\xc2\xa0 You need to deal with reform of entitlement programs in a way that ensures that the essential benefits and guarantees represented by Medicare and Social Security remain available to future generations of Americans, but that reform those programs so that they retain their solvency going forward.\xc2\xa0 The President has proposed that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd you need to -- as a matter of essential balance, so that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to gut everything else -- you need to increase revenues.\xc2\xa0 You need to look at tax expenditures.\xc2\xa0 And the President has proposed exactly that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one missing element in all of this has been -- in embracing that comprehensive, balanced approach -- has been Republicans, by and large, and elected Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Republicans out in the country support it.\xc2\xa0 Republicans who used to be elected but are retired now support it.\xc2\xa0 Republican statesmen support it.\xc2\xa0 But members of the House in particular, but also the Senate, don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is severely at odds with American public opinion and it\xe2\x80\x99s severely at odds with common-sense policy.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s our position.</p>\n<p>\n\tWow.\xc2\xa0 Voice of America, more foreign policy, please.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, always enlightening.\xc2\xa0 To go back to your statement about the assessment of continuing intent by al Qaeda affiliates -- I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about Yemen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an escalating conflict there between government troops and al Qaeda forces.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of deaths and wounded there.\xc2\xa0 The FBI director was there the other day.\xc2\xa0 What should Americans think about that situation at this point?\xc2\xa0 Should they think it\xe2\x80\x99s improving, in terms of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we remain very focused on supporting a peaceful transition, political transition in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to stand by the Yemeni people as they take steps to realize a more secure, prosperous, and democratic future.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously a very important place, and we have made that clear with regards to our national security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur approach to Yemen is comprehensive.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue, as the transition progresses, to meet the needs of the Yemeni people by delivering humanitarian and economic aid, as well as providing security and counterterrorism support, to combat the common threat of violent extremism.\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, which I think you made reference to, al Qaeda, despite the successes that we have achieved in the fight against it, remains a threat to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd AQAP is in particular a threat, as we see it.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have the relationship that we have with Yemen in terms of our joint efforts to fight the threat of violent extremism, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the drone strikes helping --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you know I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on counterterrorism authorities or intelligence matters, but we do obviously cooperate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Foreign policy --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jon-Christopher.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 According to satellite imagery being collected here in the U.S., there is unambiguous evidence that the Sudanese military are once again bombing unarmed South Sudan folks, civilians there.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I actually addressed this the other day, but -- and my answer is the same today as it was then, which is that we strongly condemn that violence, assaults on the South Sudanese, and we call on all sides to refrain from taking military action.\xc2\xa0 We are working very closely with our international partners on this issue and monitoring it very closely.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Yes, with the camera, sure.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A few days ago, the U.S. President made a statement on the Armenian Remembrance Day in which he avoided directly characterizing what has happened to Armenians in 1915 mass genocide -- although that was one of his promises during the election campaign that he would do so and he would describe what happened to Armenians -- mass genocide.\xc2\xa0 So your comment on this -- why these discrepancies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to the statement.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this is well known, and I think the statement was fairly comprehensive.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I quickly follow up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a U.S. President who actually did describe the event of 1915 mass genocide.\xc2\xa0 That was Ronald Reagan who did that back in 1981, in April.\xc2\xa0 He was already in this building.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder if the records -- the institutional memory of this building has kept this file that --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would just point you to the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement and the fact that his position on this issue is well known.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the way in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary of State today announced that she\xe2\x80\x99ll be traveling to India next month, early next month, along with China.\xc2\xa0 This was not in the trip initially.\xc2\xa0 Is she carrying any message from the President on the India trip?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on her trip.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all, very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:40 P.M.
