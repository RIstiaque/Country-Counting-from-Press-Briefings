EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everybody.\xc2\xa0 How\xe2\x80\x99s everybody doing?\xc2\xa0 Happy Labor Day.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously headed to Detroit this morning, where the President will speak to the Detroit Metro Labor Council at an event that is a Labor Day tradition in the great city of Detroit.\xc2\xa0 The UAW and the AFL-CIO and the Metro Labor Council help host this event. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe President, as many of you -- some of you may remember, spoke at this event in 2008, when he was a candidate for president.\xc2\xa0 I did not have the pleasure of attending that particular year\xe2\x80\x99s event, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty impressive display.\xc2\xa0 So, looking forward to going there here in a few minutes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tOn the plane with the President today is Senator Levin and Labor Secretary Hilda Solis.\xc2\xa0 Also joining us is AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, SEIU President Mary Kay Henry, and UAW President Bob King.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will they be speaking?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact lineup.\xc2\xa0 I know -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact lineup for who will be speaking today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, labor has been pretty critical of the President. Is he expecting a warm welcome today?\xc2\xa0 Is he expecting them to get on board with the reelect?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that the President will receive a warm welcome today, primarily because working men and women across the country know that they have a President who wakes up every morning in the White House thinking about policies that this government can put in place to strengthen our economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 They also know that they have a President who\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be satisfied until every working man and woman who\xe2\x80\x99s out there looking for a job -- who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a job, who wants a job, who\'s out there looking for a job, could get one.\xc2\xa0 That is the central focus of this President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda, and that is why I do anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a warm welcome.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIn terms of the campaign, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues in Chicago to answer that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent is he going to preview the Thursday speech today?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President will once again use this opportunity to challenge Democrats and Republicans to come together behind the set of principles that -- the set of policies that he will lay out on Thursday to create jobs, strengthen the economy, to support the private sector as they lead the way to a stronger economy.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of specifics, I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect him to preview any specific policy proposals in today\xe2\x80\x99s speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any new initiatives that he\xe2\x80\x99ll mention today?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not today.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything like that today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any new rhetoric?\xc2\xa0 Any new phrases?\xc2\xa0 Any new twists on anything that he\xe2\x80\x99s said previously about jobs and the economy?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do anticipate that you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear the President talk about his view, a strongly held view, that the United States economy -- or I should say it this way -- that the United States of America won\xe2\x80\x99t have a strong and growing economy until we have a strong and growing middle class.\xc2\xa0 That is a central tenet of -- I guess I should say that that\xe2\x80\x99s forefront in his mind as he\xe2\x80\x99s thinking about what kinds of policies can be put in place that Congress should pass that can further support our economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear him talk about that a little bit today as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t heard him speak yet about Friday\xe2\x80\x99s employment numbers.\xc2\xa0 Will he specifically talk about that report today?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate that he\'ll have anything specific to say about that today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the AFL-CIO president has called for the President to be "bold" in Thursday\'s speech.\xc2\xa0 Would you use that word, "bold," to describe what he will propose on Thursday?\xc2\xa0 And will he come close to the $400 billion a year in infrastructure spending that Trumka has called for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do anticipate that -- well, I should start by saying I\'ll let you describe the speech after you\'ve heard it so you can rate that for yourself.\xc2\xa0 I do anticipate that -- the President believes that it is time for the government to take serious action and that there\'s no reason that Democrats and Republicans in Congress can\'t get behind the set of proposals that he\'ll lay out to strengthen our economy and create jobs and support the private sector in that -- as they lead the way in that endeavor.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the specific proposals that he\'ll outline, I\'ll let him do that on Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nobody asked Jay this yesterday and we really haven\'t seen anybody since Friday when the jobs numbers came out -- are we in a recession?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my guess is that\'s an economic analysis for economists to point out.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, though, while economists say that the economy is growing, it\'s the President\'s view that the economy is not growing quickly enough.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why Congress needs to take immediate action on the proposals that he\'ll lay out on Thursday -- because there is more that we can do to support the private sector and strengthen the economy and stimulating job growth.\xc2\xa0 So, clearly, there\'s more that we can do to strengthen our economy, and that\'s what the President is focused on.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the trip the following day to Richmond be the start of any sort of sustained campaign to sell his vision?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I do anticipate that over the course of the fall the President will spend a decent amount of time traveling across the country, talking to men and women in communities across the country about what he believes that we need to do to get our economy going; that he believes that we need to put in place policies that have bipartisan support -- or that should earn bipartisan support -- to support the private sector\'s effort as they create jobs and strengthen the economy.\xc2\xa0 So I do anticipate that the President will spend a little bit of time this fall traveling across the country to make that case.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While we\'re in Detroit is he going to talk about autos?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He will.\xc2\xa0 As you know, when the President first took office he was faced with a very difficult policy challenge of trying to support -- lend some support to an American auto industry that was in dire straits.\xc2\xa0 But thanks to the courageous decision that this President made to support the auto industry, thanks to the men and women in that industry who have been tenacious, we are seeing -- we have seen in just the last couple of years a dramatic turnaround in that industry; that we are now in a place where we are seeing GM and Chrysler, in particular, are the two companies that got support from -- significant support from the government make a dramatic turnaround in terms of the market share that\'s increasing, in terms of the number of jobs that they\'ve created, and in terms of the advances that are made in putting out the kinds of automobiles and other vehicles that the American public and people around the world are interested in buying.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo I do anticipate that you\'ll hear the President talk about that today, because it\'s a testament, frankly, to the tenacity of the working people in the Detroit area that we are seeing a turnaround in that industry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, why did he decide to split the jobs portion of the proposals off from the deficit portion?\xc2\xa0 How quickly will the deficit side come together?\xc2\xa0 And when he does his fall trips, his series of fall trips, will jobs and deficits all be part of one discussion?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'ll let you listen to the speech to hear sort of -- to draw your own conclusions about the President\'s views on those two topics.\xc2\xa0 I can say broadly what the President will be delivering on Thursday is a jobs speech, but the President thinks that part of dealing with strengthening our economy is also addressing the midterm and long-term deficit challenges facing this country; that the President believes there\'s more that we can do.\xc2\xa0 He has some ideas for the things that the super committee can do to go beyond that $1.5 trillion deficit reduction mandate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe\'ll talk about that a little bit in the speech, but the speech will be primarily focused on jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is the policy challenge that the President is confronting with the most urgency.\xc2\xa0 But the President certainly believes that there\'s more that we can do and he has ideas for what more we can do to address our midterm and long-term challenges as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the deficit side, how soon after to expect that?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 He\'ll talk about it in the speech on Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is addressing the housing market part of addressing the jobs situation, given that it\'s one of the Achilles\' heels of the economy right now?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\'s no question that there are far too many working families who are concerned about the challenge of affording their mortgage payment every month.\xc2\xa0 So that isn\'t just a statistic that is of deep concern to this President, it\'s also something that is of deep concern on a very human level, that owning your own home is a central part of the American Dream, and that is for far too many working families a much more difficult challenge than it previously has -- than it should be, and there are far too many working families that have a rather tenuous hold on that goal. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo this is obviously a very difficult policy problem and it\'s one that the President and his advisors are working on and certainly remains an important part of dealing with the broader economic challenges that are facing the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean it will be in the speech?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to preview exactly what the President is going to get into in the speech, but I can tell you that whether it\'s in the speech or not, that it\'s something that is a high priority for this administration.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you talk about the mood in the White House these days?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the numbers in the Mid-Session Review revisions, the unemployment numbers Friday, the President\'s unemployment -- I mean, excuse me -- approval numbers -- I mean, is there a feeling at the White House like things need to turn around quickly?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a desire at the White House for things to -- for the economy to strengthen.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s no doubt that that\'s one of the reasons that people have been working so hard this summer.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\'ve heard me talk about, when we were in Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard, that there is an economic team at work at the White House working on formulating some of these policies that the President will lay out on Thursday.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo it is an urgent focus of this White House to put in place policies that will strengthen the economy.\xc2\xa0 But I think that there is -- that the President -- and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear this from him today -- that the President is optimistic about our country\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bounce back from these difficult challenges; that certainly a place like Detroit is a pretty good example.\xc2\xa0 This is a place that built probably as strong of a middle-class economy, or middle-class sector, as ever existed in the history of the world.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve faced some very difficult challenges, but they\xe2\x80\x99re on their way back. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an appropriate metaphor for the rest of the country; that we face some very difficult challenges, but if we band together, if we put our party\xe2\x80\x99s interests -- or put our country\xe2\x80\x99s interests ahead of partisan interests, that this is a challenge that we can face, that this is a challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99ll confront, and this is a challenge that we\xe2\x80\x99ll bounce back from.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear that kind of optimism from the President today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 New subject?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any comment to the comments from the ISI in Pakistan that the arrest of three al Qaeda operatives, including Younis al-Mauritani, were done thanks to cooperation -- unusual cooperation with the U.S.?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have seen those reports this morning.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position right now to confirm those reports.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that the United States continues to work with our partner, Pakistan, to achieve our central goal of dismantling, disrupting, and defeating al Qaeda; that certainly the al Qaeda elements that are in place in Pakistan are a threat to both the Pakistani people and to the American people and our allies, and that\xe2\x80\x99s an effort that we will continue to cooperate on with them moving forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you confirm later, would you let us know?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If I\'m able to get more on that today I will connect with all of you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a Syria update while we\xe2\x80\x99re all here?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No additional specific updates.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously seeing some of the continued reports about a crackdown that is apparently underway in Syria, and that is something that we continue to condemn in the strongest possible terms.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Qaddafi, any update on discussions with world leaders or on his whereabouts, on --<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have any Libya updates this morning.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with Aretha Franklin at the event?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he meet with Aretha Franklin at the event?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If he does I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In 2008, he sang a little Aretha.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, at this event -- in 2008?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Don keeps a little audio on his notebook.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNET:\xc2\xa0 Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a little reprisal today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would be nice, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President is in a pretty good mood.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the three labor leaders with him on the plane, did you say? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re here on the plane with us today.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Trumka, King and -- oh, Mary Kay Henry.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mary Kay Henry is SEIU?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UAW and SEIU -- okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR.
