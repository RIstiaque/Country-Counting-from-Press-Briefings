EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So to get it started this afternoon, Secretary Duncan is here to talk to you a little bit about the announcement that the President is going to make at Mooresville Middle School today.\xc2\xa0 I know there have been some reports on this already, but the Secretary here can talk a little bit more about the details and the benefits of this program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then, if you have some questions for him about that program, he\xe2\x80\x99ll answer them and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll get on to some of the other things that might be on your mind today.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY ARNE:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Thrilled that the President is going to Mooresville today.\xc2\xa0 This is a huge deal for education for years to come.\xc2\xa0 And Mooresville is a fascinating school district.\xc2\xa0 I know this may not be exact, but out of like 117 districts in North Carolina, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re the 100th in terms of funding.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a well-funded district.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They made the courageous choice in about 2007 to stop buying textbooks, and they used all the money that they put in for textbooks to put in to technology.\xc2\xa0 So they have sort of paved the way on this move from print to digital.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been amazing to see not just increase in test scores, but significant increases in high school graduate rates.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I fundamentally think technology is a game changer.\xc2\xa0 It can empower students to be engaged in their own learning in really important ways.\xc2\xa0 Young people should have access to AP classes, to foreign language classes, to online tutoring.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic way to help teachers do their job better and engage them in really important ways.\xc2\xa0 Teachers can collaborate across the country with their peers.\xc2\xa0 They can individualize instruction in ways that just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to happen historically.</p>\n<p>This sounds like common sense.\xc2\xa0 It should be a no-brainer.\xc2\xa0 It just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen in this country.\xc2\xa0 And if we can invest to create access to high-speed broadband, we open up a new world of educational opportunity.</p>\n<p>So the President has challenged us and the FCC to look at what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xc2\xa0 The FCC has had the e-rate program for about 16, 17 years.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s done some great things.\xc2\xa0 But I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some real efficiencies there.\xc2\xa0 If this takes a temporary slight increase in fees for the short term to get this done, we think it\xe2\x80\x99s the best investment we can make.</p>\n<p>The final thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is not just about improving education; this to me is really about economic competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 This is the norm in countries like South Korea; this has already happened.\xc2\xa0 And as a country, I keep asking the question educationally -- are we going to be a leader or are we going to be a laggard?\xc2\xa0 And I want to keep good jobs in this country and a globally competitive economy with a knowledge workforce, jobs to go to where the most educated folks are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think the President is really challenging us and helping to create an opportunity where the United States could lead the world in terms of making sure students have access to a high-quality education regardless of where they live or their zip code or their own socio-economic status.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So a really big deal.\xc2\xa0 Mooresville gives you I think a glimpse of what should be the norm, but it\xe2\x80\x99s just simply not the case today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, did you bring this idea to the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it.\xc2\xa0 The superintendent in Mooresville is a good friend.\xc2\xa0 He has done a remarkable job.\xc2\xa0 He came in a while back and briefed our entire team on this.\xc2\xa0 I spend more and more of my time looking at what our counterparts are doing across the globe, because, again, we\'re not competing for jobs in a town or a county or state.\xc2\xa0 We\'re competing for jobs internationally.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I look at what other countries are doing.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re moving faster; they\'re investing more; they\'re innovating more.\xc2\xa0 South Korea, who has made this commitment, is already ahead of us educationally and we\'re trying to catch them.\xc2\xa0 And when I see examples of what works and what\'s possible, I think one of the things we can really do is shine a spotlight on best practices and try and take them to scale.</p>\n<p>So this is an example -- and the superintendent will be the first to say that their improvement is not -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t begin to have everything to do with technology.\xc2\xa0 Technology is an important lever and an important strategy.\xc2\xa0 But engaging students in their own learning, empowering teachers in very different ways, working with parents -- there\'s no magic answer, but this is a significant part of what\'s possible.\xc2\xa0 And to have a real demonstrative site -- this is not a community that has an abundance of wealth.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really, I think, a powerful example of what should be the norm, of what should be the norm across the nation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the temporary surcharge to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 Is there a dollar figure on what it would cost?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 The FCC has to look at this.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s really important the FCC looks at existing resources in the e-rate program.\xc2\xa0 And, again, over the past 16, 17 years there\'s been some really important progress.\xc2\xa0 Every school -- virtually every school in the nation now has access to the Internet.\xc2\xa0 But the stat that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of stunning is that the average school has less bandwidth than the average home.\xc2\xa0 Just sort of think about what that means -- if you think about how many more kids are in the school and if you want them to all have access at the same time to online learning, to video streams and those kinds of things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re just simply -- we\'re not in the game.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'re putting our students at a competitive disadvantage.\xc2\xa0 We\'re doing our teachers a disservice.\xc2\xa0 Some people ask if technology is going to somehow replace teachers.\xc2\xa0 That\'s never going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The answer is always great teachers empowered with great tools, with technology.\xc2\xa0 And as you survey teachers, less than 20 percent think they have what they need today.\xc2\xa0 Our teachers, we\xe2\x80\x99re asking so much of them.\xc2\xa0 This work is so hard and so important.\xc2\xa0 We owe it to them to give them the tools they need to be successful.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there a price tag on how much it would cost to wire up all the schools?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s really important that the FCC do that analysis, figure out what we could do with existing resources.\xc2\xa0 If there\'s a need on a temporary basis for some additional resources, we need to look at that.\xc2\xa0 But I really look forward to the FCC\'s leadership and expertise in that area.\xc2\xa0 And we just want to be a good partner, but they\'re going to do the hard work.\xc2\xa0 They\'re going to do the heavy lifting.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And none of this requires any congressional approval?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Which is the fantastic part of this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 We can get this done.\xc2\xa0 And our kids can\'t wait and our teachers can\'t wait.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to get better faster educationally in tough economic times.\xc2\xa0 We want to partner with Congress in everything we do.\xc2\xa0 And, as you know, we try to work in an absolutely bipartisan, nonpartisan way in everything we\'re doing.\xc2\xa0 But we have to educate our way to a better economy.\xc2\xa0 And the path to the middle class goes right through our nation\'s public schools.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\'re either going to see children in South Korea and India and China and Singapore have competitive advantages, or not.\xc2\xa0 And I just think that\'s not fair to our kids.\xc2\xa0 Our children are as smart, as talented, as committed, as entrepreneurial as children anywhere in the globe.\xc2\xa0 We just have to give them a chance to compete on a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 And today, quite frankly, we\'re not doing that.</p>\n<p>And what that means for our children and families, communities, and ultimately our country -- we have to do something better.\xc2\xa0 This is a really big deal what the President is talking about today.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s at least one story that all of you may be interested in:\xc2\xa0 the reports overnight about a purported order from a FISA judge, as reported.\xc2\xa0 So why don\'t I read a statement at the top just to give you a sense about where we are on this, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to answer your follow-up questions after that.\xc2\xa0 So if you\'ll bear with me, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do this.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to hear that I\'m not in a position to discuss specific classified or operational issues.\xc2\xa0 But what I can explain to you are our policies.\xc2\xa0 The Patriot Act was signed into law in October of 2001, and included authority to compel production of business records and other tangible details with the approval of a FISA Court.\xc2\xa0 This provision has subsequently been reauthorized over the course of two different administrations -- in 2006 and in 2011.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Obama administration has made public that some orders issued by the FISA Court, under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, have been used to support important and highly sensitive intelligence collection operations on which members of Congress have been fully and repeatedly briefed.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a couple of members of Congress in both parties today acknowledge that fact.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to a public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress and the intelligence community in both houses of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There is also extensive oversight by the executive branch, including the Department of Justice and relevant agency counsels and inspectors general, as well as annual and semi-annual reports to Congress, as required by law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There is a robust legal regime in place governing all activities conducted, pursuant to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act.\xc2\xa0 That regime has been briefed to and approved by the court.\xc2\xa0 And activities authorized under the act are subject to strict controls and procedures under oversight of the Department of Justice, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the FISA Court, to ensure that they comply with the Constitution and the laws of the United States and appropriately protect privacy and civil liberties.</p>\n<p>The order reprinted overnight does not allow the government to listen in on anyone\'s telephone calls.\xc2\xa0 The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the name of any subscriber.\xc2\xa0 It relates exclusively to call details, such as a telephone number or the length of a telephone call.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The information of the sort described in the article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terror threats as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>My final point here:\xc2\xa0 The President welcomes a discussion of the tradeoffs between security and civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 Many of you covered his speech at the National Defense University just a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 In that speech, the President said, "\xe2\x80\xa6in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are.\xc2\xa0 That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement so we can intercept new types of communication, but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President worry about the potential of overreach by the NSA under the Patriot Act?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The authorities that you\'re talking about were authorities that were in place before this President took office.\xc2\xa0 But when this President did take office, he put in place a stronger regime of oversight that included, as I described before, important notifications to relevant committees in Congress, but also important notifications to every member of Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There also is a requirement and important role to play for the judicial branch, including the FISA Court.\xc2\xa0 There is also an independent role to be played within the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a role for general counsels and even inspectors general to provide oversight in terms of how information is collected, and subsequently, how that information is used.\xc2\xa0 So there is a strict regime that\xe2\x80\x99s in place that has been in place for some time and was strengthened under this President.</p>\n<p>Now, the thing that I want to make clear is that the top priority of the President of the United States is the national security of the United States and protecting this homeland.\xc2\xa0 And we need to make sure that we have the tools we need to confront the threat posed by terrorists, to disrupt plots that may exist, and to otherwise protect the homeland.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to that.\xc2\xa0 That is his top priority.</p>\n<p>But what we need to do is we need to balance that priority with the need to protect the civil liberties and constitutional rights of the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that is the subject of a worthy debate -- that there are people who have a genuine interest in protecting the United States and protecting constitutional liberties -- constitutional rights and civil liberties that may disagree about how to strike this balance.\xc2\xa0 We welcome that debate.\xc2\xa0 The President has spent a lot of time thinking about this.\xc2\xa0 I think that was evident in his speech and I think that\'s evident from the way these programs have been conducted.</p>\n<p>But striking that balance and having a debate about how to strike that balance is something that the President and this administration welcomes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of members of Congress have suggested today that this was a renewal of an order to look at records -- or an order from the court has been in place actually for seven years.\xc2\xa0 Do you believe that that\'s accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not in a position to talk about purported orders, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re -- orders that are issued by FISA judges are classified, so I\'m not in a position to talk about those.\xc2\xa0 I\'m also not in a position to talk about operational details.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what I can tell you is that the authorities that are referenced by this purported order are something that have been in place for a number of years now, prior to this President taking office.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned, when this President took office, one of the decisions that he made was putting in place an oversight regime involving all three branches of government to provide oversight over the exercise of those authorities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I thought that the act made these records available to the government when sought, when they were in relation to a particular investigation.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that this relates to a specific investigation?\xc2\xa0 Even if you can\xe2\x80\x99t say what it is, can you say if it is a specific investigation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that -- I\'m not in a position to talk about this because a lot of the information that we\'re talking about here is classified.\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is that these authorities have been in place for quite some time, prior to this President taking office.\xc2\xa0 And these are authorities that, when acted upon, are regularly briefed to Congress, and when we act on these authorities, the judicial branch is involved in providing oversight.</p>\n<p>But in terms of specific operational details, I just can\'t get into them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can I just ask this -- it\xe2\x80\x99s an echo of Steve\xe2\x80\x99s question -- but in what the President said in his speech at the National Defense University, the part that you cited at the beginning of this briefing, does he believe that the interpretation of the law has perhaps become more flexible than he is comfortable with?\xc2\xa0 Is this something he\xe2\x80\x99s reacted to since this news broke or since it was last under discussion in the White House, that he thinks perhaps the meaning of the interpretation of the law needs to be tightened somewhat?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the President that there is in place a very strict oversight regime that, again, involves all three branches of government.\xc2\xa0 It includes a federal judge -- or judges.\xc2\xa0 It includes very robust congressional oversight, and an important role to play for inspectors general.\xc2\xa0 So even people who are independent within the executive branch have a role to play here, both in terms of how this information is collected and how this information is used.</p>\n<p>And this strict regime reflects the President\xe2\x80\x99s desire to strike the right balance between protecting our national security and protecting constitutional rights and civil liberties.\xc2\xa0 So this is something that the President spends a lot of time thinking about, and when he came into office he made some changes to ensure that the proper level of oversight was incorporated.</p>\n<p>That said, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that there are people that have a genuine interest in protecting our national security and who are committed to being thoughtful about protecting constitutional rights and civil liberties, and that the close examination of some of these complicated issues could cause people to arrive at differing opinions about how to implement -- about how the executive branch should exercise these authorities.\xc2\xa0 The President welcomes that debate.</p>\n<p>He\xe2\x80\x99s thought about this a lot.\xc2\xa0 He has his own ideas; he\xe2\x80\x99s presented them.\xc2\xa0 But he welcomes the debate and the different point of view from people who are informed and have the right perspective on this in terms of prioritizing our national security and who properly value the constitutional rights and civil liberties of the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify -- has every member of the House and Senate been briefed on this?\xc2\xa0 Because some, it seems, have been a little caught off-guard.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I want to read to you specifically from a letter that was sent by the Assistant Attorney General back in October of 2011 on this.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- it looks long, but I\xe2\x80\x99m only going to read you one line, which says, \xe2\x80\x9cIn December of 2009 and in February of 2011, the Department of Justice and the intelligence community provided a document to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees to be made available to all members of the House and Senate, describing the classified uses of Section 215 in detail.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Section 215 is the part of the Patriot Act that explains the authorities that are granted to the executive branch related to some of this surveillance.</p>\n<p>So I can get you a copy of this letter, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t already have it, that details that.\xc2\xa0 And I also think that Senator Chambliss today noted that every member of the Senate, as far as he knew, had been briefed on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Collins said otherwise.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Senator Collins and I think Senator Tester said otherwise as well.\xc2\xa0 And how do you reassure the American public that this information won\'t be misused for political purposes or purposes beyond the scope of intelligence, given what\'s been going on with the IRS and other sort of scandals?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the reason that an oversight regime is in place -- a strong oversight regime is in place is to protect the constitutional rights, the privacy, and the civil liberties of the American public.\xc2\xa0 So there are federal judges who are involved in making sure that this information is obtained and handled properly.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress are regularly briefed on this process.\xc2\xa0 There are also independent members of the executive branch who are briefed on this process so that they can provide proper oversight.</p>\n<p>But what I can tell you is that this is a -- that these decisions are made by national security professionals who have, as their priority, protecting our homeland and protecting the safety of American citizens.\xc2\xa0 But there is a very strict oversight regime in place that includes all three branches to make sure that the constitutional rights and privacy of the American public are protected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, the President is comfortable with the NSA domestic surveillance program as it stands today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we have in place a very strong oversight regime that includes all three branches of government, and that that strong oversight is a key part of balancing the need to protect our national security and protect the constitutional rights and civil liberties of American citizens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And at the same time, we understand that there might be people who have looked at these facts who have the right values in terms of they believe that our security is a priority, they believe that protecting constitutional rights is a priority.\xc2\xa0 And they may arrive at a different opinion.\xc2\xa0 And if they want to have a debate and a discussion about striking that right balance, we welcome that discussion.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he willing to change anything based on looking at these facts, as you say?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the strict oversight regime that\xe2\x80\x99s in place is in place because the President put it there.\xc2\xa0 But if there are people that have a different opinion about how to appropriately strike the balance between our national security and civil liberties, the President is welcome to have that conversation with individuals.\xc2\xa0 But he is also more than willing to have a broader public debate about this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The American people have a legitimate stake in the outcome of this discussion.\xc2\xa0 So he welcomes, to the extent practicable, talking about some classified issues here.\xc2\xa0 But to the extent practicable, he believes that there is a legitimate public debate that can be had about this as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have other telecom companies besides Verizon been asked to turn over records?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to offer up any additional operational details about this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect the President to come out and talk about this at some point?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that this will be part of the President\'s remarks today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not necessarily today, but at some point as people become more aware of what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule it out.\xc2\xa0 He incorporated a speech on this exact issue -- or he incorporated his thoughts on this exact issue in the speech that he gave a couple of weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 So it certainly wouldn\'t be a surprise to me that he might bring this up again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the government investigate this leak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those are decisions that are made by the Department of Justice, by law enforcement personnel over there.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d refer that question to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 DOJ has said that there\xe2\x80\x99s been reports that they are investigating this leak.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'ve seen those reports, but I can\'t comment on the veracity of those reports.\xc2\xa0 So I\'d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we just talk about just more about of what Lisa said, the general perception of this just being one more thing that the American people are seeing after a long line*?\xc2\xa0 Has the President continued to push his message and his agenda when he\xe2\x80\x99s just so distracted by yet another thing?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that the President is not distracted.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on the core part of his domestic agenda, which is expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That, after all, is why we\'re on this plane to North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to the opportunity to talk about it, as Secretary Duncan just mentioned\xc2\xa0 -- the difference that smart investments in technology can have in our education system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the reason that we\'re talking about that issue is because a high-quality education is so critical to expanding economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that if we\'re going to strengthen our economy, we need to have a strong and thriving and growing middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President is focused on.\xc2\xa0 And he\'s not at all distracted from that priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one question not related to this -- about immigration?\xc2\xa0 Last night, there was a stalemate in the House.\xc2\xa0 What does the White House think about the lack of an agreement from the House when -- the Congressman leaving the talks from the Gang of Eight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of those reports.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of insight into the private negotiations that are going on in the House, but obviously there is some bipartisan progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made in the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to the compromise immigration proposal that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward coming to the Senate floor next week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would expect a pretty robust debate on a range of issues related to that piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I know that there are many amendments that have already been considered in committee that will also be considered on the floor of the Senate.</p>\n<p>This is a compromise proposal.\xc2\xa0 Not everybody is going to get what they want, but at the end of the day we\'re optimistic that if we\'re going to have a common-sense immigration reform package that largely reflects the principles that the President has laid out, and that will also get bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\'re encouraged by.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re getting close.\xc2\xa0 Is there any -- we\'re done?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:24 P.M.
