Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:06 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wow, kind of a light crowd.\xc2\xa0 Everybody is outside still, right?\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here -- those of you who are here -- for your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\'t have any announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 I do have before me the week ahead, which I will make after I forget and you remind me, at the -- I\'ll deliver that at the end of the briefing.\xc2\xa0 But with that, I will go to questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tKen.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why did the President decide to weigh in on the shooting death of Trayvon Martin today?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ken, the President has given a number of interviews in the last several days.\xc2\xa0 This has been a major news story, as you know, and so he was certainly prepared to answer a question if he were to get one.\xc2\xa0 It is also true that some of you have asked me over recent days whether or not the President was aware of the incident, what he thought about it, and I chose not to talk about private conversations.\xc2\xa0 But as you could tell from the answer the President gave, obviously he is aware of it, was aware of it, and has thought about it.\xc2\xa0 And he shared his thoughts on the case today with you.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s my answer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The White House had appeared to be reluctant to talk about this case.\xc2\xa0 Was there some development?\xc2\xa0 Was there something that touched a nerve with the President where he wanted to speak out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think given that he\'s President of the United States and he\'s going to speak with you all and other reports with some regularity, it was inevitable, given the high-profile nature of this story, that he would be asked about it.\xc2\xa0 He was certainly -- had thought about it, was aware of what\'s happening with regard to it in terms of the investigation locally, by local law enforcement, the task force now that\'s been established by the governor of Florida, as well as the Department of Justice\'s investigation.\xc2\xa0 So given all that, it was inevitable probably that he would be asked about it, so he was -- he had thought about it and was prepared to answer that question when he got it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have any intention to call Trayvon\'s parents?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information in that regard, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tJeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, in the aftermath of this morning\'s announcement before that comment about the World Bank, can you tell us a little bit about how the President chose Mr. Kim?\xc2\xa0 How did -- at what point did he select him?\xc2\xa0 And what are some of the background details to this, what would seem to be a surprise announcement?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, he looked at all the reports in the press with lists of names, and he took those and then he added to them other candidates -- no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 This was a very deliberative process.\xc2\xa0 And the President understands the importance of the World Bank.\xc2\xa0 As he mentioned today, its name doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really convey everything that the World Bank does and its important work.\xc2\xa0 And he wanted to find someone who was really perfectly suited for the World Bank\'s activities, especially now, in this time in history.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tDr. Kim represented, with his combination of experience and expertise, the variety of things he\'s done in development and health, as well as, of course, being president of Dartmouth College, he represented to the President the ideal candidate for the job.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he chose to nominate him.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When did the President first meet Dr. Kim?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure when they first met.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about who in the administration proposed him, or who may have been advocating for him?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner were advocates.\xc2\xa0 I believe Secretary Clinton might have been the first to suggest Dr. Kim.\xc2\xa0 Both those individuals were supporters of the idea -- which is not to suggest that others who were under consideration were not also seriously considered and supported by very senior advisors to the President.\xc2\xa0 They were.\xc2\xa0 There were a number of highly qualified individuals considered.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what some of those names were now that you\'ve announced the winner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to go -- I think some names that have been out there are accurate.\xc2\xa0 Look, a lot of them are people that the President relies on to this day for advice and counsel and guidance, including Larry Summers, including Ambassador Rice, including Senator Kerry, among three names that have been talked about, and those three individuals certainly are people that the President depends on quite a bit for their wisdom and counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did any of them turn it down before he chose --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think some of it\'s been reported, others have spoken to this; I\'ll let them do it for themselves.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to make a point that while the President feels very strongly that Dr. Kim\'s combination of experience and expertise and vision make him the ideal candidate, there were a number of very qualified candidates who -- people who were considered by the President and who -- some of whom weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested, some of whom -- all of whom the President relies on very strongly for advice and will continue to rely on.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was Dr. Kim his first choice?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\tDan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Earlier in the week, when you were asked to comment on the Trayvon Martin case, either from you or something the President may have said, you said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to wade into a local law enforcement matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What changed between then and now that caused the President to want to answer this question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, the President, as I just mentioned, was inevitably going to be asked this given its prominence and the fact that he has interviews with the reporters.\xc2\xa0 Two, the President very --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He could have passed --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s clear, he could have.\xc2\xa0 But he felt -- he did have some have thoughts on the matter.\xc2\xa0 He made clear at the top of his comments the importance he attaches to not -- to being careful about it because of the investigations that are ongoing. But he clearly had some thoughts about it as a parent and expressed those to you today.\xc2\xa0 So I think you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate on what the President said because I think he spoke pretty eloquently about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question on the health care reform law.\xc2\xa0 Today, you have no doubt seen all of the attacks that have been brought on this White House, this administration, on the two-year anniversary.\xc2\xa0 The RNC in a statement said that, \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Obama is not celebrating.\xc2\xa0 He would rather Americans forget about his signature accomplishment because today it is a massive, undeniable failure, and a heap of broken promises.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What is your response to some of this talk from Republicans and other Americans out there who are clearly still unhappy with health care reform?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a couple of things to your last point.\xc2\xa0 I think there was a story just recently about the disparity in the amount of money spent in the propaganda PR wars on this issue -- 3-to-1, at least, spent against the Affordable Care Act in efforts to mischaracterize it and mislead Americans about what it is, versus those who advocated in favor of expanding health care coverage for 30 million Americans, expanding coverage for young Americans, expanding coverage for seniors by building on the private sector system that we have -- the private health insurance system that we have.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of misinformation about what the Affordable Care Act is.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve released a comprehensive report on the Affordable Care Act at its two-year anniversary today.\xc2\xa0 The President is very proud of the work that Congress did and his administration did to make this 100-year quest a reality.\xc2\xa0 And we are focused on implementing that bill, that law.\xc2\xa0 Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 2.5 million more young adults have health insurance on their parent\'s plan; 5.1 million seniors with Medicare saved $3.2 billion on their prescription drugs, and everyone on Medicare can get preventive services like mammograms now for free.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tInsurance companies must spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollars on health care and not overhead, and cannot raise your premiums by 10 percent or more with not accountability.\xc2\xa0 It is illegal now for insurance companies to deny coverage to children because of a preexisting condition, and in 2014, discriminating against anyone with a preexisting condition will be illegal.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, what the RNC and others who are critics of this leave out in their attacks is that they want to go back to a system where insurance companies have all the rules on their side -- not consumers, not the American people; where they can deny your coverage like that (snaps fingers) if you have a preexisting condition; where they can say no if you want to add your child to your health insurance policy; where they can throw you off your insurance policy if you get sick.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are some of the benefits that critics would repeal.\xc2\xa0 And the President strongly believes that is a mistake, and he certainly will not shy away from the opportunity to debate that vision versus his own when it comes to providing health care to the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnn, and then April.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President, with his constitutional law background, does he have an interest in looking at what the Solicitor General is going to argue on Monday?\xc2\xa0 Has he asked to see any of the briefs on the Supreme Court arguments expected next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Honestly, Ann, I don\'t know if he has reviewed the briefs.\xc2\xa0 I know that he has great confidence in the Solicitor General and great confidence in the argument that will be made that, as we have said repeatedly, that the provision under review by the Court is definitely constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been part of any kind of review about the administration\'s position, government\'s position --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know that he\'s been briefed on it, and he has had discussions about it, but nothing too substantive that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the Florida shooting -- the President mentioned that the country should do some soul-searching, not just on the law, but the context of how it happened.\xc2\xa0 Does he think this is another one of those teachable moments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to elaborate on what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I think he spoke about it, and I\'ll leave it at what he said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is, as many have said today and previously, the President believes this is a tragedy.\xc2\xa0 And as a parent, he can feel that, as you and other folks who are parents can understand, even more keenly the kind of grief that the Martins are suffering right now.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an observation that is broadly and widely shared.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeyond that, I\'ll let the President\'s words stand.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll certainly let the investigations proceed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Trayvon Martin issue.\xc2\xa0 You said the President believes this is a major news story.\xc2\xa0 As a major news story, what has the President --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- sorry.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What has the President gotten?\xc2\xa0 Has he listened to the tapes?\xc2\xa0 And what kind of -- just on the tick-tock issue, what kind of information -- is he being updated by Justice?\xc2\xa0 Because I understand that Justice had a whole day at the early part of this week, they were trying to figure out how to handle the situation, and sending people there to help lessen tensions and things of that nature.\xc2\xa0 How has the President been involved leading up to today in this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As far as how he gets his news, I think I\'ve said on a number of occasions, he largely reads the news.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m sure --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he hear the tapes at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 But of course, I\'m with him a lot but not all the time.\xc2\xa0 In my presence, he did not.\xc2\xa0 But I think he mostly reads about stories like this.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- it\'s not a question of believing if this is a big news story.\xc2\xa0 If you watch the news or read the newspaper, I think it is definitively a big story.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he -- we certainly expected that he would be asked about it at some point.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other matter, I don\'t -- not that I\'m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think -- he gets regular briefings from his senior advisors and updates on things.\xc2\xa0 But not -- there has not been, to my knowledge, any focused conversation or meeting involving the President on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also you said that you had not heard that the President had reached out and called the Martin family as of yet. He has typically done things like that in the past with other situations.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect that that could be a possibility --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s what I was asked, whether he planned to, and I don\'t have any updates on phone calls he may or may not make in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is he reaching out -- has he talked to Al Sharpton and Ben Jealous about this situation, particularly as --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the issue of racial profiling has been raised?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of, April.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on another subject, what do you think about this -- the controversy about the Etch-a-Sketch?\xc2\xa0 Not the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have one at home.\xc2\xa0 My children have one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have yours, too?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t bring that in, no.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you think about the controversy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I was asked this I think yesterday or the day before on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 And we -- I and others watch with interest the developments in the Republican primary, but we\'re focused on the work we\'re doing here.\xc2\xa0 The President is very focused on the work he\'s doing.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have much comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, eight months out from the general election, all he has to do -- Mitt Romney -- is to shake and reset himself.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that, eight months out, a major candidate should be resetting themselves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the effort, but I will not -- (laughter) -- (someone shows their Etch-a-Sketch.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much did it cost?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much did it cost?\xc2\xa0 About $5.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you actually have one at home?\xc2\xa0 You said you had one at home?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have two children.\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have an Etch-a-Sketch.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you ever play?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s been a while.\xc2\xa0 My kids are getting a little older.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you use it at the office?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not brought it in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did say Mark was next.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, despite what you\'ve said about the second anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, it\'s still not clear to me why the President didn\'t choose this anniversary to do an event, make a statement.\xc2\xa0 Yes, you\'ve done a report, but it just seems unnatural.\xc2\xa0 Do you see this as a political liability?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I would refer you to the campaign to talk about what the campaign is doing.\xc2\xa0 As many of you have and hopefully millions and millions of Americans have, in my -- or maybe millions and millions of Americans have -- the campaign has put out a video, which I think features, among other things, the significant accomplishment that the Affordable Care Act represents.\xc2\xa0 We have put out the report today that includes a statement by the President on the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are focused, as an administration, on implementing the Affordable Care Act so that all of its benefits will be in place for Americans receiving health insurance and health benefits.\xc2\xa0 That is, I think, a pretty full plate of things that we are doing with regards to the Affordable Care Act and, specifically, to make note of and mark the anniversary of the signing.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, this was a -- the important thing about the Affordable Care Act is what it does.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the administration is focused on.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Sebelius, Secretary Solis, Valerie Jarrett, others have been involved in highlighting some of the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act this week, and will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And the President speaks frequently about the Affordable Care Act at events.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I made the point the other day that the anniversary is not something that the President is going to have an event around, but it is quite clearly a major accomplishment for him and for the administration, for the Congress -- one that was the result of literally a century\'s worth of effort by leaders in Washington, and which has resulted in already the benefits that I numerated in answer to a previous question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the administration making any preparations for the possibility that the Supreme Court will rule against the individual mandate at the end of the term?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to HHS, but not that I\'m aware.\xc2\xa0 We are, of course, actively working with the states to implement the law, the exchanges, the other provisions of it, and believe very strongly in the argument that the Affordable Care Act in its entirety is constitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\tEd.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Trayvon Martin.\xc2\xa0 Since the President does have strong feelings, as you said and as he said, why did it take the Justice Department so long to intervene if this young man was killed on February 26 -- admittedly, the media didn\xe2\x80\x99t jump on it early either.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not perfect; it was not something that got national attention right away.\xc2\xa0 However, the Justice Department is there to protect people\'s rights.\xc2\xa0 In retrospect, do you think that the Justice Department was too slow to get involved?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer your question to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 Justice is investigating this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\'s the President\'s Attorney General --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Justice Department for their procedures and how they look into matters like this and make decisions about investigating.\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a different subject, TSA.\xc2\xa0 There\'s been some controversy about the administration trying to cut back on armed pilots -- it\'s a program, the Flight Deck Officers program.\xc2\xa0 Is that anything that you focused on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure you should largely seek your answer over at TSA.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After the President\'s announcement for his nominee for the World Bank, there\'s been some blowback, even some harsh criticism from people in India, in Brazil and other emerging economies.\xc2\xa0 Their argument is that it\'s about time for a non-American to take that post; it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an automatic.\xc2\xa0 What\'s your reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the President nominated someone today that he believes will be an exceptional president of the World Bank, and whose experience in the field that is the central principle behind the World Bank\'s mission -- that is, to reduce poverty and support development -- is broad and extensive.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe have already seen extensive support for the nomination, statements of support not just from Americans like former President Bill Clinton and Paul Farmer, but the Rwandan President, Kagame, who says, \xe2\x80\x9cI was delighted to learn that Jim Kim has been nominated for this post, as he is a true friend of Africa and well known for his decade of work to support us in developing an efficient health system in Rwanda.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think his -- we certainly hope that, and have seen already, that Dr. Kim will receive broad international support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s assuming he is confirmed by the board.\xc2\xa0 When do citizens of emerging economies get their shot?\xc2\xa0 When does it stop being an automatic that being an American citizen --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My extensive -- or not so extensive research into the history of the World Bank and how its leaders are chosen has been exhausted already.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I think you ought to take your question perhaps to State or Treasury.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, let me follow up from the Rose Garden.\xc2\xa0 The President -- the one sentence that the President uttered out there, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had a son he\xe2\x80\x99d look like Trayvon,\xe2\x80\x9d is the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s really driving the coverage of that, his statement today. What exactly does he mean by that?\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he spoke very clearly and thoughtfully about, on the personal side, his reactions to this case, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate on that.\xc2\xa0 The President has spoken and I\xe2\x80\x99ll point you to what he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Jared.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up, Andrei?\xc2\xa0 In a second.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when the President marks the anniversaries of legislation like the Lilly Ledbetter Act, or when he marks the anniversaries of major events -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that there might be something on May 1st for the anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden -- I just -- anniversaries do matter, so I guess -- I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand why even compared to its siblings, other legislation -- I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s kicked out even just statements for things like Roe v. Wade -- so state legislations, Supreme Court decisions, major events -- why does this one among its siblings not get some kind of bigger marker?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how else I can answer the question.\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered it a number of ways over a number of days.\xc2\xa0 The implication is somehow that it is not an anniversary that is significant and therefore the underlying accomplishment is not significant.\xc2\xa0 Everything we have done and he has done and he had said proves otherwise.\xc2\xa0 The lack of an event on a day when he announces the World Bank, a day when he has other meetings, and a day when he flies to Korea should not suggest otherwise.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are focused on the implementation of it.\xc2\xa0 And if the -- but again, I think you need to examine the premise behind these questions, because if the implication is that we are somehow not, and the President is not, fully taking ownership of the Affordable Care Act, I mean, look at everything else that says that that\xe2\x80\x99s a ridiculous assertion, including, again, as somebody who has simply watched it, as anyone else can, online, look at the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s video -- because this is all, like most questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking, in the context of the campaign.\xc2\xa0 And somebody said, oh, is it a problem politically?\xc2\xa0 Well, it certainly looks to me, as an observer, that the campaign doesn\'t think so -- the President\'s campaign doesn\'t think so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the report that we put out today suggests we don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that the critics of the reform have no answer to the question, would you then have it be the way it was before when insurance companies could throw you off if you got sick, or they could prevent you from getting insurance or your child from getting insurance because he or she has a preexisting condition\xc2\xa0 -- they have no answer to that.\xc2\xa0 So this is not a debate we will shy away from.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other thing, Jay, about the President, when he was on the -- on an official event last night, there was an interaction with someone who was interrupting the President.\xc2\xa0 And he said, if you -- something along the lines of, if you want to have your own rally.\xc2\xa0 Was the President campaigning that night or even in that moment?\xc2\xa0 Because the work "rally" just seems like a loaded campaign word.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just trying to figure out if the President was campaigning or if this was an official event.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jared, he was at Ohio State University, where they have developed the fastest electric car in the world, at 308 miles per hour.\xc2\xa0 And they\'re developing one that can go 400 miles per hour. That\'s an amazing thing, right?\xc2\xa0 I know, he wishes he could test-drive it, as I did.\xc2\xa0 But the -- as part of a two-day trip to highlight his all-of-the-above energy strategy, which includes, obviously, a focus on development of battery technology, which is the essential ingredient to these kinds of automobiles.\xc2\xa0 So the answer to your question is, no.\xc2\xa0 The gentleman that you\'re referring to was very persistent, and anybody who was there obviously wanted to have himself heard, and the President accepted the book that he passed up.\xc2\xa0 But that was really all there was to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President doesn\'t think he\'s campaigning when he\'s at that event?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Jared, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 But thank you for the question.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- talk about the Korea trip, and specifically the DMZ visit.\xc2\xa0 I know we\'ve talked with your colleagues before on the call about this.\xc2\xa0 But the President has been to Korea before.\xc2\xa0 This is the first time he\'s visiting the DMZ.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you on camera, is this a poke in the eye for the new Korean leadership that has taken place since the other visits?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it is something that, obviously, previous Presidents have done.\xc2\xa0 This President is looking forward to visiting the DMZ.\xc2\xa0 I think it is -- reflects the commitment to our South Korean allies, to the security of South Korea.\xc2\xa0 It reflects the President\'s appreciation for the U.S. troops who are stationed in Korea.\xc2\xa0 It is not about change of leadership in North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\tOur issues with North Korea are today as they were in the past, and we\'re continuing to focus on that as part of the overall issue of nuclear security.\xc2\xa0 The summit itself, which the President initiated with the summit he held here in Washington, reflects his extraordinary commitment to the issue of nuclear security globally -- because there is really no greater threat to the security of the American people than the potential for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is why he is focused both on the supply and the demand of this problem -- the demand being terrorist groups, principally al Qaeda, that seek to harm Americans.\xc2\xa0 He has focused very aggressively the fight against al Qaeda, as you know, and he has focused and his entire administration has focused on working with the 50 nations who are a party of the summit on the issue of securing loose nuclear materials and preventing them from getting into the hands of terrorists.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the deal with North Korea, in the President\'s view, now a dead letter because of the nuclear -- because of the satellite launch that is scheduled?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, the deal?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, sorry, the separate -- let\'s rephrase that.\xc2\xa0 Is\xc2\xa0 -- are the separate developments that are expected -- the North Korean nuclear freeze, the shipment of food -- however you care to characterize it -- is the hope for a breakthrough with North Korea a dead letter because of the satellite launch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I made very clear, and others have, our view of the proposed launch and the violation it represents of North Korea\'s nuclear obligations and the very dim view we take of that and how -- the impact it might have on the food program.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any updates for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoger.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick follow-up on --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be addressing the satellite launch, perhaps when he visits the DMZ?\xc2\xa0 Or how will he address that?\xc2\xa0 Or will he?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\'ll have to see.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements that the President might make or statements that he might make that I\'m going to make from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrei.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 And we do cover the Trayvon case, too, so I do have a follow-up --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just get follow-ups on everything today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But my follow-up was on the World Bank.\xc2\xa0 Does the President intend to lobby personally for his candidate -- talk to his international counterparts maybe in the coming week or elsewhere?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly may.\xc2\xa0 He feels very strongly that Dr. Kim is an excellent nominee, an excellent candidate, the right person for this job at this time.\xc2\xa0 I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude that possibility.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I haven\'t had that conversation with him or heard it discussed within the context of this summit.\xc2\xa0 But we are certainly advocating for Dr. Kim.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, secondly, I\'ll just say in the same vein, he\'s not running unopposed.\xc2\xa0 The Nigerian Minister of Finance of Economy has been put forward -- she has a difficult name, but she has a strong reputation and professional qualifications.\xc2\xa0 She used to run the World Bank Group as managing director.\xc2\xa0 So what makes your candidate better than she is?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not going to get into a comparison of this candidate to others, except to say that this candidate, the President\'s nominee, is extremely qualified, has a broad diversity of experience within the very fields that are central to the World Bank\'s mission.\xc2\xa0 And the President certainly hopes that he will win the support at the World Bank and from the board and become the next president.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, on Korea.\xc2\xa0 And then -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Korean trip, as the President heads to South Korea, does he regard North Korea or Iran as a greater threat to global security regarding nuclear weapons?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean between the two?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have a ranking.\xc2\xa0 I think we\'re concerned about both nations and their -- in the case of North Korea, the fact that they -- what they\'ve done on nuclear weapons; and then, on Iran, the obvious violations of their international obligations and their refusal to give up their nuclear weapons ambitions.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo both -- actions by both countries, by both regimes threaten regional stability and threaten the nuclear security of the globe.\xc2\xa0 So that is why this administration is so focused on preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, and why it is focused on working with our allies to get North Korea to give up its nuclear program so that it can rejoin the community of nations.\xc2\xa0 These are both very important issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given how personal the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks were on the Trayvon Martin shooting, was he -- and this might come off wrong -- but was he eager to talk about it?\xc2\xa0 Did he want to talk about it?\xc2\xa0 I know you said it was inevitable, but --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He can obviously choose to answer a question or not, so he chose to answer this and had some thoughts to offer on it.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to psychoanalyze him for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Is the President fully convinced that this is the right time to resume military aid for Egypt?\xc2\xa0 And does he have full confidence in the military council that is committed to transition to civilian leadership?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you on our position about that.\xc2\xa0 I think the State Department has provided information on this.\xc2\xa0 Egypt is an important ally in the region.\xc2\xa0 We have worked closely with Egypt in this period of transition and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 But for specifics about the decisions with regard to military aid I think I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the State Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tSteve.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Vice President this morning in his speech was very critical of Mitt Romney and his Social Security proposals to raise the retirement age and slow the growth of benefits.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House position on Social Security?\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see an proposals, specifics proposals before the election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think you saw in the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- both in his State of the Union last year and the President\xe2\x80\x99s deficit reduction proposal from September, that we believe that we can work together to take steps to improve Social Security, but that the immediate -- with regard to entitlements, the more immediate issue that needs to be addressed is Medicare.\xc2\xa0 And the President put forward in his budget proposals on entitlements that part of a balanced approach to getting the kind of significant deficit reduction that we need to get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new proposals to suggest to you that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make.\xc2\xa0 But the President is very focused on the need to deal with our deficit and debt problems and do it in a way that does not unfairly burden certain segments of society, and that would include obviously seniors.\xc2\xa0 One of the problems that we have with the Ryan/Republican proposal, both iterations -- which is clearly becoming the Republican proposal -- I think that candidates for office have endorsed it -- is that it is so unbalanced.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt does not -- the key element of any plausible proposal to get our deficits and debt under control is that it have balance so that it is not unfairly burdensome to any sector of American society.\xc2\xa0 That has been recognized by not just Democrats, not just the President, but Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Republican leaders on this issue have said it has to have balance.\xc2\xa0 It has to include not just discretionary cuts, not just defense cuts, not just reforms of entitlement programs, but revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor some reason, even though this is established, moderate, reasonable thinking from leaders of both parties on this issue, the Ryan budget, the Republican budget, the budget that Republicans seem to be rallying behind doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, it does the opposite.\xc2\xa0 It gives more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans -- and to pay for them, asks seniors and others to foot the bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on Social Security --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- tax increase on Social Security.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about a balanced approach to that, are you?\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that there should be a tax increase --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has a plan that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward. I have no proposals beyond the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan to provide to you.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is we can get a handle on our deficits and debt if we take the balanced approach that the President put forward, that the Simpson-Bowles commission put forward, that the Rivlin-Domenici commission put forward, that the Gang of Six put forward.\xc2\xa0 The three -- the last three included Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Only the President\'s proposal and -- I mean, you guys can conclude on your own and make an analysis of why Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t support it.\xc2\xa0 Because leading Republicans have supported balanced approaches to this problem.\xc2\xa0 They should support a balanced approach when it comes to actually getting it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, in the back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A question on the President\'s trip to Korea.\xc2\xa0 North Korea just say any statement coming out about their nuclear weapon they would take as a declaration of war.\xc2\xa0 So how\xc2\xa0 -- I just want to know what\'s the reaction of the White House to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I hadn\'t heard that statement, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a reaction for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, given the worldwide financial upheavals in recent years, world leaders have been talking about reforms of the world financial systems.\xc2\xa0 But with the heads of IMF and World Bank still coming out of Europe and the United States, just like decades ago, does the White House believe that such reform has been proceeding on a satisfactory pace or anything?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure -- I understand that this is a question that is loosely pegged to the announcement of our nominee for the World Bank president.\xc2\xa0 I think the World Bank\'s mission is focused on reducing poverty and supporting development, not the international financial system.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut this President, in the midst of a dire financial crisis that threatened to cause a global meltdown, acted quite aggressively to prevent the meltdown, and has passed, with Congress\'s support, a law that reforms Wall Street and ensures that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same kind of situation that helped precipitate the global financial crisis in 2007, 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that experience is an experience that we share with others around the globe, and the lessons that we learned from it. And this I think is something I\'ve talked about when we discussed the European -- the eurozone crisis and the efforts there to get a handle on that, and the fact that Secretary Geithner has been very engaged with his European counterparts on that issue and offering the kind of advice that he can, having personally been involved in the crisis here and the efforts to end it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut beyond that, I\'m not sure that the announcement today goes particularly to your question.</p>\n<p>\n\tDonovan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I want to go back for a minute to the health care anniversary.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans obviously are celebrating the anniversary -- I think they put a banner up and all of this.\xc2\xa0 And you said earlier today that the propaganda spending against the health care law was like 3 to 1.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t an appearance or an event by the President help offset that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are focused on implementing the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 We also support those who are marking the anniversary, those who support -- who are marking it and are supportive of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 We have put out our own report.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere will be -- you put it in the political context, which is the only context within which Republicans put it, because they have no policy that\xe2\x80\x99s an answer to the need for health care reform.\xc2\xa0 And there will be an opportunity for the President to debate the merits of reforming our health care system in a way that builds on the private sector -- private insurance system that we have, but does not allow insurance companies to deprive Americans of health insurance because they develop an illness, or prevent them from getting health insurance because they have preexisting conditions, and puts other restrictions on insurance companies to ensure that they spend at least 80 percent of your premium dollars on health care and not overhead, that they can\'t raise your premiums by 10 percent or more with no accountability.</p>\n<p>\n\tI mean, this is the other side of the argument.\xc2\xa0 And that debate will be engaged in the fall if the Republican nominee feels so strongly about it.\xc2\xa0 It will be an interesting debate, no doubt, should at a political level, one of the architects of this health care reform, be the nominee for the Republican Party -- because, as many have noted in both parties, the individual mandate provision of the President\'s Affordable Care Act bears striking similarity to the individual mandate that was put in place in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>\n\tAny others?\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, earlier this week, Elizabeth Warren told me she wants to see the President complete his evolution on same-sex marriage --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that story by you, Chris.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was pretty cool, wasn\'t it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re a star.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyway, Elizabeth Warren said that marriage equality is morally right.\xc2\xa0 Will the President take her advice before the November election?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris, I have no updates for you on that issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As chair on the congressional panel overseeing TARP reforms, Ms. Warren oversaw the distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars to banks on the verge of collapse, and she also served as special assistant to the President on the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\xc2\xa0 So if the President is going to take her advice on these very complex issues, why wouldn\'t he do so on this very simple issue of marriage?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President appreciates Elizabeth Warren\'s advice and service that she provided on these very critical issues that you talked about.\xc2\xa0 And he gets advice from people he respects on a variety of issues and he listens very carefully to that advice on those varieties of issues, and then he makes his decisions when he\'s ready to make them, and talks about them when he\'s got news to talk about.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I have one brief --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei -- (speaks in Russian).\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does Dr. Kim want the job of the President of the World Bank?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t he say so?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, my knowledge of the history of this is not complete, but when you\'re nominated for a job -- I think this is true when you -- at least in our system, when we nominate potential Cabinet secretaries, you don\'t come out and make your case.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t speak?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s always the case.\xc2\xa0 But in any -- I\'m certain that Dr. Kim has graciously agreed to serve if confirmed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you graciously provide us with the week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will graciously provide --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just said a minute ago?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just said, "Andrei, please, what?"</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You, too?\xc2\xa0 Oh, you.\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWeek ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Sunday morning, the President will arrive in Seoul, Republic of Korea.\xc2\xa0 Later in the morning, the President will visit the Demilitarized Zone, also known as the DMZ.\xc2\xa0 At the Demilitarized Zone, the President will meet with American troops serving on the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the afternoon, the President will hold a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Erdogan of Turkey at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\xc2\xa0 Later, the President will visit the Blue House where he will attend a bilateral meeting with President Lee of the Republic of Korea, hold a joint news conference with President Lee, and attend a dinner with President Lee.\xc2\xa0 The President will spend the night in Seoul.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday morning, the President will deliver remarks at Hankuk University in Seoul on his ongoing commitment to our continued efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 Later in the day, the President will hold bilateral meetings with President Medvedev of Russia, President Hu Jintao of China, and President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.\xc2\xa0 In the evening, the President will attend a Nuclear Security Summit working dinner.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will attend the Nuclear Security Summit.\xc2\xa0 Later in the day, the President will depart Seoul, en route Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The President will arrive in Washington, due to the changing time zones, on Tuesday evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday and Thursday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will attend campaign events in Burlington, Vermont and Portland, Maine.\xc2\xa0 He will return to Washington, D.C. that evening.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that is your week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:51 P.M.
