Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t*Please see below for a clarification marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t1:02 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you.\xc2\xa0 I do not have any announcements at the top, so we can go straight to questions.\xc2\xa0 Kevin, would you like to start?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask about the timing of the fundraisers in New York City tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 Were they planned so the President could hit the trail running for Hillary Clinton on the heels of today\xe2\x80\x99s primary?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 These fundraisers have been on the books for quite some time.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t believe that most people expected that the Democratic nomination would continue to be contested into the first week in June.\xc2\xa0 So I can tell you that the President does not expect to see or meet or appear with Secretary Clinton when he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll be focused on a schedule that involves two fundraisers and the taping of the Tonight Show.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As the President indicated this morning, the leaders of the world\xe2\x80\x99s two largest democracies are meeting today.\xc2\xa0 And yet the decision was made not to take questions from the reporters.\xc2\xa0 Can you go into why?\xc2\xa0 And is the administration disappointed that eight years after the reaching of a civil nuclear accord with India that U.S. companies have yet to finalize a contract to build a reactor there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say that the schedule that was laid out for the President and the Prime Minister was to give them the opportunity to meet privately in the Oval Office and then to spend some time talking with all of you about their meeting.\xc2\xa0 And they left -- after doing so, they have begun a private lunch that\'s taking place in the Cabinet Room even as we speak.\xc2\xa0 So there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an opportunity to take questions today.\xc2\xa0 Typically, when the President does meet with world leaders, they will often have a formal news conference.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I believe they may have done that the last time that Prime Minister Modi was here.\xc2\xa0 But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that today.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the announcements -- the discussion with the Prime Minister, there was extensive discussion about the leading role that India played in achieving an international agreement to fight climate change and fight carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve said on many occasions that India\xe2\x80\x99s role in that process was significant, and it\'s unlikely that we would have actually reached an agreement in Paris last December had the Indians not stepped up in terms of leadership in making some substantial commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that really is a testament to Prime Minister Modi and his willingness to take a political risk to do what he thinks is right, not just for his country but for the planet.\xc2\xa0 And he deserves a lot of credit for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I\'ll also say is that Prime Minister Modi recognizes that there\xe2\x80\x99s an important economic opportunity here.\xc2\xa0 President Obama certainly recognizes that.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve made the case, and as more countries around the world consider the move to a low-carbon economy that creates important opportunities in the alternative energy sector.\xc2\xa0 And there certainly are important opportunities for American businesses, even in India, in the solar sector and in the wind energy sector.\xc2\xa0 There also is an opportunity for the United States to work with countries around the world to develop further nuclear energy technology.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd there was a discussion between the two leaders about the investment in infrastructure in India.\xc2\xa0 And we were pleased to see India announce that it intends to build six Westinghouse nuclear reactors in India.\xc2\xa0 This is a project that would create and sustain tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in the United States and in India.\xc2\xa0 So this is a good example of how smart decisions about renewable energy and fighting climate change can have an important and positive economic impact in the United States and in countries around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they near or still far away on finalizing a contract for those reactors?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that they have made important progress.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the exact status of that, but we\'ll see if we can get you a better update on that before the end of the day.</p>\n<p>\n\tRoberta.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President get a firm commitment from Prime Minister Modi to ratify the Paris agreement this year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I believe what Prime Minister Modi has said about this is that India shares the objective that the United States has laid out, which is to see the agreement come into force this year.\xc2\xa0 And India has committed to doing their part to working toward the goal, a shared goal, of entering the agreement this year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously each country has their own unique process for signing onto the deal, and I\'d refer you my Indian counterpart for an explanation of how that process works in India.\xc2\xa0 I did get a brief explanation of how it works, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I could explain it accurately here, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them do that.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than just the Prime Minister himself signing on the dotted line.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo they\xe2\x80\x99ll work through their process, but they are working through that process with an aim to complete it before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 And that would represent substantial progress in meeting the bar for what is required for the agreement to go into effect.\xc2\xa0 What is required is for 55 countries, representing 55 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s carbon emissions, signing onto the deal for it to go into effect.\xc2\xa0 And India I believe represents about 4 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s carbon emissions.\xc2\xa0 So getting them to sign onto the agreement this year would represent substantial progress toward that goal.\xc2\xa0 And if we\xe2\x80\x99re able to achieve that goal and if the agreement were to go into effect this year, that would be several years ahead of schedule, and I think would be a clear sign that leaders around the world have a sense of urgency about fighting climate change and fighting carbon pollution.\xc2\xa0 And it would be a welcome step in a positive direction for the health of the planet and the health of the people who live here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So without getting into the details of the Indian process, it sounds like there is some development or some advancement in terms of what the Prime Minister is able to tell the President, in terms of -- is that -- am I reading it correctly?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that that represents a more ambitious goal than India had previously laid out in terms of their timing of signing onto the agreement.\xc2\xa0 And so we obviously welcome that announcement from the Indian government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, is the President ready to endorse Secretary Clinton now that she seems to have enough delegates to secure the nomination?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there were a number of calculations that were conducted by media organizations throughout the day yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Those calculations included an updated survey of superdelegates across the country, and some media organizations have concluded that Secretary Clinton now has achieved a majority of delegates who will be voting at the Democratic Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, at this point, there is at least one superdelegate -- the one who works in the Oval Office -- who\xe2\x80\x99s not prepared to make a public declaration about his endorsement at this point.\xc2\xa0 But stay tuned and we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated.</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay.\xc2\xa0 Move around.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions for you.\xc2\xa0 So Congressman Lee Zeldin, who is a surrogate for Donald Trump, was on television earlier.\xc2\xa0 In his interview that he essentially accused the President of being racist.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- this seems to be some kind of coordinated attack from the Trump campaign, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have any kind of --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cCoordinated\xe2\x80\x9d is a generous description.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Loosely coordinated.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Most of the charges and countercharges of racism were lobbed by Republicans at Republicans, as far as I could tell this morning.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think in the discussion about the Democratic nomination process yesterday, I was sort of asked about whether or not the President was concerned about how the Democratic primary had lasted longer than expected.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that it did last longer than most people expected, as I acknowledged to Kevin.\xc2\xa0 But I think what\xe2\x80\x99s true is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got two Democratic candidates for President who have campaigned across the country on a platform that\xe2\x80\x99s quite similar.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had candidates both out there aggressively talking about the need to expand access to quality health care to more Americans; that health care is a right, not a privilege.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got Democratic candidates out there campaigning in favor of comprehensive, common-sense immigration reform that would have a positive impact on national security and on our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got Democrats out there campaigning to fight climate change, to implement the Iran deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve got both Democratic candidates articulating a strategy for growing our economy from the middle out, making the case that that\xe2\x80\x99s the most sustainable way to grow the American economy.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are out there on the campaign trail, advocating for a higher minimum wage for more support for education and job training to ensure that American workers are prepared to compete in a 21st century global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'ve got both candidates out there making a strong case for equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this has been a vigorous Democratic primary.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong case to be made that the Democratic Party is united around a core set of principles that I think will energize voters in the fall.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepublicans, on the other hand, wrapped up their nomination process early -- apparently it was early enough to allow the Republican Speaker of the House to basically call the Republican presidential nominee a racist and have the Republican governor of New Jersey try to defend him.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not really sure if that\'s the way they drew it up, but I do think it is a clear illustration of the cleavages within the Republican Party.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to those who are expressing concerns about their nominee\xe2\x80\x99s comments to explain why they continue to support him and vow to vote for him in the fall.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s a position I would struggle to defend, but I suspect they\xe2\x80\x99ll go ahead and try to do it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you seen Congressman Zeldin\xe2\x80\x99s comments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I heard a little bit about them, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they\'re worthy of a response from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue, the 9/11 Families wrote of letter to President Obama urging him to release these 28 classified pages, and DNI Clapper said that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that those pages could come out in June.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s now June.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update on the process there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update on the process.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard that the time frame has changed, so I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check with Director Clapper\xe2\x80\x99s office for an update on the timing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are another three weeks or so left in June.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t know if that timing has changed.\xc2\xa0 I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten an update on that recently.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, Congressman Hensarling put out a plan this morning that would dismantle some key parts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s --well, the Dodd-Frank law, including stripping some power from financial regulators.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you have a response to that proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no -- there should be no more confusion about which party is on the side of big banks and large financial interests on Wall Street, and the Democratic Party that\'s fighting for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 The President made this argument pretty directly in his Elkhart speech last week, which is that there are a variety of reasons that people could be casting a vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you\'re focused on the economy and focused on which party is actually fighting for the middle class, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty open-and-shut case.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats who are out there fighting for a higher minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Democrats who are out there fighting for Wall Street reform that did succeed in creating an independent watchdog for consumers that recovered $11 billion for 25 million families across the country who were cheated.\xc2\xa0 So these are reforms that essentially guarantee that taxpayers will not be on the hook for bailing out big banks if their risky bets go south.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut if you tear it down like House Republicans say that they want to do, that will allow big banks to go back to making risky bets and put taxpayers on the hook once again for bailing out those banks to prevent a second Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t make any sense.</p>\n<p>\n\tParticularly when you consider that Republican warnings about the impact that Wall Street reform would have on the economy were wrong.\xc2\xa0 Republicans suggested that regulations associated with Wall Street reform would choke off innovation in the economy.\xc2\xa0 They were wrong about that.\xc2\xa0 Our economy is the most durable in the world.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen important and sustained job growth and economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve also see sustained and rapid growth in the stock market itself.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard for Republicans to make a case that it is at all in our economic interest to tear down the reforms that have already done a lot to make our economy stronger and most stable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLalit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense on the thoughts between the Prime Minister and the President on the different positions between India and the U.S.?\xc2\xa0 And in that context, how did that decision see India and the U.S. can collaborate further in the region of the Indian Ocean?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that this question about coordinating our activities when it comes to national security and counterterrorism was an important part of the agenda today.\xc2\xa0 The President was certainly interested in looking for ways that the United States could deepen our coordination with India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tObviously the United States, under the leadership of President Obama, has placed a renewed focus on our strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific and in the Indian Ocean.\xc2\xa0 And I can tell you that there was important progress on finalizing agreements related to defense logistics, sharing of maritime information, and even the movement of U.S. aircraft carriers in the region.\xc2\xa0 We welcome that improved cooperation and coordination, and we believe it will have a material and positive impact on the national security of the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 And the two leaders agreed to have their staffs continue to work on efforts to deepen that cooperation even further.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President support India\xe2\x80\x99s membership to Nuclear Supply Group?\xc2\xa0 China is the only country which is publicly against India.\xc2\xa0 How does U.S. plan to overcome this challenge?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have to admit that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the details related to India\xe2\x80\x99s possible participation in that group. What I can tell you is that the United States has sought to extend and deepen our relationship when it comes to India\xe2\x80\x99s work in diversifying its sources of energy, and that includes building nuclear power plants by Westinghouse, a good American company.\xc2\xa0 We believe that would have positive impacts on the climate and a positive impact on the economy, both in the United States and in India.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFor overcoming any obstacles to completing and implementing that agreement, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the National Security Council.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get one of them to follow up with you for a more detailed answer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, do you have what they had at lunch?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did not -- well, as you guys may know, they actually -- when the President has a formal lunch in the Cabinet Room, the White House chefs, demonstrating their versatility and their ability to work under difficult circumstances, actually set up the table right outside my office by the stairwell.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So I was able to smell lunch as it was being prepared, but I did not actually see what was on the menu.\xc2\xa0 As I was walking out, they appeared to be preparing dessert.\xc2\xa0 It appeared to be some variation on a strawberry shortcake.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more details about what the salad and entr\xc3\xa9e course may have been.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you ask for a taste?\xc2\xa0 And were you refused?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was tempted to.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it would have been a little awkward if I had walked out here and had a little, like, whipped cream on the side of my mouth.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. process part of the climate change deal done?\xc2\xa0 Whatever the Indian process is -- is the U.S., whatever that -- what is that process and is it done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you about the United States\xe2\x80\x99 process is we have committed to completing it and implementing -- signing onto the deal before the end of this year.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe State Department is managing this process, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary Kerry who essentially will be running that process, so I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for an update on where that process stands.\xc2\xa0 But we have committed to completing that process before the end of this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a series of executive orders?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no congressional action required?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no congressional action that\xe2\x80\x99s required.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So essentially it\xe2\x80\x99s a series of executive orders that move this process along?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it requires any executive orders.\xc2\xa0 There may be some executive action required, but I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the State Department for implementation questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the New York trip tomorrow, the President is going to tape the Fallon show.\xc2\xa0 And when does the show air?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The show will actually air on Thursday evening.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re taping it one day in advance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a long period of time, like 20-some-odd hours.\xc2\xa0 Is there some reason for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 Well, I know this is something that your colleagues at NBC were interested in, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that, is there more -- is there some likelihood that the President will comment on the election -- the primary results tomorrow morning before he leaves?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible.\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s an update to the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because again, he had signaled some time ago that, in fact, things would be clearer, or better -- whatever the words were.\xc2\xa0 It just would seem unlikely that he would let this taping of this national show sit somewhere for that long a period of time having not commented on -- kept up with the news cycles.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just lastly, has he backed a superdelegate really? Or was he using a -- he is a superdelegate?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is the President actually is a superdelegate and will have a vote that he can cast at the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Vice President, too, or --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, yes.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I was actually just looking at this right before I walked out here.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that it\xe2\x80\x99s sitting Presidents and Vice Presidents and former Presidents and Vice Presidents who are Democrats are superdelegates to the Democratic Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tJames.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thank you.\xc2\xa0 Three subjects as quickly as possible.\xc2\xa0 On the visit of Prime Minister Modi, you stated earlier in this briefing that the commitment that the President secured from the Prime Minister was that the Prime Minister and the members of his team would do their part to try to achieve the goal of ratification through the Indian system by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Why did the President not secure from the Prime Minister a commitment that, in fact, the Prime Minister would get it done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 James, this goes to the thing that I was trying to describe to Roberta, which is there is a complicated procedure that the Indians have already begun to go about signing onto this agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I think the question is simply whether or not that procedure can be completed before the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Modi made a commitment that he was going to try to complete that procedure before the end of the year --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in his ability to deliver that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We saw the announcement earlier about Westinghouse proceeding with the construction of six nuclear reactors in India.\xc2\xa0 Presumably, the White House, in disclosing that fact, regarded it as good news.\xc2\xa0 Why does the White House not encourage Westinghouse to build six nuclear reactors in the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that there are one or two that are under construction here in the United States that are important to job creation here.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything that would dissuade us or anything that we would say that would discourage Westinghouse from considering similar, additional investments here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the campaign, you described in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing how \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d the President is -- your word -- at campaigning in general.\xc2\xa0 Is it the view of the President that his participation in the campaign, on the campaign trail is essential to a positive outcome for the Democratic Party in the fall?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard him describe it that way.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking is that when considering who should sit in the Oval Office for the next four years, the American people might be interested in the opinion of people who have previously sat at that desk.\xc2\xa0 And as I made reference to yesterday, at least those who are still living, none of them has indicated their support for the Republican presidential nominee at this point.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President does feel confident that whoever does emerge as the Democratic nominee, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have confidence in being able to advocate for that person\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, their values, their priorities, their approach to the job as something that is in the best interest of the country.\xc2\xa0 And I think that as somebody who has done the job for the last 7.5 years, the American people will be interested in his opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, I want to return, with some regret, to the subject of the controversy over the official White House transcript of the press briefing for May 9.\xc2\xa0 Just by way of recapping, the controversy relates the fact that my Fox News colleague, Kevin Corke, asked you whether you could say categorically that no senior administration official had ever lied publically about the Iran nuclear deal.\xc2\xa0 ABC News, Bloomberg News, Jason Chaffetz, many others, this reporter included, state, categorically, that the video shows, unmistakably, that you answered, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Kevin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, Mr. Corke gave you a second chance during that briefing to answer that question because the answer was so striking he thought you\xe2\x80\x99d misunderstood him.\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday that there was a little cross-talk that made this exchange inaudible.\xc2\xa0 The very transcript of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s briefing is studded with the word \xe2\x80\x9cinaudible\xe2\x80\x9d where it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate.\xc2\xa0 Why did the May 9 transcript not contain the word \xe2\x80\x9cinaudible?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 James, I don\xe2\x80\x99t write the transcripts.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have the staff --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You clear them for quality, though, I assume.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course I do, James.\xc2\xa0 Of course I do.\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the point.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite clear about exactly what our position on this has been.\xc2\xa0 The administration has worked very hard to present a forceful, fact-based, truthful case about the way that the United States and the rest of the international community benefits from Iran not obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is there are a lot of Republicans who opposed the deal who said a whole bunch of things about the Iran deal that were wrong.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they were mistaken; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they were na\xc3\xafve; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they were poorly briefed; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they were lying.\xc2\xa0 They were wrong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI leave it to them to defend exactly the position that they have taken, and I think I have presented factually, repeatedly, exactly the case that we have made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question was limited to the matter of the transcript and why, if you\xe2\x80\x99re asserting there was cross-talk that made something inaudible, the word \xe2\x80\x9cinaudible\xe2\x80\x9d didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear at the appropriate place?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final question on this.\xc2\xa0 Essentially, Josh, what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing is you\xe2\x80\x99re standing there at the podium and you\xe2\x80\x99re maintaining that you did not say that which it is plainly discernable you said, actually.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 James, I think what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that there have been three follow-ups now to this question and I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered it quite directly exactly what our position is.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99d like me to do it again, I can do it again.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the final question is, are you willing to review that video one more time, Josh, with an eye toward possibly amending it as it should be amended?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tMike.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Slightly more technical questions.\xc2\xa0 Today, Prime Minister Modi announced not a deal for the Westinghouse reactors, but a pledge to get a deal.\xc2\xa0 Are you disappointed, is the administration disappointed that when the Prime Minister comes he can\'t announce an actual contract on these things?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, Mike.\xc2\xa0 I think that the visit from the Prime Minister of India is one that we looked forward to, and we certainly were pleased with the opportunity that the two leaders had to sit down and discuss some important issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On this particular issue, though, are you disappointed that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to announce a contract today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As my colleague from India mentioned, it now looks likely that India will not be admitted to the Nuclear Supply Group because of some countries\xe2\x80\x99 objections.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration disappointed that India won\xe2\x80\x99t be admitted to the Nuclear Supply Group?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mike, I have to tell you that, as I had mentioned to Lalit, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with the details of this particular dispute, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have somebody follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The fiduciary rule legislation --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The conflict of interest rule?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, that one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- has been passed by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 You guys have indicated in the past you\'re opposed to it.\xc2\xa0 Will you veto it?\xc2\xa0 When will you veto it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, to be clear, what Congress did was they actually voted to overturn an executive action that would prevent investment advisors from acting in a way inconsistent with the best interests of their customers.\xc2\xa0 That kind of behavior has actually cost, on average, $17 billion a year in retirement savings for hardworking Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President just believes it\xe2\x80\x99s common sense that if you sign up with an investment advisor to help you plan for your retirement that that individual should have your own best financial interests at heart.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news is, is that most of them do.\xc2\xa0 Most of the retirement -- people out there who are offering retirement advice do keep their customers\xe2\x80\x99 best interests at heart.\xc2\xa0 And this rule basically doesn\'t have any impact on the way that they do business.\xc2\xa0 The only people who are affected by this rule are people who sign up clients but don\'t make a commitment to acting in that client\xe2\x80\x99s best interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to Republicans to explain who they claim to be on the side of middle-class families, except when it comes to their planning for retirement, in which case they\'re with the large financial corporations who are already making billions of dollars a year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why the President is going to veto the bill, because he believes that this executive action is important to providing more middle-class families access to a dignified and secure retirement.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know exactly when the President will sign that bill, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure and let you know exactly when he\xe2\x80\x99ll veto the bill.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be sure and let you know exactly when he does it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lastly, the Speaker of the House today described Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the judge in his civil case as a \xe2\x80\x9ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that characterization?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0As I mentioned yesterday, I don\'t anticipate at this point that we\'ll weigh in on all the controversial comments that are uttered by the Republican nominee for president.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you tell us a little bit about this phone call that the President had with Senator Sanders this weekend, and whether or not the discussion of an endorsement came up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any private conversations to discuss at this point.\xc2\xa0 The lines of communication between the White House and the campaigns have been open throughout the campaigns -- throughout the nomination process.\xc2\xa0 And I think that should be evident by the fact that both candidates have been to the White House for a private meeting with the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any details about any private conversations that have occurred lately.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there a pairing with that phone call?\xc2\xa0 I mean, did Secretary Clinton also receive one?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any details of private conversations with either Democratic presidential candidates to share at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or even just the fact that one happened, not details of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you look at some of the comments that were made this morning by Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker was saying that time is of the essence here for getting the Democratic Party to rally and coalesce.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree, does the President agree that time is ticking here, that there needs to be unity soon?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that we are nearing the end of the nomination process and that Democrats all across the country had an opportunity to weigh in on the decision about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election.\xc2\xa0 And this is a process that has been energizing to millions of Democratic voters across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been a really good thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as the process winds down it will be important for the Democratic Party to come together in support of the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly intends to make his voice heard in encouraging Democrats to come together behind whoever wins.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President see himself as a unifier?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is that the role that you\'re kind of describing here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, when you take a look at some of the public opinion data about the President\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the Democratic Party, he certainly would be well positioned to play that role.\xc2\xa0 And given how important he thinks this election is, and given how important Democratic unity will be in the general election, yes, I think you could expect the President to play that kind of role.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve said that the superdelegate who lives here isn\'t ready to endorse just yet.\xc2\xa0 But as you said, many news organizations, mine included, have done the homework, done the math and see that Hillary Clinton has enough delegates.\xc2\xa0 At least on the question of the symbolism, as someone who\xe2\x80\x99s gotten enough votes here be the first woman to lead a major party, that\'s historic.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction or a comment to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Not at this point.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that primarily is that even as we speak right now there are Democrats in six different states that are out there casting a ballot, making their voice heard on this process.\xc2\xa0 And just out of respect for their role in this process, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to withhold comment until they\xe2\x80\x99ve had an opportunity to participate.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll try again tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a promise, tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But try again tomorrow -- at least as it relates to me expressing the President\xe2\x80\x99s point of view.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we be hearing from you tomorrow, if not the President, on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is traveling to New York, and I do expect to gaggle with the traveling press pool on the plane.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAndrew.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 This morning, Assad addressed parliament and again said that he has absolutely no intention of leaving office.\xc2\xa0 I was wondering where you think that leaves the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t think it represents a change in his position, and I don\'t think it represents a change in mine.\xc2\xa0 President Assad has lost the legitimacy to lead that country.\xc2\xa0 He continues to carry out heinous acts of violence against his own people.\xc2\xa0 He continues to order the military to do things like drop barrel bombs against innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that the Assad regime is engaged in repeated efforts to obstruct the delivery of humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of Syrians that are suffering.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\'s why it\'s impossible for him to fulfill his rhetoric about uniting that country under his leadership.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not going to happen.\xc2\xa0 In fact, his continued presence in that office and in that job only exacerbates the chaos and turmoil and violence in that country.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s time for him to leave so that the rest of the international community can support the Syrian people as they choose the political direction of that country from here.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been our position for quite some time, and there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing about Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s speech that\'s changed it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve been pressing Russia for the better part of five years to use their influence with Assad to get him to step down.\xc2\xa0 Is it your assessment the Vladimir Putin is unwilling or unable to influence Assad?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you probably have to ask him exactly what his view of President Assad is.\xc2\xa0 I think what is true is that -- and I think this is relevant -- what President Putin himself has said is that a political transition in Syria is necessary to bring the turmoil and violence inside that country to an end.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s clearly in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s interest to try to bring about this transition.\xc2\xa0 President Putin has said as much.\xc2\xa0 So the question is, what is he prepared to do to use that influence to bring about that outcome that he believes is in the best interest of his country.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to urge him to urge him to take those necessary steps, but ultimately it\'s up to President Putin.</p>\n<p>\n\tI would note that particularly when it comes to the Cessation of Hostilities, that President Putin didn\xe2\x80\x99t just state as an affirmative fact -- let me say it this way -- it\'s not just an affirmative fact that Russia has influence with the Assad regime in Syria, it\'s in the context of the cessation of hostilities, President Putin made a commitment to use that influence to get the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And in the last few weeks we have seen a concerning pattern of violations of that cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we continue to urge the Russian government to live up to the commitment that they made to use that influence to get the Assad regime to abide by the cessation of hostilities.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While this diplomatic stalemate continues the humanitarian situation in Syria goes from bad to worse.\xc2\xa0 The U.N. has kind of u-turned on the need for aircrafts for aid.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that U.S. airdrops are -- unilaterally?\xc2\xa0 Are they something that you\xe2\x80\x99d consider?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\'t have details about what other options the United States might be considering.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we are deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 In the last week we have seen some aid organizations, including the United Nations, the Syrian Red Crescent, and the ICRC, succeed in delivering some humanitarian assistance to a couple of communities that were in critical need of support.\xc2\xa0 But there are other deliveries that were blocked and prevented.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOur concern is that there are hundreds of thousands at least that are suffering.\xc2\xa0 The most effective way to bring them relief is essentially delivering these supplies on the ground.\xc2\xa0 And in too many instances, we\'re seeing the Assad regime prevent that from happening.\xc2\xa0 In other cases, it\'s just violence on the ground that\'s preventing that from happening.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we continue to be deeply concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 I know that members of the United Nations Security Council had an opportunity last week to meet to discuss what could be done to try to address this situation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the United States is an active participant in those discussions.\xc2\xa0 It continues to be true, as has been the case over the last several years, that the United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to try to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Syrian population.\xc2\xa0 And the United States will continue to offer that support.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just -- if you could indulge me with just one more question.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the issue of the fact there was no press conference between Prime Minister Modi and the President, it just seems a little odd that two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracies -- the leaders of two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracies wouldn\'t be able to find time to come out and answer questions about their meeting.\xc2\xa0 Was that a problem of -- did you actually ask the Indian delegation if they would be willing to hold a press conference and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible because of them?\xc2\xa0 Or what was the issue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I think the issue was just a matter of scheduling.\xc2\xa0 And between the private engagements that the President and the Prime Minister had both in the Oval Office and over lunch, that there was time for the two leaders to speak to the professional, independent journalists that cover the White House and that cover the Indian Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 But there was not time on the schedule for the two leaders to take questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that Hillary Clinton does have that magic number of delegates and she\xe2\x80\x99s being called the presumptive nominee, is that how the White House is viewing the situation now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right now the White House views the situation as ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Democratic voters in six states are at the polls even as we speak casting a ballot and making their voice heard about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election.\xc2\xa0 And out of respect for that ongoing process, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to declare a winner from here.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let these votes be counted; we\xe2\x80\x99ll let these voices be heard.\xc2\xa0 And then I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ll know a little bit more about the outcomes of the race at that point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, with that number of delegates already in her pocket, what is really going to change?\xc2\xa0 And since she\xe2\x80\x99s being called the presumptive nominee at this point, are you not -- you\'re not calling her that, is that right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 No one at the White House has labeled either candidate the presumptive nominee at this point.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we\'re interested in the results tonight.\xc2\xa0 We are interested in making sure that voters across the country can make their voices heard.\xc2\xa0 The President said as much last week.\xc2\xa0 And it certainly is possible that we\xe2\x80\x99ll know quite a bit more about what the likely outcome is going to be after the voters are tallied tonight.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut out of respect for those who are casting ballots right now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hold the position that we\'ve held for several months now, which is to be fair and neutral and give the Democratic voters across the country the opportunity to make this decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that\'s the only thing the President is waiting for before he officially endorses Hillary Clinton is to let the votes be cast?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible then that he will make a statement on this in some form as early as tonight?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I can just -- as you\'re all trying to plan your evenings, I I can tell you that I do not anticipate the President making a public appearance to discuss politics tonight. But if there are any updates, we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.\xc2\xa0 But you don\'t have to worry about the President making an appearance.\xc2\xa0 None is planned at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And virtually every time the President speaks publicly now he\xe2\x80\x99s criticizing Donald Trump, sometimes without mentioning his name, but he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten general, he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten very specific about certain things that Donald Trump has said.\xc2\xa0 So based on the things that Donald Trump has said most recently, is the White House considering those words to be racist?\xc2\xa0 Or since the President tends to speak more generally, given I guess the body of statements that are out there by the candidate, does the President consider Donald Trump to be a racist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the President has used that specific word, but -- look, I think what is true is that, first of all, the President -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual for the President to make comments that have nothing to do with the presidential race and don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do with either of the presidential nominees.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President did just that a couple of hours ago in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is, there is a tendency on the part of some observers to assume that every time the President makes a comment affirming a core Democratic or even American value, that that is perceived somehow as a shot at the presumptive Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 And I think that says much more about the language that is used by the presumptive Republican nominee than it does about the values that are championed by the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me also say that -- and this is part of the case I was making to James about the role that the President will have in the general election -- regardless of who the Democratic nominee is, the President is an important validator.\xc2\xa0 The President is somebody who has been doing this job for the last seven and a half years.\xc2\xa0 And I think it will be relevant to the decision-making of many Americans -- not just Democrats, by the way, but some independents and some Republicans -- who will be interested to hear what the President thinks about which candidate has the judgment, the temperament, the maturity, the decision-making skills to advance U.S. interests around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen the American people see footage of the President, for example, as he did today, meeting with the Prime Minister of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest democracy, the American people want to make sure that our interests and our country are being well represented.\xc2\xa0 It matters who is sitting in that chair across from the Indian Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 That has significant consequences for our economy, for our planet, for our national security, for our alliances in that region and around the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I would anticipate that over the course of the general election, the President will be making the case about how important that leadership and that symbolism is, and why he believes that the Democratic nominee is best suited to fill that job.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But both the President and you yourself have used a lot of adjectives to describe Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s words in the past, including things like \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdivisive.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Now that you have top Republicans using the word \xe2\x80\x9cracist\xe2\x80\x9d to describe some very specific things that were said, is there a reason why you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that -- unless you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that those words are racist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess I would -- one might observe that maybe -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to take the bait every time that the presumptive Republican nominee says something controversial.\xc2\xa0 In this case, there are plenty of voices that are being heard.\xc2\xa0 And I guess what I would say is that I suspect the President\xe2\x80\x99s concerns aren\xe2\x80\x99t altogether different than some of the concerns that may be raised by Republicans.\xc2\xa0 A rare moment of bipartisan unity maybe.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been interesting over the past couple of days to hear the First Lady get into a little bit of politics in her commencement speech, or -- even though that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really the first time she\xe2\x80\x99s been critical of what is assumed to be things Donald Trump has said.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to see the First Lady on the campaign trail and getting involved, just as you described the President as a very popular unifier?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- the First Lady at this point does not have any campaign events on the books, but she certainly is somebody who is passionate about the future of this country.\xc2\xa0 She is somebody who is passionate about progressive values.\xc2\xa0 She certainly is somebody who is passionate about making sure that our veterans and our military families are taken care of, and that the commitments that our country makes to them are kept.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe First Lady is certainly passionate about health care issues and ensuring the health of the next generation of Americans.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s also somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s passionate about civil rights and equality and fairness and justice.\xc2\xa0 And her commitment to those values and her commitment to those priorities have contributed to her large following across the country.\xc2\xa0 There are Democrats and some independents and some Republicans who deeply respect the First Lady.\xc2\xa0 And I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out that at some point she may express a preference in the election, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tSarah.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Given what you said about the President wanting to let the process play out, let Democrats\' voices be heard, D.C.\'s primary is on June 14th.\xc2\xa0 Does he feel that the Democrats of the District of Columbia need to have the opportunity to weigh in before he does?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President would certainly expect and encourage Democrats in the District of Columbia to participate in that election and to make their voices heard, as well.\xc2\xa0 But what I also said yesterday is that once somebody has definitively demonstrated that they\'ve got a majority of delegates who will be voting in the convention, that person will have a strong case to make as the presumptive Republican nominee -- the Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, at this point, out of respect for people who are casting ballots right now, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a winner to declare.\xc2\xa0 But the President is going to continue to watch this process moving forward, and we\'ll keep you updated if he\'s got some comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\'s the difference?\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve been saying, there\'s sort of a mathematical case to be made that the Democrats have a presumptive nominee at this point.\xc2\xa0 There might be a stronger mathematical case.\xc2\xa0 But if we\'re kind of just talking about the idea that people need to get to weigh in before the President does, what\'s the difference between the votes happening today and the votes happening next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think part of the difference is that the votes are taking place right now, as we speak.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President has got deep respect for the process and for the people who are taking their lunch break or otherwise making time in their day to participate in the Democratic primary in their state.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good thing and that is certainly something that the President respects and encourages people to do to get engaged.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut look, we\'ll take a look at the tallies and we\'ll keep you posted.</p>\n<p>\n\tDave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask you about this case at Stanford, where the young male student was sentenced to six months in the county lockup for a sexual assault on some young woman.\xc2\xa0 I wonder is the President -- obviously the President has been very involved in violence issues on campus, sexual assaults on campus. Obviously, he\'s the father of two daughters.\xc2\xa0 I was just wondering if he\'s expressed an opinion about the propriety of the sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the -- I\'m confident that the President is aware of this particular issue, given the widespread media coverage of it.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him weigh in with an opinion one way or the other, so I can\'t speak to his views on this particular case.\xc2\xa0 But the President certainly has spoken many times, powerfully, about his views on this particular issue. The President believes strongly that sexual assault is wrong, that there\'s no place for it in our military, there\'s no place for it on college campuses, there\'s no place for it in our society.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President and the Vice President have played a leading role in the "It\'s On Us" campaign to not just speak out against the scourge of sexual assault, but also to encourage men and women across the country to *[not] shirk from their responsibility, to intervene when the risk of sexual assault is heightened; that it\'s on us, as Americans, as active members of our community, to protect one another and to look out for one another, and, where necessary, to intervene to stop a sexual assault.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President feels quite strongly about this.\xc2\xa0 This is a priority of his.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that this is at least partially informed by the fact that he has two daughters, but I\'m confident that the President would feel strongly about this issue even if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 This is a case of right and wrong.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s one that the President feels strongly about.\xc2\xa0 And given the media attention that this issue has gotten, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if at some point the President does weigh in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a view on whether the judge should be removed from office?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no position that the White House has taken on that particular matter.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are people who have been quite outspoken in raising their concerns about the particular judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to weigh in on the details of an individual case.</p>\n<p>\n\tByron.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about this argument from Senator Sanders and his campaign that the superdelegates do not vote until the convention, and therefore it is premature to declare a winner?\xc2\xa0 Does the President agree with that?\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like you\'re saying that he may have something to say on this race in the coming days or tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, it sounds like he\xe2\x80\x99s rejecting that argument.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Byron, I mean, in some ways, the President does have an established track record here.\xc2\xa0 Many of you will recall in 2008 that then-Senator Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign went to great lengths to highlight the support of superdelegates for his campaign.\xc2\xa0 And one of the reasons for that is that we saw that a number of superdelegates were switching affiliation between one candidate to support the Obama campaign, and that was important to building support and momentum behind President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that dynamic really at play in this most recent election; that there have been superdelegates that have weighed in on both sides, but there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a lot of changing of affiliation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, look, Senator Sanders and his campaign are certainly entitled to make whatever argument that they would like.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would note that this is a pretty stark contrast to the Republican nomination contest, in which there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of dispute about the rules.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Sanders understands the role that superdelegates play; Secretary Clinton understands the role that superdelegates play in choosing the Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0 They understood the rules when they signed up, and they\xe2\x80\x99re playing by them now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd to the credit of both candidates, they\xe2\x80\x99ve understood the rules and they have worked hard, and both of them have succeeded in building a substantial following and winning a lot of support at the convention.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the aggressive campaigns that have been waged, and the success that both Democrats have experienced in building strong, energetic support for their candidacies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking beyond this current race, it seems like Senator Sanders and many of his supporters are going to push for sort of long-term reforms to the nominating process.\xc2\xa0 It sounds like they\xe2\x80\x99re pushing for more open primaries, a kind of reduced or perhaps eliminated role for superdelegates.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have a position on either of those reforms?\xc2\xa0 Would he like to see more open primaries or the end of superdelegates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think every four or eight years there is a discussion within the party about what I think everyone would acknowledge is a rather complicated process for choosing a party nominee.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes that devolves into a discussion about the benefits and consequences of superdelegates. Sometimes the discussion will veer into territory of the wisdom of allowing states like Iowa, New Hampshire to enjoy their traditional special status.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI speak with some personal experience on this.\xc2\xa0 Back in 2004, when I worked at the DNC, there was a -- this was at the end of 2003 and early 2004 -- there was a careful review of the process for appointing or selecting a Democratic nominee at that point.\xc2\xa0 And there was a vigorous discussion about how the process -- the primary process could be changed to ensure that more Democratic voters and more states had an opportunity to weigh in, in the process of choosing a Democratic nominee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat was something that was important in 2004, but that was less of a concern in 2016 because we saw this primary campaign extend to so many different states.\xc2\xa0 And we saw in 2008 that that actually ended up benefitting the Democratic candidate in the general election.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo these kinds of discussions are part of the process just about every four or eight years.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the DNC, which has a responsibility to administer that process, will listen to the ideas and suggestions of Democrats all across the country and make a decision about whether or not the process needs to be reformed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve been saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s been good for the country and for the party to have two Democratic nominees who have been having a vigorous debate.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve described this as a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 But would it be good for the party and the country to have a contested convention scenario, or does the President feel as if the party should have a firm nominee who is not being contested heading into the convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say as a general matter -- I don\'t have any update on timing -- but I will just say as general matter that the President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Democrats to come together at the close of the nomination process to strongly support the Democratic nominee, because the stakes in the general election are very high, and because Democratic voters, despite their differences, in some cases, over which candidate would better represent the Democratic Party in the general election, the truth is both candidates are fighting for the same kinds of things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBoth candidates are fighting for expanded access to health care.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting for immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting to address climate change.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting in support of implementing the Iran deal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting for strategies that expand economic opportunity for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting for equal pay for equal work.\xc2\xa0 Both candidates are fighting to enhance education and job training in this country because they understand that we need to train the next generation of American workers to compete and win in a 21st century global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard for Democratic voters across the country to support a candidate that\'s been running on the same kind of platform, even if the candidate they voted for in the primary didn\'t win.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you said the close of the nominating process, you mean the end of the primaries and the end of the voting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m being intentionally vague.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That happens.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does happen.\xc2\xa0 It does happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tKaren.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a follow-up on the Stanford case.\xc2\xa0 Given how high profile the White House has been on this -- as you said, and you went through all of that -- without getting into the specifics of this case, is there a concern, though, when there are light sentences like this -- because that\'s sparking the outrage -- that that sends a message to perpetrators of sexual assaults and victims of sexual assaults?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want my comments to be interpreted as weighing in on this particular case.\xc2\xa0 There are plenty of people on the outside who are weighing in on the case. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that from here.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I will just tell you is that the President -- and in this case, I feel confident in speaking for the Vice President -- that both of them view sexual assault as a scourge.\xc2\xa0 Sexual assault has no place on our college campuses.\xc2\xa0 It has no place in our military.\xc2\xa0 It has no place in our society.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Vice President, in particular, has been a leading advocate of combatting violence against women.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President authored a bill called the Violence Against Women Act that would ramp up funding and resources for law enforcement organizations to combat that kind of violence and sexual assault in our communities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President and the Vice President certainly think this is a high priority, and that a very clear, unambiguous message should be sent that sexual assault and sexual harassment and violence against women will not be tolerated in any way, shape, or form in this country.\xc2\xa0 And they feel strongly about that -- both as a moral issue, but also as a law enforcement issue, as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I suspect that given the amount of media attention that this particular case has generated that the President may choose to weigh in one way or another at some point -- likely in response to a question.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about the individual case.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to this question about whether or not sexual assault is a serious problem, I think our country needs to unequivocally make it clear that sexual assault is not something that will be tolerated in our society.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he have something planned where he might comment in response to a question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that he does.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t want to send any mixed signals here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no plan for the President to weigh in on this.\xc2\xa0 But I suspect that at the next opportunity where the President does take questions, that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if one of you asks and the President has a thoughtful answer to share.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just on a local issue.\xc2\xa0 The D.C. City Council approved an increase to the minimum wage to $15 an hour today.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier how the Democratic candidates have been pushing for that.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan was asked about it, and he said it would \xe2\x80\x9cdo more harm than good.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is there a White House reaction to the D.C. vote today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details on the D.C. bill.\xc2\xa0 The President has long been advocating for national legislation that would increase the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The minimum wage hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been increased I believe in coming up on nine years now.\xc2\xa0 That\'s too long for hardworking Americans to go without getting a raise. And the fact is right now if you are an individual working full-time making minimum wage and you\'re trying to raise a family of four, you\xe2\x80\x99re raising that family of four below the poverty line.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo for somebody who -- for Republicans who claim that they believe that there should be a strong linkage between hard work and the ability to raise a family, you would think that if Republicans were actually committed to that principle, that they would support raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 But for some reason, they keep blocking it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I will leave it to them to try to come up with a rational, legitimate, intuitive explanation for why that is.\xc2\xa0 Right now, it just looks like, to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s paying attention, that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing the bidding of big business and they\xe2\x80\x99re not concerned about the impact on working people.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it looks.\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s not the way it is, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for them to clarify.\xc2\xa0 But to anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s paying attention that sure is the way that it looks.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal.\xc2\xa0 Seems like a good day to call on you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know the President was eagerly engaged on an issue that you\xe2\x80\x99re quite interested in, so let\xe2\x80\x99s discuss it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Two questions quickly.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Modi and President Obama met several times in Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s two-year term, and they call each other friends. They got so close and deep relations, I believe in these two years, and also making trips -- the Prime Minister was here in the U.S. four times, and the President went twice in India.</p>\n<p>\n\tMy question is that -- how does President compares Prime Minister Modi with other global leaders that he meets hundreds of times in this White House?\xc2\xa0 And if Prime Minister Modi has invited him to the Taj Mahal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that I think what makes the relationship between Prime Minister Modi and President Obama so strong is the shared commitment that they have to warm relations between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 Both leaders recognize that a strong relationship between the United States and India benefits the economy, the national security and the people of the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is what animates their relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President obviously has had an opportunity to spend time socially with Prime Minister Modi.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister Modi, as I recall, hosted a very nice state dinner for President Obama in India on Republic Day, when the President was there last year.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, the President was not able to visit the Taj Mahal on that trip, but the President is certainly looking forward to having an opportunity to visit the Taj Mahal at some point after leaving the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, India and U.S. made history yesterday -- for the first time, that -- over 200 -- after thousands of years of old items stolen or smuggled out of India, and they were presented or given under the leadership of President Obama and Attorney General yesterday to the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 What you would call artifacts.\xc2\xa0 So what do you think -- how the President thinks about this, that those items being stolen every day from India?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd also, at the same time, before coming to the U.S., the Prime Minister was in Switzerland and he was talking there with the Swiss President about stolen money from India by corrupt politicians or -- called black market money.\xc2\xa0 If the President of U.S. is going to help India, just like they helped to bring these artifacts out -- so that black market money sitting -- millions of dollars out of India.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any details.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the conversations that you referenced there with the Swiss.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that I think what is evident in the conversations and the readout of the conversations that you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard today is that the President is committed to strengthening the relationship between the United States and India.\xc2\xa0 And we want to look for every opportunity we can to remove impediments in that important relationship, because the world and surely the citizens of our two countries benefit from a stronger relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to deepen our cooperation on economic issues, on national security issues, on fighting terrorism, on fighting climate change.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of ways in which the United States and India can work together to improve the world for the citizens in our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama has made this relationship a priority.\xc2\xa0 In fact, President Obama was interested in strengthening U.S. ties with India even before Prime Minister Modi took office.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that the very first state dinner that Prime Minister -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, that President Obama and the First Lady hosted here at the White House was to host Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And that was an important event, and I think it was an important symbol about the priority that the President places on the U.S. relationship with India.\xc2\xa0 And the President is pleased that he has found a partner in Prime Minister Modi to extend and strengthen that relationship.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to just clarify one thing quickly.\xc2\xa0 Prime Minister thanked Attorney General about the over 200 artifacts presented to India.\xc2\xa0 And he said that more relations -- strengthening relations on this because Indians -- 1 billion Indians in India -- also they put on Facebook that this is a great relationship between two countries that items are being returned by the United States.\xc2\xa0 And the U.S. helped India to get those items.\xc2\xa0 And also, at the same time, those Panama Papers, among others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Goyal, I mean, just as it relates to the specific artifacts, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that particular issue.\xc2\xa0 But obviously President Obama believes in the importance of a strong relationship between the United States and India, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity for us to remove impediments or irritants in that relationship, then we certainly want to take advantage of the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You have some experience working for an historic candidate for President.\xc2\xa0 You know the feeling that supporters had back in 2008 when President Obama became the presumptive nominee, when he became ultimately the nominee for the Democratic Party, becoming the first African-American major-party candidate to run and be the nominee for the parties of the presidency.\xc2\xa0 Can you get a sense about what supporters of Hillary Clinton are feeling right now, with some news organizations saying that she is now the presumptive nominee for her party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, listen, Secretary Clinton\'s candidacy was historic back in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And the President deeply respected the challenges that she encountered and overcame in running that campaign.\xc2\xa0 It was a campaign in which she got 18 million votes to be the Democratic nominee for President -- a remarkable achievement in 2008.\xc2\xa0 And she set out to pick up where she left off, and that process is coming to an end.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think what I can say at this point is that one of the things that was important to President Obama was that the country could be quite proud of the symbolic progress that we have made by nominating and then electing and then reelecting an African-American to serve as President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 That represents tremendous progress in our country.\xc2\xa0 And the President has observed many times that he owes a deep debt of gratitude to civil rights activists of all faiths and all races who fought hard for the progress that our country has made, and he\'s a beneficiary of that hard work and of the sacrifices that they made.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\'s a similar story to tell about the progress that our country has made when it comes to the rights of women.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a similar story to tell about how even Secretary Clinton\'s candidacy for the Democratic nomination is a reflection of how much progress our country has made and how she has benefitted from the commitment and sacrifice made by previous generations of Americans -- men and women, black, white, Hispanic.\xc2\xa0 And I think she will at some point speak much more powerfully and cogently than I can about how she is a beneficiary of that work and inheritor of that legacy.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s something that she\'ll, I\'m sure, discuss more once this nomination process has come to a conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
