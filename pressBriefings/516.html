AST</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 My colleague will go ahead and give a readout of the meeting, and then we\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 The President had an excellent, more than two-hour meeting with King Abdullah.\xc2\xa0 And it was really an opportunity for the President to sit down face-to-face with the King and, more than anything, do two things:\xc2\xa0 One is underscore the importance of the bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the other was to talk about some of the key regional issues that affect both of our interests so profoundly.</p>\n<p class="p2">The President underscored how much he values the strategic relationship.\xc2\xa0 The United States has had an important relationship with Saudi Arabia for decades on security, energy, economics, and regional security issues.\xc2\xa0 And the President wanted to make clear that he believes that continues to be the case.</p>\n<p class="p2">There\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes a perception out there of differences between the United States and Saudi Arabia, and the two leaders spoke frankly about a number of issues and what might be or might have been tactical differences or differences in approaching some of these issues, but they stressed, and President Obama made very clear that he believes that our strategic interests remain very much aligned.</p>\n<p class="p3">When you think about our commitments to the region and to Saudi Arabia, that we are committed to defending our friends and allies in the region from external aggression, our agenda puts nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction high on the list. Countering terrorism in the region and ensuring the secure flow of energy out of the region -- those are core American interests and they\xe2\x80\x99re very much aligned with Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s interests.\xc2\xa0 And it was, again, an excellent chance for the President to sit down face-to-face with the King and talk about that.</p>\n<p class="p2">They also, as I mentioned, discussed regional security and political issues -- a wide number of them, but maybe I\'ll focus primarily on Iran and Syria, which they spent significant time on.\xc2\xa0 And once again, it was a good opportunity for the President, on Iran, to underscore what we are doing in the nuclear negotiations, what our objectives are, and to make clear to the King -- and via the King, Saudi Arabia -- that we\'re determined to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon; that we\'ve gone into the talks eyes wide open, but we believe that this is a common interest in stopping proliferation to Iran; that the arrangements in place now have halted Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program and set it back in important respects, which gives us time to negotiate in the P5-plus-1 to reach a comprehensive solution that meets the criteria that I mentioned, of stopping Iran from having a weapon, and ensuring that its program is exclusively peaceful; and again, to sit down with the King and assure him that that\'s the objective, that we won\'t accept a bad deal; and that the focus on the nuclear issue doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we are not concerned about or very much focused on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other destabilizing activities in the region, which the Saudis and the King are also concerned about.\xc2\xa0 Iran\xe2\x80\x99s meddling in other countries in the region, its support for terrorism -- these are things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear across the board that will not go away, but we believe, and the President was able to explain that dealing with the nuclear issue doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean not focus on those things, and stopping Iran from a nuclear weapon itself will curb Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ability to continue its destabilizing activities throughout the region.</p>\n<p class="p2">Now, one of the destabilizing activities Iran is undertaking in the region, we believe, is its support for the Assad regime in Syria, which is another big topic between the two leaders.\xc2\xa0 As I think you all know, King Abdullah feels very passionately about Syria and the tragic humanitarian situation there, as obviously does President Obama -- and once again, an opportunity to sit down face-to-face.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually cooperated well and extensively with the Saudis on the question of Syria.\xc2\xa0 We share the objective of bringing about a political transition.\xc2\xa0 We share the objective of supporting the moderate opposition and isolating extremists and terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And we not only share objectives, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working together very well and increasing our cooperation, which I think is, indeed, getting better and better.</p>\n<p class="p2">So it was an opportunity not only to underscore that we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get to the same place, but some of the ways that we are doing it.</p>\n<p class="p2">They discussed a number of other topics as well, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll just end with the -- getting back to the core point that I stressed at the start -- the President has been in touch with the King numerous times through meetings, phone calls, exchanges of information, and obviously dialogue among senior officials.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like a face-to-face meeting, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it was a priority for the President to actually come here.\xc2\xa0 The King was very gracious; hosted him for, like I said, a good, long meeting.\xc2\xa0 And I think it just underscores the importance we, at least, place on this relationship.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the degree to which the King and the President discussed in specifics MPADS through Saudi to the Syrian rebels?\xc2\xa0 And can you be as declarative as possible as to whether or not the administration is revisiting that issue and is now more open to it than, say, it was a couple of months ago?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start with the latter and try to be as declarative as possible that our approach on that issue hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 Without getting into the specifics of how we feel about this or that weapons system, or different types of assistance that may be provided to the opposition, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us before in a number of different contexts explain concerns about certain types of weapons systems that could be part of a proliferation that would not serve our interest.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed that, and those concerns haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.</p>\n<p class="p2">Where the meeting is concerned -- again, without getting into the details of what they discussed -- this was not a trip or a meeting designed to coordinate detailed questions of types of assistance to the Syrians --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was not?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to do what his senior officials do and intelligence and military channels do.\xc2\xa0 He came here to do the strategic discussion that I underscored about our objectives and our commitments.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as a follow-up, did the King bring that up -- the MPADS and giving more assistance to the Syrian rebels?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a technical, detailed discussion of types of weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, what did the King -- did the King seem convinced of what the President said about Iran -- the nuclear deal?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak for the King or his reaction.\xc2\xa0 He listened very carefully.\xc2\xa0 And like I said, what was important about this meeting is obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve explained to the Saudis, they know what our position is, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing like the person who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for driving and making this policy to come down and sit face-to-face with the King and patiently and carefully walk him through what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing and what the objective is.</p>\n<p class="p2">And I think -- again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak for the King\xe2\x80\x99s -- what he took away or his response.\xc2\xa0 But I think it was important to have the chance to look him in the eyes and explain how determined the President is to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and how determined the President is to continue to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other destabilizing activities, and that the President and the United States are going into this eyes wide open, there\xe2\x80\x99s no na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The decision on MPADS aside, has your view of the opposition evolved over time?\xc2\xa0 Do you see elements of the opposition that are in better position or are more trustworthy?\xc2\xa0 And did the King identify the kinds of opposition factions that would be of help?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say a few things and then my colleague may want to add.\xc2\xa0 I think that it is the \xc2\xa0case that over time we have been able to develop deeper relationships with the opposition.\xc2\xa0 Part of that simply comes with the fact of providing assistance.\xc2\xa0 You build relationships when you are working with people.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve also sought to bring together and harmonize the approaches of different countries in the region -- so the United States and Saudi Arabia, but also other Gulf countries, other European allies -- with the objective being strengthening the moderate opposition, but also providing assistance in a way that is complementary, so the sum is greater than the parts in terms of how we are able to strengthen the opposition as a political and military entity.</p>\n<p class="p2">So these are relationships that have been built up over the course of the last year or two as our assistance relationship has continued.\xc2\xa0 We have confidence in the moderate opposition in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, the emergence of some more extremist elements within the opposition I think only reinforces the need to strengthen, again, a more moderate opposition as a counterweight both to Assad, of course, and also to those extremist elements.</p>\n<p class="p2">But I don\'t know if you want to characterize.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, just maybe on the coordination piece.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not just a question of amounts of assistance that go to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 But one of the things we\'ve stressed and tried over time to do is coordinate better with our partners.\xc2\xa0 Because everybody knows there are a lot of different opposition groups in Syria -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not always on the same page working together, and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be effective -- at least we can effectively coordinate our opposition and try to lead them in the same direction.</p>\n<p class="p2">And that\'s why I said in the opening, I believe that that --it\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be challenging, but we\'ve made a real priority of working with our partners who are also leaders in providing support to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 Saudi Arabia is one of those.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\'s fair to say that our assistance -- our cooperation on assistance is getting better and better and it\'s a real priority for both of us.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just would like to clarify on that last point about harmonization and working with the allies -- even if decisions were not made at this particular meeting, are you taking steps to expand the training and equipping of the moderate Syrian opposition -- not alone, but in concert with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and other partners in the region? \xc2\xa0If you haven\'t taken such steps in recent weeks and months, are you planning to do so?\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re not planning to do so, what tangible accomplishments have come out of this meeting and the meetings leading up to it?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michael, first of all, as a general matter, as you know, we don\'t get into the details of the types of assistance that we provide.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear that we are working in concert with allies and partners to strengthen the moderate opposition as, again, a military entity that does include military assistance, but we don\'t get into the specific types of that assistance.</p>\n<p class="p2">What I would say, though, is we have been improving that coordination and planning with our partners and allies.\xc2\xa0 When you look at the London 11 group and you look at the discussions that we\'ve had in intelligence and security channels, we have been able to improve the way in which we provide assistance into Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been able to come to a more common view about the groups that we provide support to within Syria.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been able to discuss what more effective means are in terms of strengthening them going forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">So I would say that we made progress on this in the last several months, particularly from the fall up to now.\xc2\xa0 And so we feel like we\'re in a stronger place as a collective group in support of the Syrian opposition today than we were several months ago.</p>\n<p class="p2">I think this meeting continues to enforce the strategic direction that the United States and Saudi Arabia have in sharing an objective of bringing about a political transition and an end to the Assad regime, but the necessity of providing that assistance to the opposition so that they are a stronger counterweight to the regime.\xc2\xa0 I think when we are aligned strategically it, again, is in service of the ongoing discussions that we have in those intelligence and security channels about what the best way is for us to coordinate our assistance.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow?\xc2\xa0 When you talk about better coordination and understanding between you and the Saudis and the Gulf countries, does that mean that you\'re absolutely confident that the people the Saudis are arming are the people you vetted, you screened in the opposition?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, sure, I\'m absolutely confident.\xc2\xa0 I made the point earlier that it\'s not just about the amount and types of assistance, but about strengthening the right groups and being most effective about it.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t know if in the situation in Syria you can ever be absolutely confident about anything, but what we\'re trying to do is agree on who we are trying to help, who we\'re not trying to help, and take advantage of economies of scale and make the opposition more unified.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what assistance -- that\'s what coordination of assistance is about.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the level of coordination, the improvement of coordination gives you more comfort to change the quality of assistance, to give items that you were not wanting to give in the past to the opposition?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Just as a general rule, the more confidence we can have in different groups the more and better assistance we can provide to those groups.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And just to be slightly more specific, too -- we\'ve raised our concerns publicly and privately about ISIL, about al Nusra, and of course, we\'ve indicated our support for the SMC and the SOC, and we believe that we have a common view in terms of wanting to strengthen the right forces in the country.\xc2\xa0 And what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recent months is not only has the opposition been fighting against the regime, but they have been in a conflict with some of those more extremist elements, which makes it only that much more urgent for us to be ensuring that they have the support that they need, because, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99re the alternative to the Assad regime that we have said we want to come to an end, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also the alternative to more extremist elements in the opposition.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 And my colleague mentioning the SOC as well as the SMC is important because this is not just about helping the armed opposition.\xc2\xa0 You have a relatively unified Assad regime under this dictatorship fighting a vast array of disparate groups both on the armed side and the unarmed side, and if you want any chance of changing the balance such that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get the political transition that we believe is the only way to bring civility back to Syria, it\'s only if you can unify those groups in the opposition, both on the armed side and on the civilian side.</p>\n<p class="p2">So the SOC -- we also have a dialogue with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries about the political opposition, because unless and until they\xe2\x80\x99re unified and backed by the armed side, they\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to be able to change the balance in the right way against the regime.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I asked you the question on Air Force One on the way here about the humanitarian issue, and I\'m wondering to what extent that came up?\xc2\xa0 What did the President tell the King about concerns about the -- I said humanitarian -- human rights issues, I should say, in Saudi Arabia?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, the beginning of your question I will pick up on -- you mentioned the humanitarian -- you started with the humanitarian --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I meant to say human rights abuses that many human rights organizations are complaining about, bipartisan members of Congress are complaining about in this country that we have such great relations with.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, like I said, this was an opportunity to focus primarily on the importance of the strategic partnership and regional issues.\xc2\xa0 There were a whole lot of issues on our bilateral agenda that weren\xe2\x80\x99t the focus of this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I do want to take the opportunity to say -- because you started by talking about humanitarian --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I apologize --</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Okay, well --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did human rights abuse issues come up at all in the President\xe2\x80\x99s talk?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: \xc2\xa0The focus of the meeting was strategic and regional topics.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it did not come up?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We need a yes or a no.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, really.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did it come up?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Can I just finish what I wanted to say about the humanitarian thing?\xc2\xa0 Because I mentioned Syria and I alluded to it, but I want to underscore -- King Abdullah began with that piece and actually showed how pained he is by the humanitarian situation in Syria.\xc2\xa0 So a significant part of the discussion was not just on what we can do, what we\'ve been talking about here, coordinating our assistance to different groups, but what we can do to help the poor people of Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a high priority for the King; it\'s a high priority for the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">As you all know, the United States is a leading donor of humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 And I just wanted to be absolutely clear that even as we work on all these other tracks -- chemical weapons, political situation, opposition and so on -- we\'re not losing sight of what really matters here, which is the fate of the people of Syria and its neighbors.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me just add one thing here.\xc2\xa0 As we said, we raise a range of issues, including human rights, in our regular dialogue with the Saudis, even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a focus of this meeting.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if our schedule has gone out for tomorrow, but tomorrow morning, the President at our hotel will be able to see the State Department Women of Courage award winner from Saudi Arabia this year, Dr. Maha Al Muneef.</p>\n<p class="p3">We\xe2\x80\x99ll send this out.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s the Executive Director of the National Family Safety Program here in Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 She\xe2\x80\x99s an advocate against domestic violence.\xc2\xa0 Over many years, she\xe2\x80\x99s played an instrumental role in raising the profile of the issue here.\xc2\xa0 And she also played a critical role in landmark legislation that recently passed in Saudi Arabia -- the \xe2\x80\x9cProtection from Abuse\xe2\x80\x9d law, which for the first time defines and criminalizes domestic violence as it relates to women.</p>\n<p class="p4">She was not able to attend the Women of Courage award ceremony that Michelle Obama was at in March at the State Department, so the President will be able to give her this award tomorrow in person.\xc2\xa0 Again, women\xe2\x80\x99s issues is a particular human rights focus for us in our dialogue with the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, religious freedom has been as well.\xc2\xa0 These issues we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to raise bilaterally with the Saudis.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick housekeeping thing.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be some confusion as to whether or not there was supposed to be a dinner after the bilateral meeting.\xc2\xa0 Can you clear that up?\xc2\xa0 The State Department actually tweeted out that there was going to be a dinner.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Yes, no -- there was some discussion of a dinner before we left for the trip, but several days ago, just for logistic reasons and the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 schedules, the decision was made to just have it be a bilat -- you know, we were getting in late.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read anything into it other than the fact that that decision was made several days ago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the schedule that we put out last night, the public schedule for today.</p>\n<p class="p2">They were able to have an over two-hour meeting, so they were fully able to cover a lot of ground.\xc2\xa0 The King was very gracious for this hospitality.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to make a leap in any direction with this follow-up question, but did the President engage in any -- I know this was a bilateral meeting -- but engage in any discussions with the Crown Prince?\xc2\xa0 We noticed the breathing tube that the King was using, and he is of advanced age.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what does the future hold in that regard with respect to this relationship, which obviously would have to continue to go on?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a sensitive question, but --</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, the King, as my colleague just said -- first of all, the King looked well and sustained a very vigorous discussion about very serious issues with the President.\xc2\xa0 He was in good spirits, so there really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an issue there.\xc2\xa0 The Crown Prince was in the meeting, but it was the President and the King who had the conversation, had the bilateral meeting.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give just a general sense of the tone?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously the Saudis have expressed real concern about U.S. policy in Syria and Iran and Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Was this in any way tense?\xc2\xa0 Or was he aggressive in presenting those concerns?\xc2\xa0 Just a general --</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Again, without speaking for the Saudis, I think the King appreciated the fact that the President came here to see him face-to-face.\xc2\xa0 He was very gracious.\xc2\xa0 This was not a contentious meeting.\xc2\xa0 It was a good meeting.\xc2\xa0 They really had an open conversation.\xc2\xa0 They both said, look, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for us to be perfectly honest with each other.\xc2\xa0 I think the King is known for being frank and honest.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say he claimed that there were no differences and everything -- that we saw everything eye-to-eye on every single issue.</p>\n<p class="p3">He was able to articulate his views on Iran and Syria.\xc2\xa0 I told you how the President articulated our views, which we thought was important so that there are no misunderstandings, so the Saudis or the King don\xe2\x80\x99t think that somehow trying to pursue our interests by stopping Iran from getting a nuclear weapon through diplomacy means that somehow we are na\xc3\xafve about Iran or overlooking some of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s other policies.\xc2\xa0 So that was important on our side.</p>\n<p class="p3">The King also -- the King had a chance, in a very frank way, to talk about what he thinks needs to be done in Syria and his perspectives on Iran.\xc2\xa0 So in that sense, it really was what it was meant to be, which was a chance for these two leaders to sit down face-to-face.\xc2\xa0 But really, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an opportunity to make complaints or express anger in any way.\xc2\xa0 It was quite the opposite.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about Egypt?</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Egypt also wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a focus. \xc2\xa0I mean, two hours may sound like a long time, but with the catching-up to do and then the focus on the regional policy issues in some detail -- which, the ones I mentioned, Iran and Syria, were both very detailed -- they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to every issue that is important to both of us.\xc2\xa0 But what they did at the end was, one, note that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to every issue and there was so much more to talk about, and asked each other to make sure that their most senior officials continue to communicate -- which they already do, of course.</p>\n<p class="p3">And like I said, the King has spoken -- the President has spoken to the King on the phone a number of times.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been exchanging other communications.\xc2\xa0 But they noted at the end, as important and useful as this long meeting was, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much more to cover, including some of the issues you all have raised.\xc2\xa0 And they specifically said, let\xe2\x80\x99s have our senior officials really follow up on all of these things.</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Let me just follow up.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think an important point here is that, on Iran, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said with Israel, for instance, we understand that given the history of the Saudis\xe2\x80\x99 relation with Iran and their proximity to Iran, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be skeptical; that we basically price into the Iranian nuclear negotiations that our Gulf partners are going to be watching with a skeptical eye to make sure that we are getting a good deal.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate given the fact that a lot of the destabilizing activity that Iran undertakes is right in their neighborhood -- their support for the Houthis in Yemen; some of their destabilizing activities in the Gulf, as well as, of course, their support for Hezbollah.</p>\n<p class="p3">So the point the President has made repeatedly is that we are interested in getting a deal that meets our concerns, that assures that the program -- the Iranian nuclear program is peaceful.\xc2\xa0 That, ultimately, would be in the interest of Saudi Arabia and the region, because Iran would be a far more destabilizing force if they had a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 So ultimately, those talks we believe could yield an outcome that is in service of regional security.\xc2\xa0 But if we can\xe2\x80\x99t get the outcome we want, the President has made very clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to take a bad deal either.</p>\n<p class="p3">On Syria, I actually think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to channel our efforts into coming together and finding common ground on particularly the question of humanitarian assistance and support for the opposition.\xc2\xa0 There clearly was some difference about the United States not taking military action inside of Syria.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that, frankly, the objective of the military action we were contemplating was chemical weapons, and those are being dealt with through the removal of chemical weapons that is underway, and ultimately their destruction.</p>\n<p class="p3">When it comes to the underlying conflict, we, frankly, didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s a U.S. military option that could bring that conflict to a conclusion and that there needs to be political settlement, but that needs to be reinforced by opposition -- the support for the opposition.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s where we\xe2\x80\x99ve channeled things since the fall, when some of these tensions emerged.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one, a quick answer.\xc2\xa0 You know that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be asked about it.\xc2\xa0 You know the American public has questions about human rights in Saudi Arabia, which in some way seem to be getting worse with the passage of those new anti-terror laws.\xc2\xa0 And the President has spent the last week talking about the rights of the individual, democracy.\xc2\xa0 He met with the Pope and chastised Putin for ignoring human rights.\xc2\xa0 So can you just give us an answer as to why it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up?</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that the fact of the matter is we have a significant amount of issues with the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences in the relationship and convergences on the relationship.\xc2\xa0 Differences include human rights.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is, today, given the extent of time that they spent on Iran and Syria, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to a number of issues and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just human rights.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to some of the other regional issues that are part of our bilateral relationship as well.</p>\n<p class="p3">We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to raise these issues associated with human rights, with reforms here in the Kingdom, on a regular basis in all of our interactions with the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that given the time they had today and given the need to focus intensively on Iran and Syria in particular, they just didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to the full agenda.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that the human rights situation here seems to be getting worse in some ways?</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would agree that we would have a lot of -- we do have a lot of significant concerns about the human rights situation that have been ongoing with respect to women\xe2\x80\x99s rights, with respect to religious freedom, with respect to free and open dialogue.\xc2\xa0 And certainly, some of the recent laws raise questions in those areas of people\xe2\x80\x99s ability to express themselves freely.</p>\n<p class="p3">We\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences on human rights as it relates to practices in Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had differences over issues in the region on some of these cases.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned earlier today the differences that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with some of the steps that the Egyptian government has taken -- for instance, in detaining journalists; the recent announcement of a fairly shocking number of death sentences.</p>\n<p class="p3">So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue this dialogue.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is given the range of security interests that we have in the region, Saudi Arabia has been a longstanding partner, and so we have to be able to both continue working with them on that agenda, even as we\xe2\x80\x99re going to differ on issues related to human rights.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things, just so we get it on the record -- did the situation with the Jerusalem Post reporter come up at all?\xc2\xa0 And, two, the Women of Courage award, is that going to be an open press event or a travel pool event?</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the press access.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s at the hotel. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big, open press event that\xe2\x80\x99s for certain.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we have a pool over there.</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that and get back to you.\xc2\xa0 On the Jerusalem Post, look, this is something that Susan has been raising directly with the Saudis.\xc2\xa0 We have made our views very clear on this.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it came up in the meeting, but this is -- they certainly know our views and our objection to the way in which that situation was handled.</p>\n<p class="p3">Just a couple more.\xc2\xa0 Carol.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you just kind of sum up your takeaways from this meeting and how relations between the U.S. and the Saudis have changed in the meetings leading up to this meeting and then after this meeting?\xc2\xa0 Because it sounds like your view on, for instance, assistance to those Syrian rebels has changed in that you\xe2\x80\x99re more willing to give more if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to the right elements of the opposition, and that the U.S. and Saudis are more on the same page about who exactly that opposition is.\xc2\xa0 Yet, there are still types of things you aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to do.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the AP has a story out saying that you have shifted and are willing to do MANPADS under certain restrictions.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify exactly --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just directly address that AP story, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Look, we have not changed our position on providing MANPADS to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We have said it\xe2\x80\x99s a proliferation risk.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s just -- this is not an issue that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 It was not a part of the meeting, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no change in the U.S. position.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss the details of types of systems, but we have made very clear publicly our concerns about this one particular system because it does have a proliferation risk.\xc2\xa0 And this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a focus of the meeting.\xc2\xa0 There was no discussion about it leading into the meeting.\xc2\xa0 We, again, have a dialogue on these issues that takes place in security channels, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to stay.</p>\n<p class="p3">But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if my colleague can address it broader.</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, the broader thing -- we came here in the face of a perception -- which I know is a perception because I read it in the newspaper on the airplane on the way in here -- of somehow a split between these two longstanding partners.\xc2\xa0 And that big differences over --</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And there was, right?</p>\n<p class="p3">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sorry?</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s correct, right?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I guess -- you asked about takeaway.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is.\xc2\xa0 The narrative referred to as somehow a big split over a lot of key regional issues and lack of trust and questions, and I think what these couple of hours of conversations demonstrate and what the President wanted to underscore is actually our strategic interests are much more aligned than different -- which, once again, is not to say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been exactly aligned on all of these issues, which is not particularly surprising, but compared to what we have in common, and even on those issues -- on Iran and Syria -- again, the President with the opportunity to say we are determined to counter their support for terrorism in the region and destabilizing activities -- for the King to hear that directly from the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99re determined to stop them from getting a nuclear weapon; on Syria, we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe there can be stability under the Assad regime, we need to help the people of Syria, we need to support the moderate opposition.</p>\n<p class="p2">So I think when the leaders have an opportunity to spend so much time talking about these things, I do think it leaves you with a sense that we actually are indeed strategic partners with a lot of interests in common.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned earlier energy.\xc2\xa0 Our defense relationship is enormous.\xc2\xa0 Economic; nonproliferation.\xc2\xa0 Our defense commitment is solid.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s a takeaway I think is important that we may have different tactical approaches on some very difficult questions, but we remain important core partners.</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 One more over there, yes.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 So I just wanted to talk about Iran, because this issue of the President saying that you understand this destabilizing role that Iran is playing.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense here and in the region that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s isolation, diplomatic isolation is ending, that actually -- what is being done to stop that destabilizing force, especially at the moment with the concern in Yemen?</p>\n<p class="p2">SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the nuclear negotiations are aimed at achieving a very specific objective related to the nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 I think part of the concern has been that the nuclear negotiations represent a broader rapprochement between the United States and the West and Iran.\xc2\xa0 But the fact of the matter is that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be the case if we don\xe2\x80\x99t see changes from Iran and these other areas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">For instance, all of our sanctions on terrorism-related issues are fully in place with respect to Iran.\xc2\xa0 In terms of what we do, we\xe2\x80\x99re working against the Assad regime in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Together with our Gulf partners we are working to support the Yemeni government.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve worked to at times expose Iranian support as a means of disrupting the types of support that they could provide, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s to the Houthis or other groups around the region.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We work with a lot of countries in trying to counter Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s activities, targeting their financing, intelligence cooperation, strengthening the Lebanese Armed Forces.\xc2\xa0 So I think on the Hezbollah side of the equation, we have a lot of actions all over the world that are frankly geared at cracking down on Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s activities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">So, again, I think across the board we have a very aggressive set of measures that we\xe2\x80\x99re using to counter Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for terrorism, to expose and counter its efforts to destabilize countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 And those are going to be ongoing, and those also depend on the cooperation we have with our partners here.</p>\n<p class="p2">But at the end of the day, if we can get a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear issue that assures that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program is peaceful, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a good thing.\xc2\xa0 A nuclear-armed Iran would be far more dangerous in terms of its ability to destabilize the region, to leverage its support for terrorism.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re so invested in that project.\xc2\xa0 And I think our view is at the end of the day, if we can achieve that diplomatic resolution that will be good for the security of the Gulf and of the region.\xc2\xa0 If the Iranians make further changes in their policies as it relates to these other issues, then there may be the prospect of looking at a broader conversation.\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing that.</p>\n<p class="p2">As near as we can tell, their actions in terms of their regional behavior is the same today as it was before these nuclear talks began.\xc2\xa0 And our efforts to counter those Iranian actions are the same today as they were before the nuclear talks began.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s a steady state in an issue where I think we have more convergence with the Saudis as a matter of policy than divergence.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n9:11 P.M.
