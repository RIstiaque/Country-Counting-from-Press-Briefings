BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I figured since there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of this that it\xe2\x80\x99s just going to get kicked to the afternoon briefing -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll just do this right now and -- fire away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Petraeus collapsing in the Senate hearing, has the President been informed, do you guys know about it, has he talked to Petraeus?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your status update?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 The President has been informed.\xc2\xa0 Sounds like General Petraeus is doing pretty good.\xc2\xa0 At this point, the President has not spoken to him.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Potentially.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- going to be able to meet his deadline of withdrawing from Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously aware of the press reports today about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of the height of violence season in that country.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly reviewing where things stand, but as the President said in his West Point speech, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be -- there will be another full review come December.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, we feel like we are on pace to hand over the safety and security of the country of Afghanistan to the people of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>As he said before, July 11, 2011, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the date of some massive drawdown.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the date that we begin to transition our forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go back to Petraeus real quick?\xc2\xa0 Did you know if he was hospitalized -- you said he\xe2\x80\x99s doing pretty good -- what are you basing that on?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s based on conversations that our staff had with his staff.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s been hospitalized.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the speech tonight, there are Republicans who have been warning the President not to bring up cap and trade, that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be appropriate given the crisis, that he should concentrate on the recovery.\xc2\xa0 Any response to that?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to bring it up in the speech?\xc2\xa0 Are you able to give us any highlights?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll say about the speech tonight -- and of course, point you towards the briefing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen by at 5:30 p.m. by phone with some senior administration officials -- but some of the points the President is going to focus on are what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done so far to -- at the direction -- to direct BP to stop the leak, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to work with folks in the region to help clean up the oil, mitigate the environmental disaster, what we need to do going forward in order to mitigate the economic crisis that people are facing as a result of this.\xc2\xa0 We saw a lot of those small business owners while we were in the Gulf region on this trip, and the President has before.\xc2\xa0 And this has been a very tough season for a region that is already hit pretty hard by the recession that we\xe2\x80\x99re in.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he\xe2\x80\x99ll also talk about what we need to do in terms of safety regulations to make sure that this sort of thing never happens again.\xc2\xa0 But aside from that, I would just point you to the briefing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen later on today.\xc2\xa0 The speech has obviously been written.\xc2\xa0 The President is continuing to go through and make some edits, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that too much.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the Republicans, though, trying to preempt any talk of cap and trade?\xc2\xa0 Any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I think that no matter what we say, Republicans will continue to have their opinions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, the President has said on this trip that he would like to bring the Gulf back to better than before.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what\xe2\x80\x99s the time frame for that?\xc2\xa0 And is that something that he would expect BP to entirely foot the bill for?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is -- we\xe2\x80\x99re facing an environmental catastrophe the likes of which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t really seen before.\xc2\xa0 And the President knows, just like the people of this region know, that getting back to stronger than they were even before is going to take some time.</p>\n<p>I would point you to what the President said at that -- at the event on the beach in Pensacola, where he talked about the fact that if we work hard and if we stop as much oil as we can from reaching the shores, clean up the oil that gets here, and help to stem some of that -- some of the problems associated with that, then even as soon as next year some of these beaches will be fine.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Right now, a lot of these beaches are great to visit.\xc2\xa0 The President encourages you to do that.\xc2\xa0 But in places where it\xe2\x80\x99s affected, he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to turn that around as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 But this is going to be a long process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the beaches are so great to visit, will the President be canceling his Martha\xe2\x80\x99s Vineyard trip and summering in Pensacola?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 For starters, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t locked in any summer plans for the President.\xc2\xa0 And so I would just say -- I guess the premise of your question can\xe2\x80\x99t even be answered.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Gibbs said this morning that at the end of July, 90 percent-plus of the oil will be contained.\xc2\xa0 Is he talking about the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s already been released, or he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s spewing from the gusher right now?\xc2\xa0 Could you explain a little bit more?\xc2\xa0 Also, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming that\xe2\x80\x99s based on information he\xe2\x80\x99s gotten from BP.\xc2\xa0 Why would you believe information from BP?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 For starters, he was referring to the oil that\xe2\x80\x99s currently coming out of the hole at the bottom of the ocean.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s not everything that\xe2\x80\x99s been released.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s based on the containment capacity that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have with different ships that are coming in and the different methods that they\xe2\x80\x99re using to get all that oil contained that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.</p>\n<p>Part of the way that this is -- this comes about, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very complex scientific process by which they determine how much oil is coming out, how much is being contained.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s based on the best estimates that our own scientists have, working in conjunction with other folks who have the equipment down at the bottom of the ocean.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought that the response, the federal response, that the flow rate didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Allen and President Obama said, that the initial response -- the flow rate didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, everybody was preparing for a catastrophic event no matter what.\xc2\xa0 But now you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that ships are coming in with more estimates, better estimates coming in -- you\xe2\x80\x99re taking additional steps.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that suggest that the original statements aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a slight conflation of two different things.\xc2\xa0 What was initially said was that regardless of the specific number of gallons that were spewed into the ocean each day, the federal government had mobilized the most possible assets in order to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 Right now, there are thousands of ships -- there are tens of thousands of personnel who are down there helping to deal with this issue.</p>\n<p>So in terms of what our response is in order to stop the oil from coming out and in order to clean it up, no matter how much that flow rate was, we\xe2\x80\x99re still going to be as aggressive as humanly possible.</p>\n<p>What was the second part of your question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand --</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Oh, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we trust BP?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, now I have two things.\xc2\xa0 Yes, that one.\xc2\xa0 And then also, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why the flow rate didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter before but now it matters.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say -- well, it\xe2\x80\x99s two different things.\xc2\xa0 On the one hand, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter in terms of the fact that we mobilized as aggressive a response as has ever been mobilized in the history of our country in an environmental catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 It does matter in the sense that you need to know how much oil is coming up to know how much you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to capture and move to other places in the line.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I would say that in terms of response, we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can.\xc2\xa0 In terms of capture, it helps to know how much oil is coming so that you know how much you need to put inside the boat to move it away.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then the thing about BP, why you would trust their information.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, it\xe2\x80\x99s our own team of scientists who are working in conjunction with folks who --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, talk about the energy piece of the speech tonight a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what -- give us a little flavor of what he is going to say, if you can.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99ll point you to the call that\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen later on, because the speech is still in process.\xc2\xa0 But moving to a new energy economy is something the President has talked about since the first day of his administration, and you can bet he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about that some tonight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you agreed with BP on the size of the escrow account?\xc2\xa0 And if so, what is the size of the escrow account?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something that every particular is still in process.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements for you on any piece of the escrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President give us a number on the escrow account tonight?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would say just hold out and wait for the actual speech.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s important to the President as it relates to the claims process is that they\xe2\x80\x99re handled fairly, promptly, and that BP has enough money to make these folks whole who have been hurt so much by the spill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any response to the emails that have come out of Congress, the BP emails indicating people calling it a \xe2\x80\x9cnightmare well,\xe2\x80\x9d et cetera, before the explosion?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 This is something that -- we knew there were some major problems here.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been a commission put in place in order to take a real hard look at what went wrong, who did the wrong thing, and what we need to do to make sure that those folks are addressed and this never happens again.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get ahead of our own commission and what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to come out with.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it evident, though, to the administration and the Justice Department at this point that there was criminal negligence on the part of BP?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just point you to the Justice Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get in front of DOJ.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two seconds ago, you said that the President is concerned about BP\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean he\xe2\x80\x99s worried that they\xe2\x80\x99re liquid enough and that they have enough cash reserves for this escrow account?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 What I said was the President wanted to make sure that they had enough money put away in order to pay.\xc2\xa0 That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a concern that they had -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of assets, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got plenty of cash.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to work to make sure that the money is put in the right place to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of the Gulf region.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the escrow account, if he is not -- if you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about tonight, can you say that he will have a number by tomorrow after they finish their meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we want to do one final on -- has the President seen the reports that Senator Kennedy had multiple death threats?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any comment on that?\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of it?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view on that?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s seen the reports, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President said that he was going to make it better down there when this was all through.\xc2\xa0 What is he going to do about the oppressive heat?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 There are some things that even President Obama is not capable of.\xc2\xa0 But, boy, you guys look terrible today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A motley crew, we are a motley crew.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:56 P.M.
