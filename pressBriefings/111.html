Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t1:22 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I apologize for the late start today. \xc2\xa0Let me do one quick thing at the top, and then we\'ll hustle on to your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs many of you have heard me say many times before, the United States is on the brink of finalizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. \xc2\xa0And we\'re hopeful that the Congress will work to approve the highest-standard trade agreement in history, particularly when it comes to protecting labor and environmental rights, intellectual property and a variety of other areas. \xc2\xa0This is an agreement, as we\'ve discussed many times, that will cut 18,000 taxes that various countries impose on products that are made in America. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, part of this discussion has been the administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to enforcing our trade laws. \xc2\xa0Our track record when it comes to enforcement actions at the WTO is quite good. \xc2\xa0To date, the United States has brought 20 enforcement actions to the WTO. That\'s more than any other member of the WTO. \xc2\xa0And in fact, where every one of those disputes has been decided, the United States has won. \xc2\xa0We\'re undefeated. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI mention that because that winning streak continued today. The WTO made an announcement today that the United States has won a challenge to rules in India that discriminate against imported solar products. \xc2\xa0This represents a significant victory for the rapid deployment of solar energy across the world, but also for clean jobs right here in America. \xc2\xa0It also represents, as I mentioned, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s continuing emphasis on using all the tools at our disposal to hold our trading partners accountable.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, in order to further expand our robust trade enforcement efforts, the President will sign into law today H.R. 644 -- this is the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. \xc2\xa0Among other things, this bill will create a trade enforcement trust fund to provide new resources currently authorized at $15 million per year for trade enforcement efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also will bolster the enforcement tools that we can use to protect intellectual property rights, and it will also give the United States new and unprecedented measures to address unfair currency practices. \xc2\xa0I know this is a sticking point with many members of Congress who are considering their support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \xc2\xa0The conference report for H.R. 644 that the President will sign into law today creates a new, binding mechanism to confront countries that engage in unfair currency practices, and requires the administration to impose penalties on countries that fail to work with us. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is serious both about having access to these tools, but also in using them in a way that we can protect the American economy, American businesses, and most importantly, American workers.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with all that out of the way, Darlene, do you want to kick us off?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0I have a couple different topics to poke you on today.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First, what is the response from here to Speaker Ryan saying that Republicans are taking legal steps to stop the President from taking unilateral action to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did observe that Republicans certainly seem to be in a pretty litigious mood these days. \xc2\xa0And I guess this is just the latest installment in that. \xc2\xa0Look, if they spent just a portion of the time that they do in hiring lawyers at taxpayer expense to sue the President to actually work with the President to make progress on behalf of the American people, they\xe2\x80\x99d have a lot more to show for their work. \xc2\xa0And whether that is closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, approving the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or even fulfilling the vacancy at the Supreme Court, this is the basic work that the Constitution and the American people expect of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And that applies, at least in some of those cases, to the House of Representatives as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, look, when it comes to our plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, that\'s something that we laid out yesterday and it\'s a plan that we believe merits serious consideration by the United States Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A question on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the King of Jordan. \xc2\xa0Jordan has been talking a lot about needing more aid to deal with the Syrian refugees. \xc2\xa0Did the President offer any additional assistance specifically to Jordan to deal with the refugee issue there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President did discuss some additional military assistance that the United States will be providing Jordan. \xc2\xa0Obviously the United States and Jordan have an important security relationship that enhances the national security of both our countries. \xc2\xa0The President talked about why that relationship is particularly important, and it will be enhanced with these additional resources that were announced today.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to the humanitarian crisis caused by Syria, and that means that we\'ve offered significant assistance to the Jordanians who, themselves, have demonstrated tremendous generosity in meeting the basic humanitarian needs of hundreds of thousands, if not more than a million people, who have fled to Jordan from Syria, trying to escape violence.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd this is just one particularly troubling consequence of the chaos inside of Syria right now. \xc2\xa0And the United States will continue to stand with Jordan as they certainly are doing more than their fair share here to address that situation. \xc2\xa0There were not any new announcements as it relates to humanitarian assistance today. \xc2\xa0But I certainly would not rule out additional humanitarian assistance being provided by the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you know what percentage of the assistance the U.S. has already given to help Syrian refugees who have gone to Jordan?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have that statistic, but I can certainly look to see if that\'s something we can make available to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0The announcement yesterday by Senator McConnell that there would be no hearing, no vote, not even any meetings with whoever the President chooses for the Supreme Court -- does that not complicate the process for him choosing someone? \xc2\xa0Because you then have to find someone who is going to be willing to put themselves in the middle of this not regular situation when it comes to a Supreme Court nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Darlene, I certainly would agree with that description. \xc2\xa0I think we have seen an unprecedented attempt to inject politics into the situation, and that\'s rather unfortunate. \xc2\xa0It\'s inconsistent with the expectations of the United States Constitution. \xc2\xa0I think it\'s also inconsistent with the expectations of the American people. \xc2\xa0The American people expect that the United States Senate will do their job. \xc2\xa0And right now, you have members of the United States Senate suggesting that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do their job for the next 11 months. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s a position that\'s rather difficult to justify.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut that\'s something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to determine -- they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to determine for themselves whether or not this is a position that they can maintain. \xc2\xa0The President certainly is intent on following through on his constitutional responsibilities. \xc2\xa0The President will do his job. \xc2\xa0And in fact, his team is already hard at work at preparing materials for him so that he can eventually choose the best person to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the kinds of people who would be considered for a position like this I think are well aware that every debate that takes place -- well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0Certainly in the modern era, anybody that\'s been nominated to the Supreme Court has gone through a rigorous vetting process. \xc2\xa0It\'s not supposed to be an easy process. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t think the expectation is -- it\'s certainly not the expectation of the President that it\'s going to be easy. \xc2\xa0But it is the expectation of the President -- and again, I think it\'s the expectation of the American people -- that it\'s a process that will be carried out seriously, and that places constitutional responsibilities ahead of narrow political considerations. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that is why both the President is committed to following through on his responsibility. \xc2\xa0I also think it\'s why that when the President has decided on the right person to fill this vacancy that that person will be enthusiastic about what is a weighty responsibility but also a tremendous opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you don\'t think it will make the search more difficult?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I will tell you -- obviously I can\'t speak for someone who has not been asked yet, but I can tell you that when it comes to our search process, we are going to set aside politics and we are going to be focused on helping the President make a decision about who the best person in America is to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That\'s what he will be focused on, and that\'s how he will make his decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Moving on to Syria. \xc2\xa0I know the President said today that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise expectations -- or was cautious about raising expectations about the cessation of hostilities agreement there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s right.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry has said that if the parties don\'t live up to the agreement or if these peace talks fail, that there have been a lot of discussions about a plan B, and that there are other options. \xc2\xa0Can you talk a bit about what would be the plan B if these peace talks don\'t go ahead -- if people don\'t comply with this agreement, what are the other options for the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I know that when people refer to a plan B it assumes that diplomacy will fail. \xc2\xa0And I think that in some cases, people using that terminology assume that that means a consideration of military options. \xc2\xa0And at this point, I\'m unwilling to discuss potential military options at a time when we\'re hoping that diplomacy can succeed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re clear-eyed about the situation, and I think you heard me acknowledge earlier this week that we anticipate that there will be some obstacles to the implementation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0I would anticipate that in the early days it will be difficult to implement, that there will be some violations, and it will be unclear after a few days or maybe even after a few weeks about whether or not this understanding will stick. \xc2\xa0But right now, that\'s where our attention is focused. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have important military objectives inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0Of course, we do. \xc2\xa0The cessation of hostilities does not apply in any way and does not have any impact on our ability to continue to press the case against ISIL. In fact, the reason that we are trying to put in place this cessation of hostilities is in part to get the parties to focus on the need to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, and begin to make additional progress on the political tract and begin to negotiate the kind of long-overdue political solution that everyone acknowledges is required.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But these discussions of a plan B, do they include military options?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate at this point about what a plan B would include, because our focus right now is so squarely on trying to ensure the successful implementation of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0And I want to be clear, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be obvious after a few days, or even few weeks, about whether or not the implementation has succeeded. \xc2\xa0In fact, we anticipate that there will be some obstacles that are encountered basically right away.</p>\n<p>\n\tI should point out that the responsibility is not just resting with the United States. \xc2\xa0The Russians and the Syrian regime have a significant burden to bear here in making sure that this understanding about a cessation of hostilities can be effectively implemented. \xc2\xa0And based on the understanding that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached, the world can see exactly what the expectations are of the Russians and the Syrians, and it puts them on the hook for making sure that his can succeed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today, the President is going to be meeting with the VFW commander. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some scandal with the VA hospital in Cincinnati. \xc2\xa0There were talks about cuts of medical services. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been an investigation -- presence of dirty surgical equipment in hospital rooms, and things of that nature. \xc2\xa0Has the White House looked into this at all? \xc2\xa0Has the President raised any concerns with the VA Secretary about this? \xc2\xa0Are there concerns about this scandal in Cincinnati?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, most importantly, the VA Secretary has looked into this. \xc2\xa0This is a situation that the White House is aware of. \xc2\xa0But Secretary McDonald has worked assiduously in the couple of years that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in that role to implement some overdue reforms and making sure that we are keeping faith with our veterans. \xc2\xa0And there was important work that needed to be done to make sure that those health care services were being provided in a timely fashion and that they were getting the kind of high-quality attention that they deserve. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s been painstaking work. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut Secretary McDonald has been serious about implementing these reforms and improving the performance of the VA. \xc2\xa0And we certainly are pleased with the progress that has been made under his leadership, but I think everybody around here acknowledges that there is more important work that needs to be done in this regard. \xc2\xa0And I think when you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about something that is a priority as high as this, trying to meet the health care needs of millions of our bravest citizens, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that work is ever going to be finished in making sure that we are serving them in a manner that they deserve. \xc2\xa0And certainly, Secretary McDonald takes that seriously. \xc2\xa0I can assure you that the Commander-in-Chief takes that seriously. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to watch these situations, moving forward. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0The President said in the Oval today, multiple times, that the American people should decide on his nominee. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- I mean, that seems to signal kind of a shift from what you guys have been talking about, which is engaging with senators directly. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if it sort of previews you guys gearing up for now kind of a public fight or a political fight over your Supreme Court nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, I would urge you not to read that as a shift, primarily because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President intended to send a signal of any kind about a shift. \xc2\xa0Our focus right now is on nominating the best person for the job. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility right now, and he\xe2\x80\x99s hard at work on that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd when asked what\xe2\x80\x99s going to change the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s mind about this nominee and convince the Senate that they should fulfill their responsibility to give the nominee the courtesy of a meeting, and do what every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has done, which is appear at a hearing before the United States Senate to discuss their potential nomination -- that\xe2\x80\x99s true of every nominee who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t withdrawn before the hearing was convened. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a longstanding precedent here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I do think that the President believes that we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to continue to make our case to the United States Senate that they should do their job. \xc2\xa0The President has called a significant number of the members of the Judiciary Committee, both Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0And the President is hoping that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to actually meet with the chair and ranking member of that important committee who would consider -- who would host those hearings and consider the nominee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last I heard is that Senator Leahy, who\xe2\x80\x99s the ranking member, has said that he\xe2\x80\x99s eager to meet this week. \xc2\xa0We have not yet heard back from Chairman Grassley, but we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to schedule that meeting quite soon. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President has done the two previous times that he sought to fill those vacancies -- he\xe2\x80\x99s had meetings in the Oval Office with the chair and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, both in 2009 and 2010. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he wants to do this time, because he takes seriously his responsibility to consult with Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly going to continue to be making our case. But I think the President is alluding to the fact that I think most Americans agree that senators weren\xe2\x80\x99t elected to a term of five years and one month, but rather, they were elected to six-year terms. \xc2\xa0And they should spend that six years doing what the Constitution describes. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make, and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s broad public agreement about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of that consultation, The Washington Post reported earlier today that Senator Reid had asked the President to look at the Governor of Nevada as one of the candidates for the Supreme Court, and that the White House was vetting Governor Sandoval. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can talk at all about whether that request was made by Senator Reid, and if on the list that you have said is not complete, that Governor Sandoval is one of those names.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have reported that the President has spoken to Senator Reid about the Supreme Court vacancy. \xc2\xa0He did that at the end of last week. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details about their conversation to share with you. \xc2\xa0I haven\'t read The Washington Post story, but I was told about it before I walked out here. \xc2\xa0I suspect it is only the first of many stories that speculate on potential Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be helpful for me to get into a rhythm of responding to each one as it appears.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re going to let the process play out. \xc2\xa0The President is going to conduct this work rigorously. \xc2\xa0And once he has chosen the best person to fill this vacancy, then we can have a conversation about that individual\xe2\x80\x99s credentials.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I asked you last week about work in the Senate on an encryption bill that would allow law enforcement access to encrypted technology, if they were able to get a warrant. \xc2\xa0Senators Burr and Feinstein said now they\xe2\x80\x99re actually drafting this legislation and they hope to introduce it in March. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, has the White House been involved, or do you plan to be involved in the drafting of that legislation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the extent of the conversations on this issue. \xc2\xa0Obviously, this is an issue that our policymakers here at the White House and across the administration have spent a lot of time considering. \xc2\xa0And so I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out some consultation between the administration and Capitol Hill as members of the Senate who are interested in this issue try to develop helpful legislation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll want to play a constructive role in that process. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point to what extent administration officials have been consulted about that bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0In theory, are you very supportive of the legislation? I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of talked about a sweet spot between Apple not deciding and the White House, or the administration not deciding. \xc2\xa0In this case, Congress and the courts would be deciding. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been iffy before on if you\xe2\x80\x99d support an encryption. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if -- acknowledging that the specifics of the bill aren\xe2\x80\x99t out -- if this, in general, is something that you guys can get behind.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, as you point out, we have previously been quite skeptical of legislative handling of this particular matter. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll engage constructively with those members of the Senate who are interested in this issue. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point whether or not this will result in a piece of legislation that we will embrace. \xc2\xa0But I feel confident in telling you that there will be consultation between senior administration officials and the senators who are writing this bill.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, in the blog post from the President this morning, he said we are -- in the weeks ahead, we will see a decision on his nominee. \xc2\xa0Did that mean to suggest that we are weeks away from a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that that necessarily provided a whole lot of insight, though, into the President\xe2\x80\x99s timeline. \xc2\xa0We previously noted that the President nominated Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan about a month or so after the previous vacancies occurred in 2009 and 2010, respectively. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a new timeline to lay out here, but certainly \xe2\x80\x9cin the weeks ahead\xe2\x80\x9d language would be consistent with previous timelines. \xc2\xa0But it also could foreshadow a slightly shorter timeline or even somewhat longer timeline. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That was helpful. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You know the questions are just going to get worse and worse. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But two weeks into this, what you\xe2\x80\x99re signaling then is that the President is just not in a place, not only information-wise, but perhaps, given the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments today with the press, that he needs maybe to lay a little bit more groundwork politically. \xc2\xa0It seems like the strategy is take your time; go slow and steady, emphasizing how much of a quick reaction you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing on Capitol Hill from Republicans. \xc2\xa0Do you mean to emphasize that contrast?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to emphasize is two principles that I would acknowledge are in some tension. \xc2\xa0The first is, there is ample time left in this term, left in the President\xe2\x80\x99s final term in office. \xc2\xa0There is also ample time before the beginning of the next Supreme Court term in October for the President to carefully consider a nominee, put that nominee forward, for that individual to get a fair hearing and a timely yes-or-no vote. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve noted that over the last 40 years or so, about the average time frame for a Supreme Court nominee to go from nomination to confirmation --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is anything but average when it comes to the political firestorm you\xe2\x80\x99re looking that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That average time frame is about 67 days. \xc2\xa0And I would acknowledge, as I did with Darlene, that what we have seen from Republicans is rather -- is unprecedented. \xc2\xa0Not just rather unprecedented; it is genuinely unprecedented. \xc2\xa0And that said -- the President alluded to this in the Oval Office -- the Constitution doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include any exceptions for election years. \xc2\xa0The expectation of our Founders and the expectations of the American people are that the United States Senate will do its job, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year. \xc2\xa0And particularly in this era of what\xe2\x80\x99s often described as the permanent campaign, it seems like you could use this as a permanent excuse; that you could say, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s just another election around the corner.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is, by spending more time focused on elections and less time focused on constitutional responsibilities, Republicans in the United States Senate risk politicizing a branch of the United States government that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be insulated from politics. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is part of the stakes here.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, the other part of -- the other stakes involved here are the fact that we have a Supreme Court right now that is functioning with a vacancy. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not how the Founders intended. \xc2\xa0And it certainly, again, is inconsistent with the expectations of the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you said that there\xe2\x80\x99s a risk of politicizing the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0Do you mean to suggest as well that the President is not looking for the political affiliations of potential nominees? \xc2\xa0Would he be willing to appoint a Republican?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President laid out in his SCOTUS \xc2\xa0-- in his blog, on the SCOTUSblog today -- some of my colleagues have been joking that it\xe2\x80\x99s the POTUS blog on the SCOTUSblog -- \xc2\xa0but the President made clear in that presentation exactly the criteria that he intends to use to select a nominee. \xc2\xa0And you are right that there is no reference to a nominee\xe2\x80\x99s political affiliation. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no reference to which candidates they have previously supported in the political process. \xc2\xa0There is no reference to the political party that he or she has joined. \xc2\xa0The President is focused on criteria that, frankly, is more important, and that is an individual\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications and their experience and their view of the law. \xc2\xa0That will take precedence over any sort of political consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So, in theory, yes, he would consider a Republican for this job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think the accurate way to say it is that the President is not going to -- when the President gets to a stage -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he will get here -- where he\xe2\x80\x99s interviewing nominees or potential nominees in a conversation, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to ask them which party primary they vote in.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d probably know.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99d know, going into the meeting -- no?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not necessarily.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, if he were sitting down with a certain GOP governor --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Oh, I see what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying. \xc2\xa0Well, I guess in some situations, you\xe2\x80\x99re right, that may be a little more obvious that in others.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you said interviews right there. \xc2\xa0No interviews have actually been held yet with --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No interviews have been held at this point. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer that question because I raised it. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99ll make a public acknowledgement when those sorts of interviews have been conducted.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one on Syria, if I could. \xc2\xa0You said you\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to discuss military options as a potential plan B. \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPlan B\xe2\x80\x9d was a phrased used by the Secretary of State, at least twice so far, publicly. \xc2\xa0So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t simply speculative; it was from the administration. \xc2\xa0So is there or is there not a plan B?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the point that I was making to Ayesha is that we are focused on trying to bring about the successful implementation of the understanding about a cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0That is certainly the focus of Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts and it\xe2\x80\x99s the focal point of all of the work that\xe2\x80\x99s going on as a part of our work in Syria. \xc2\xa0Again, the cessation of hostilities does not apply to our ongoing military efforts against ISIL. \xc2\xa0Those efforts continue, and they will continue unabated. \xc2\xa0But when it comes to this diplomatic track, our focus right now is on trying to get this cessation of hostilities implemented, and that we navigate the early potholes in the road that we\xe2\x80\x99re sure to encounter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re unwilling to discuss a plan B, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not unwilling to entertain a possibility of military option? \xc2\xa0Because many would say, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99d be shocked if the administration would consider a military option, given that consistently the administration has been against any kind of military option in Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Right. \xc2\xa0A lot of our critics, or at least sort of the armchair quarterbacks have suggested that a plan B should be considered that would include some sort of military option. \xc2\xa0And I think the case that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to make here is that we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on trying to implement the cessation of hostilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe reason that I\xe2\x80\x99m not ruling out a plan B generally is because you would expect the administration to take responsible steps around contingency planning. \xc2\xa0We do that on essentially every policy question that the President faces, both foreign and domestic. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a discussion about potential contingencies, but I am suggesting that those kinds of discussions are not the focus of our attention right now. \xc2\xa0What is the focus of our attention is the successful implementation of a cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Less than two weeks ago, the Vice President was on the phone with the popular-elected President of Ukraine, Poroshenko. They discussed the political importance of the Minsk agreement, hostilities still raging in the eastern part of that country, and their effort together to root out any kind of corruption, et cetera. \xc2\xa0Might the President -- since he has been meeting with some leaders to bring more openness in his last part of his administration, might he consider a visit to Ukraine in this last year of his administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates about the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the situation in Ukraine is something that has -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been something that the administration has been working on quite a bit lately. \xc2\xa0And obviously, Vice President Biden had the opportunity to travel to Ukraine at the end of last year. \xc2\xa0And I think Vice President Biden, probably more than anyone at senior levels of the administration, has been invested in trying to bring about the resolution in Ukraine that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch of that has been blunted by the refusal of the Russians to implement their part of the Minsk agreements. \xc2\xa0We have seen the Ukrainians take some important steps. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen the Ukrainians put in place some important reforms that will be beneficial to their longer-term success. \xc2\xa0But right now, the biggest problem is the continued willingness of the Russians and the separatists in eastern Ukraine that they back to flout the obligations and commitments that they made in the Minsk agreement. \xc2\xa0And even as Ukraine is facing some significant challenges, they can continue to rely on the United States to be there to support them as they navigate this difficult situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve said lawmakers aren\xe2\x80\x99t fulfilling their responsibility when it comes to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee. \xc2\xa0But under the Constitution, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s only responsibility is to give advice and consent on the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee. \xc2\xa0Clearly, Senate Republicans are opting not to consent. But just to be clear, do you feel that they are defying their constitutional responsibility, or simply breaking precedent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a little of both -- both when you consider that every nominee that was put forward by a President since 1875 that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t later withdrawn by that President has received a hearing and/or a vote in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0It may even go back farther than that, but that\xe2\x80\x99s essentially as far back as our records went. \xc2\xa0So I think that is an indication of how their actions are not consistent with more than 120 years of precedent here. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat\xe2\x80\x99s also true is that Republicans, in offering up an excuse, often suggest that, oh, well, there\xe2\x80\x99s an 80-year precedent of not confirming Supreme Court nominees in an election year. \xc2\xa0The fact is, that\xe2\x80\x99s not correct either. \xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy was confirmed by a Democratic majority in the United States Senate in 1988, and Justice Kennedy was a nominee of President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s. \xc2\xa0So it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that Justice Kennedy was confirmed in a presidential election year, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that he was confirmed in the final year of President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office; it\xe2\x80\x99s that Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Democrats in the Senate, even though he\xe2\x80\x99d been appointed by, or nominated by a Republican President. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I know that the letter that was circulated by Republicans on the Judiciary Committee yesterday got a lot of attention. \xc2\xa0I think what also merits some attention is that two of the 11 people that signed that letter were people who actually voted for Justice Kennedy to confirm him in a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a little irony about this whole thing. I think it is why Republicans are going to continually be evaluating whether or not the unreasonable, obstructionist precedent-breaking posture that they have adopted is one that they will sustain over the course of the next 11 months. \xc2\xa0I think that will be a difficult thing for them to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But do you feel they\xe2\x80\x99re defying that responsibility to give advice and consent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think for hundreds of years, the Senate has had a lot of clarity about what exactly their responsibilities are when it comes to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And those responsibilities are that the President nominates someone and the Senate offers their advice and consent. \xc2\xa0Senators don\xe2\x80\x99t think to themselves, when evaluating a nominee, \xe2\x80\x9cGee, is this the person that I would have picked?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Rather, what they do is they consider whether or not this is somebody that they are confident will serve in a lifetime appointment in the Supreme Court with honor and distinction. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President has had success the last two times that he has nominated Supreme Court justices, and nominating people that he was able to persuade Republicans would serve the country with honor and distinction -- and they have. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that\xe2\x80\x99s what the President will do this time in terms of the person that he puts forward. \xc2\xa0Hopefully, Republicans will be able to set politics aside and focus and prioritize their constitutional duties.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And any word back yet from Senator Grassley to the President\xe2\x80\x99s invitation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The last I heard, which is about 90 minutes ago, is that we had not yet heard directly from him about whether or not he would attend the meeting. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly hopeful that he will.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one question on the campaign. \xc2\xa0Now that Donald Trump has three of four contests, does the President feel or consider him to be the presumptive Republican nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I haven\'t asked the President that question. \xc2\xa0I think the President has weighed in I think pretty directly on his views about Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s chances if he is the Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that the President will, at this point, weigh in on his expectations about who will be the Republican nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulie.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Earlier today, when the President talked about the Supreme Court, he seemed to suggest -- you said he used the phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cthis will evolve over time.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he seemed to suggest that he thinks that once there\xe2\x80\x99s a nominee, a name out there, that he thinks that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible the Republicans will rethink their position. \xc2\xa0Did he mean to suggest that? \xc2\xa0And then also, it sort of would seem to point to him trying to figure out a nominee would be a consensus choice, rather than somebody the Republicans would look at as a liberal crusader or someone who would be a sop to the progressive base. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to draw that conclusion from what he said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s separate out those two things. \xc2\xa0You may have to remind me of the second question. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll focus on the first part. \xc2\xa0I think the fact of the matter is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually already seen a number of senators change their position on this issue. \xc2\xa0There are a number of senators who have come forward, initially declaring their openness to a vote or their openness to a committee hearing, or their opposition to a filibuster, and then to have walked that back after a conversation with the Republican leader in the Senate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ll have to explain that to their constituents why they seem to be listening more closely to what the Republican leader in the Senate tells them as opposed to following what the Constitution tells them to do. \xc2\xa0But I think we\'ve already seen an evolution in the position that some senators have taken, and so I certainly -- it would be inaccurate to suggest that the positions that have been adopted by Republicans in the Senate have been fixed. \xc2\xa0Some of them I guess it has, but certainly not all of them. \xc2\xa0And I think what is also true is that we also have seen some members of the Senate come forward and say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee should get a hearing. \xc2\xa0And so, if anything, there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for a hearing. \xc2\xa0And we\'re hopeful that that\'s what the Senate will do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he did seem to suggest that when they see the nominee and see that the nominee is, in his words, well qualified, they may change their position. \xc2\xa0And that does seem to suggest that he is going to pick a certain kind of nominee that Republicans would look at as someone who deserved a fair hearing. So is it fair to draw that conclusion from what he said?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\'t speculate at this point about who the President is going to choose. \xc2\xa0But we do have two relevant points of reference, and those are in the form of Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan. \xc2\xa0These were two women with unquestioned qualifications. \xc2\xa0They had different kinds of experience, but the kind of experience that would serve them well on the bench. \xc2\xa0The President put them forward, and they were supported by I think just about every Democrat and some Republicans. \xc2\xa0That is a bipartisan process. \xc2\xa0And I\'m confident that when the President makes a final decision the President will be able to make a forceful case that those individuals deserve at least the same kind of bipartisan support that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan got.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is he consulting with the Republicans who (inaudible) talk to about who they think should be considered? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I\'m not going to get into the details of their conversations. \xc2\xa0But obviously you would expect that there would be some discussion about who the President picks in those consultations. \xc2\xa0I will say that it is probably hard to have that conversation if the person on the other end of the phone has said that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to consider anyone. \xc2\xa0It sort of makes it hard to --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Even if they\xe2\x80\x99re sheepish about it? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, maybe even if they\xe2\x80\x99re sheepish about it, they\xe2\x80\x99re -- maybe if they\xe2\x80\x99re sheepish about it in public, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re a little bit more willing to discuss it privately. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have details of those calls to read out. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere\xe2\x80\x99s another element to your question that I\'m not sure I answered. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that was if it was fair to draw the conclusion from what you said that he was looking for a consensus pick. \xc2\xa0If he\xe2\x80\x99s looking for someone who Republicans would look at and say, this person deserves a hearing even though I said I\'m not going to grant a hearing -- that would seem to point us in the direction that the President is looking for a moderate or someone who would be seen as acceptable to Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what I would try to sort of distill here, is that -- again, the requirement of the United States Senate is not to only vote for the person that you, yourself, would have chosen to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0So I\'m confident, for example, that at least some of the Republicans who ended up voting for Justice Sotomayor probably had someone higher than her on their own personal list. \xc2\xa0That\'s okay. \xc2\xa0That\'s a perfectly reasonable position. \xc2\xa0But that\'s not what the Constitution requires. \xc2\xa0What the Constitution requires is determining whether or not this is an individual who can serve the country with honor and distinction -- do they have the qualifications necessary to serve on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the criteria they used, and that was the criteria they used in making the decision to support Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think we\'re realistic about the fact that whoever the President puts forward, even if this is the most nonpartisan person and the most insightful legal thinker in history, the person is not going to get 100 votes in the United States Senate. We\'re realistic about that. \xc2\xa0And the President has acknowledged that politics have been injected in this process. \xc2\xa0And particularly people like Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio, if they\xe2\x80\x99re still running for president at the time, that\'s going to make it an even more complicated vote for them. \xc2\xa0The President understands that firsthand. \xc2\xa0So that\'s understandable.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe question is, is the institution of the United States Senate prepared to act and function in a way that the American people expect? \xc2\xa0Right now it\'s not. \xc2\xa0But will that change over time and will that change once there is a nominee put forward that has indisputable qualifications? \xc2\xa0Hopefully. \xc2\xa0But we\'ll see. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just about a week ago, when the President was traveling and he was talking about this when asked, he use words like venom and rancor, saying we\'ve almost become accustomed to the obstructionism of Republicans. \xc2\xa0But today, it just seemed like there was a markedly different tone. \xc2\xa0He used words like sympathetic, saying he understands the pressure and the posture, saying he recognizes the politics are difficult. \xc2\xa0Why this sort of change in tone there? \xc2\xa0Is he kind of coming around to seeing why this is possible? \xc2\xa0Because, like I said, a week ago it was all this is obstructionist, and this keeps happening, and this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President did make the observation even when he was on the road that this is a process that has been subjected to politics and that it was going to be impossible to extract all politics out of the situation, but that what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on is making sure that the institution of the United States Senate functions as the American people and as the Constitution expect.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, you\'re right, though, that the Senate is not off to a good start on this. \xc2\xa0Refusing the courtesy of a visit with the President\xe2\x80\x99s potential nominee? \xc2\xa0That\'s certainly not the spirit that either the Founders of the country expected; I also don\'t think it\'s the spirit that most Americans would expect. \xc2\xa0They elected members of Congress to come to Washington, D.C., fulfill their constitutional responsibilities and do the work of the American people. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd allowing a Supreme Court vacancy to extend on for more than a year I don\'t think fits anybody\xe2\x80\x99s description of members of the Senate doing their job. \xc2\xa0And particularly, announcing this reflexive opposition just hours after Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death and even before the President has had an opportunity to put someone forward so that their qualifications can be evaluated I think again is more evidence of how politicized this process has been.</p>\n<p>\n\tI noted in some of the coverage yesterday that Senator McConnell apparently paid a visit yesterday to the House Freedom Caucus. \xc2\xa0It\'s unclear if they met at Tortilla Coast. \xc2\xa0I know that is a frequent watering hole for some members of that caucus. \xc2\xa0But I think the fact that Senator McConnell requested the visit, that this was the first time he\xe2\x80\x99d ever addressed the group, and that members of his staff at least told a couple of reporters that he was pleased with the reception that he got might be an indication that politics is looming rather large here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd again, I think it\'s pretty clear that the previous Tortilla Coast gambit that was employed in the House wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a successful strategy, and hopefully, those kinds of tactics have not metastasized to the United States Senate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It sounds like the President is no longer harshly criticizing Republicans and he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, I\'m sympathetic, I understand, I know where it\'s coming from -- is he trying a different tact? \xc2\xa0Is he thinking that this might help things along, given that this is one day after Republicans basically said, hell, no, we\'re not doing this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think this is a reflection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term view. \xc2\xa0The President is not going to announce who his nominee is tomorrow. \xc2\xa0This isn\'t going to play out in the next 24 hours. \xc2\xa0As the SCOTUSblog points out today, this is a process that\'s going to play out at least over a couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0And the good news is we do have ample time. \xc2\xa0We do have time for the President to make a decision, to nominate someone, and there will be ample time, considering recent precedent, for the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to get a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So who was the President trying to reach in this SCOTUSblog? \xc2\xa0Why did he want to do that in that venue?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The goal here is to help all of you, but also the American people, understand exactly what kind of criteria he\xe2\x80\x99s evaluating as he contemplates who should fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And so that\'s why he sort of walks through the kind of qualifications and experience and temperament that he would like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So when he\xe2\x80\x99s saying that he recognizes the politics behind what Republicans are doing now, and he said the easier thing to do is to give into the extreme voices of the party, and in fact, when he went for a filibuster against Alito, was he then giving into the more extreme voices in his own party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President acknowledged that he regretted the vote because of the role that politics played there. \xc2\xa0The difference in that situation, though, is it was already well-known at the time that the Senate was prepared to act on Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s nomination and that he had sufficient support to be confirmed. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that just playing politics then? \xc2\xa0Is that why the President understands this so well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it\'s why the President regrets the vote. \xc2\xa0But again, that is different than taking the kind of action that knowingly disrupts the ability of the United States Senate to perform their institutional and constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, I think the President acknowledged that he accepted some responsibility for this. \xc2\xa0But he also acknowledged why these two situations are different. \xc2\xa0And it certainly is a far cry from opposing President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nominee without even considering who that individual is. \xc2\xa0In fact, the President had some substantive objections to President Bush\xe2\x80\x99s nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I mean, you\'re making the argument that there are not \xc2\xa0-- I mean, it\'s obviously breaking precedent that they\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to take this up, if they do what they say they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do. \xc2\xa0But let\xe2\x80\x99s say they please the public and try not to make so many waves by taking it up, but then they\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to let it go through, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to vote this person in. \xc2\xa0Is there really any difference if that\'s just going to be the outcome?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it would be a notable difference for a couple of things. \xc2\xa0First is it would reflect a significant change in their position. \xc2\xa0Right now, you have the Senate Majority Leader saying that he won\'t even meet with that person. I don\'t know if that means that he\'ll just lock the office door that day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, if we got to a place where that nominee is treated with courtesy and respect, engages in the kinds of private, one-on-one meetings that have been taking place between Supreme Court nominees and United States senators for generations, and we see a public hearing where an individual testifies under oath about their qualifications for the job, and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have an opportunity to explore those views in public, on television for everyone to see, that is much more consistent with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional responsibility. \xc2\xa0And at that point, members of the Senate will then have to consider whether or not this person has succeeded in making the case that he or she has the proper credentials to serve in a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, again, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s relevant about this is, at that point, after a hearing has taken place, the American people will have some sort of opinion about this. \xc2\xa0And whether or not that has any influence over the opinion of individual senators I think remains to be seen. \xc2\xa0But the criteria that the President will choose is somebody who in a setting like I\'ve just described will be able to demonstrate that they are the best person for the job and that they can serve with honor and distinction on the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President also mentioned that, let\xe2\x80\x99s see if the American public thinks that they\xe2\x80\x99re well within the mainstream. \xc2\xa0So is it safe to assume that his nominee will be well within the mainstream?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think, based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in the Oval Office today, I think you can add that to the list of accurate descriptions of who the President will eventually choose.</p>\n<p>\n\tApril.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to go back to the Supreme Court process. \xc2\xa0Has the President met informally with people, just having conversations with some of the people, not necessarily formal interviews but just have like a meeting, hey, how are you doing, or just coming through?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0April, I\'m just not going to be able to provide that much granular insight into how this process is shaping up. \xc2\xa0It\'s still early on in the process. \xc2\xa0A final list has not been compiled at this point. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have any more detail to share beyond that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A finalist hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been made, but there is a list, as you have said, yourself. \xc2\xa0Now, with that list, is there a possibility that the President already knows many of these people on the list and may have already interacted before in the Oval Office and other places?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I wouldn\'t -- I don\'t have a lot of insight to share with you about who is on the list or even what kinds of people are on the list. \xc2\xa0I can say, as I\'ve said before, that just because people have been considered the previous time but not chosen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disqualify them from being considered this time. \xc2\xa0So my point is it certainly is possible that the President could be familiar with the qualifications and background of a potential nominee that he\xe2\x80\x99s considered in a previous round.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- that he already met those people in a previous round that are on the old list?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Some of them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that some of them he already has familiarity with that are on this list?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That certainly is possible. \xc2\xa0But again, I won\'t confirm who exactly is on the list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, how much does legacy play into this process? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the truth is that I would expect that historians will look back on this moment, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be evaluating not just the performance of the President but also the performance of the Senate. \xc2\xa0And I think the President has found that over his first seven years in office, that the way that he\xe2\x80\x99s most likely to be proud of what he did in his eight years in the White House is by focusing on the task in front of him and making the best possible decision. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the kind of criteria that he\'ll use in choosing this nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, I just wanted to ask about something that you said in your opening remarks. \xc2\xa0You we\'re talking about the unbeaten record in trade disputes. \xc2\xa0I\'m trying to square that with what happened at WTO with the country of origin labels.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0These are 20 enforcement actions that have been brought to the WTO by the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Strictly enforcement actions.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Enforcement actions brought by the United States. \xc2\xa0And the reason this is relevant is because there are concerns by some opponents of TPP who suggest that the President somehow has not been as aggressive as he should be in looking out for the interests of the United States when it comes to international trade. \xc2\xa0But the fact of the matter is the United States has brought more enforcement actions to the WTO than any other member of the WTO, and each one that has been decided has been resolved in our favor. \xc2\xa0So that\'s an indication not just of how rigorous the administration has been in putting forward enforcement actions to protect the American economy, it also shows that we\'ve been successful in protecting the U.S. economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Critics of TPP have also raised concerns that the U.S. would be less able to enforce its own rules about standards, where our meat is raised, that sort of thing, if we were subject to an international body. \xc2\xa0And that was sort of borne out in the WTO decision on the country of origin.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, some of these details are complicated -- I don\'t know that I can get into the details of it. \xc2\xa0I think the first observation I would have at least when it comes to the example of agricultural products, the American Farm Bureau is a strong supporter and has endorsed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that just as a political favor to President Barack Obama. \xc2\xa0In fact, on most political issues, they come down on the opposite side of President Obama. \xc2\xa0But in this case, they recognize that the U.S. agricultural industry has much to gain from leveling the playing field with countries in Southeast Asia -- or Asia and the Asia Pacific.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can\'t speak to the specific country of origin labeling ruling that you described there, but if we need to explore that more I\'m sure we can find somebody who knows a lot more about it than I do.</p>\n<p>\n\tFelicia.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Iranian elections are on Friday. \xc2\xa0Do you have any comment on them, or anything you can share about what the administration is watching for?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t. \xc2\xa0At this point, I\xe2\x80\x99ve resisted -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve usually succeeded in resisting extensive commentary on the U.S. election. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly going to reserve judgment on the Iranian election at this point. \xc2\xa0But obviously, this is an opportunity for the Iranian people to make their voices heard. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the United States that will be watching. \xc2\xa0The world will be watching.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just listening to all the Supreme Court stuff, I think one thing I think we\xe2\x80\x99d agree on is that the American public is tired of all this partisanship and this back-and-forth and nothing getting done here, and all the acrimony back and forth. \xc2\xa0So why doesn\'t the President -- and you said, in terms of these meetings with Republicans and others and discussions he\xe2\x80\x99s doing, kind of the same thing he\xe2\x80\x99s done with Kagan and Sotomayor process -- why doesn\'t he adopt a different process? \xc2\xa0Why doesn\'t -- to follow up on Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question -- tell the public, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find a consensus candidate? \xc2\xa0We won\xe2\x80\x99t make this divisive, and be transparent and open about it, instead of all this \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to do my job, they should do their job.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about how this is one of his biggest regrets ever in office of this rancor and partisanship. \xc2\xa0So why doesn\'t he try a different approach that\'s transparent, that is a consensus so that the country doesn\'t have to suffer through months and months of all this back-and-forth?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Ron, I actually have a really direct answer to this question, which is it is impossible to find consensus when they Republicans in the United States Senate said that they won\xe2\x80\x99t support anybody, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even consider anybody, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even offer up a courtesy meeting with anybody that the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0So I --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you think that\'s going to happen? \xc2\xa0Or do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s bluster? \xc2\xa0Do you think that\'s -- in this a poker game, that\'s the first -- you take them seriously?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it was Leader McConnell himself who indicated that he very rarely finds himself off message. \xc2\xa0So I believe that he meant what he said. \xc2\xa0I certainly have no reason to doubt it. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the right position. \xc2\xa0I certainly don\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a position that most Americans support. \xc2\xa0I do think there\xe2\x80\x99s some evidence, based on his meeting with the House Freedom Caucus, that politics are playing too large of a role here. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, he\xe2\x80\x99s the Senate Majority Leader and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to determine what he believes is the most effective way to lead the Senate. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe questions now for him are different than they used to be. \xc2\xa0He was a Senate majority -- minority leader for a long time, and he found that -- or at least he concluded that political obstruction was a useful political benefit for him. \xc2\xa0He saw that as his strategy and his road map for getting back into the majority. \xc2\xa0But, apparently, that\'s a strategy that he\xe2\x80\x99s chosen to continue to pursue.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s back to what they need to do and so on and so forth. \xc2\xa0Where does the White House see some compromise in all this? \xc2\xa0Although you don\'t want to perhaps tip your hand or show your cards because of this, again, endless game of partisanship, but is there some way to get out of this situation? Again, does the White House -- does the President have some idea, some approach that can be different, that can spare the country all this back-and-forth for another --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President certainly would like to try. \xc2\xa0But that\'s going to be hard to do when you have members of the United States Senate saying that they won\xe2\x80\x99t do courtesy visits with whomever the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0That\'s going to be hard to do when every Republican on the Judiciary Committee says that for the first time since 1875, they won\xe2\x80\x99t even hold a hearing for whomever the President puts forward. \xc2\xa0And this is even before the President has put forward a nominee. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to try to find some common ground until Republicans -- because this is the thing that I think is notable -- and I made this point yesterday -- this is not even a situation of Republicans saying that they object. \xc2\xa0This is Republicans saying that they even refuse to consider. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for them to make the case that they\'re doing their jobs. \xc2\xa0Again, for most Americans, they\'re showing up to work not even considering any alternatives. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that\'s part of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s job description.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And you\'re not getting any signals privately that that\'s not real?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President made the observation in the Oval Office that some people might be a little sheepish about this. \xc2\xa0So again -- but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see. \xc2\xa0These are individuals who have been elected by states across the country to serve in six-year terms -- not five-year, one-month terms -- but six-year terms in the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0Many of them had to go through hotly contested campaigns both in a primary and a general election to get there. \xc2\xa0Many of them have been reelected multiple times. \xc2\xa0These are serious people. \xc2\xa0They understand what\xe2\x80\x99s required to make serious decisions. \xc2\xa0They understand the stakes that are involved when you\'re considering a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0They understand the decisions that are made in the United States Senate have an impact on the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just lastly, why did the President speak out today? Nine minutes -- that\'s a very -- and it seemed like he was prepared. \xc2\xa0He was ready -- not that he\xe2\x80\x99s not ever unprepared -- but he seemed ready for that, he seemed to want to take that moment. \xc2\xa0It seemed planned. \xc2\xa0It seemed that he thought about it a lot to spend nine minutes talking about this. \xc2\xa0Why today? \xc2\xa0Was it the flat refusal to have meetings? \xc2\xa0Was there something in particular that someone said to him, or something that he was aware of?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what this reflects, Ron, is -- I noticed that it was a rather lengthy answer, as well; detailed some might say. \xc2\xa0I think this is a reflection that the President has spent a lot of time thinking about this. \xc2\xa0This is an indication the President did do his homework over the weekend when he was considering the materials that have been put together by his legal team. \xc2\xa0This is an indication that he has had multiple conversations with members in both parties on Capitol Hill about the proper way forward.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think this is a good illustration of just how seriously the President takes this constitutional responsibility of his. \xc2\xa0And I think you can expect that seriousness of purpose to continue throughout this process.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You said not in 24 hours and not in a couple of weeks\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t-- meaning two weeks, or 14 days? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So can we draw those lines?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0When I said a couple of weeks, I knew I was going to regret it. \xc2\xa0I would encourage you not to over-read into that. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was trying to read exactly. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0And what I would refer to is the President\xe2\x80\x99s words on SCOTUSblog today that in the coming weeks he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a decision to announce.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You can go back and do that fine line -- (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Exactly. \xc2\xa0But thank you for giving me the operation to clarify that. \xc2\xa0I do appreciate that.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I just want to sort of -- again, without sort of trying to have you say exactly who is on the list, how important would it be for the President to consider a female judge for the High Court?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has obviously appointed two distinguished, accomplished women to the Supreme Court in his first two years in office. \xc2\xa0But, again, I think the President will evaluate the nominees\xe2\x80\x99 credentials based on their record, based on their intellect, based on their experience. \xc2\xa0And the gender of this individual does not rate highly on the list.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me follow up by simply asking then, given the makeup of the Court currently, is it relevant at all that -- for the broad swath of history, there have been relatively few women on the High Court. \xc2\xa0And him now having appointed two, or nominated two, and having successfully two confirmed, would it not be important then for him to continue that trend to more equitably balance the Court? \xc2\xa0At least from that perspective, is that interesting at all to him? \xc2\xa0Is that a conversation that he\xe2\x80\x99s had?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the President will consider some women candidates. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\'t think that the gender of the nominee will drive the decision. \xc2\xa0What will drive the decision will be that individual\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications, their experience and their intellect, their ability to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States with honor and distinction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Any chance that the President will -- if he can\'t persuade Senator McConnell or Grassley or others to come here -- will he go to the Hill?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has certainly done that before. He\xe2\x80\x99s done meetings on Capitol Hill before. \xc2\xa0But in the aftermath of the last two Supreme Court vacancies, the President has convened a meeting in the Oval Office with the leaders of the Judiciary Committee, and he\xe2\x80\x99s interested in doing the same thing again. \xc2\xa0Senator Leahy from Vermont, who\xe2\x80\x99s the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, has agreed to that meeting. \xc2\xa0And so the meeting will take place. \xc2\xa0Hopefully Chairman Grassley will be there. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And do you have a readout of possibly when that might have happen?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t at this point, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep your apprised of that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll point out that the two previous times that the President convened these meetings, in both 2009 and 2010, the pool was allowed in there, and photographs were taken. And the President even made a brief statement to the pool at both circumstances. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- Tortilla Coast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, exactly. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, I just wanted to ask you about his conversation with the King today and the importance of the partnership in the fight against ISIL. \xc2\xa0There seems to be some sense that there\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreement within the administration about how best to go forward, in particular given Russia\xe2\x80\x99s previous disposition for breaking agreements, be they Minsk or others. \xc2\xa0How concerned is the President that even if a cease-fire is brokered that the Russians simply won\xe2\x80\x99t hold to it? \xc2\xa0And is there a rift within the administration at all at how best to go about applying more pressure on the Syrians and others to hopefully get this to stick?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can tell you there is unanimity of opinion inside the administration that successfully implementing a cessation of hostilities is the clearest and best way to advance our interests there. \xc2\xa0It will allow multiple things to happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFirst of all, it will give a boost to the ongoing but fledgling political transition process there. \xc2\xa0It will allow the freer flow of humanitarian assistance to areas of Syria that right now are hard to access because of the fighting. \xc2\xa0It also will refocus everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention on the counter-ISIL effort. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we have said for quite some time that Russia should stop taking strikes in Syria where there is little, if any, ISIL presence, and actually integrate their military efforts with the broader international coalition and actually start focusing their firepower on ISIL. \xc2\xa0That is why the cessation of hostilities has emerged as a priority. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\'re also pointing out something that is really important, which is that it requires the Russians to live up to what they\xe2\x80\x99ve committed to here, and that\'s a tall order. \xc2\xa0So that may be hard to do. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why I do anticipate that it will be a little bit of start-and-stop process at the beginning. \xc2\xa0But if over the course of several weeks, we can get that cessation of hostilities implemented, it will allow us to focus on the more important tasks at hand, like the political transition, the delivery of critically important humanitarian aid, and a renewed focus on the part of countries like Russia on actually succeeding in degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tGregory.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0I want to go back to Guantanamo Bay if I could. \xc2\xa0A lot of attention yesterday was on the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to close the facility outright by transferring detainees to U.S. soil. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of other things that he proposed, or said that he was -- the administration was already doing to -- for example, speed up the Periodic Review Board process, form the military commissions, et cetera. \xc2\xa0If, in fact, he -- if those Periodic Review Board hearings are completed by the end of the summer, as the President said, and if the current trends continue, a lot of human rights activists who are watching these cases said we could get down to perhaps a half dozen people who are not eligible for transfer to some third country -- if you can find third countries willing to make the security and humanitarian arrangements to take them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo then, in addition to the 10 military commissions, you\'ve got maybe a dozen or so hard-core, sort of indefinite detainees. I guess my question to you is would the President consider that victory? \xc2\xa0Would that be a substantial fulfillment of his campaign promises? \xc2\xa0Could he use maybe lower-level executive actions to extradite those or somehow find a place for those? \xc2\xa0Could we get to zero or near zero by the end of the President\xe2\x80\x99s term? \xc2\xa0And is that part of the strategy here to put legal, economic and sort of political pressure on Congress to say, hey, look, we only have a handful now of detainees, even more of an argument to close the facility?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me answer that in a couple different ways here. \xc2\xa0Transferring Gitmo detainees who, based on a careful review by the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team, are eligible for transfer continues to be a high priority. \xc2\xa0We have seen Congress interfere in that effort. \xc2\xa0For example, Congress has required 30-day notification and specific certification by the Secretary of Defense before those transfers can be commenced. \xc2\xa0That is a lot of red tape and a lot of bureaucracy that we have routinely complied with. \xc2\xa0And we\'re going to continue to do that work. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, it also depends upon -- as you point out -- the cooperation of our allies and partners. \xc2\xa0There are about 35 countries that have agreed to take Gitmo detainees. \xc2\xa0And so it will require further intensive, diplomatic work with those countries -- or maybe some others that haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken any yet -- to try to find an appropriate arrangement for the safe transfer of these individuals. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat will continue to be a priority. \xc2\xa0Even in the face of continued congressional obstruction, that\'s still going to be a priority. \xc2\xa0Primarily because, Gregory, as you point out, that is part of our strategy for closing the prison. \xc2\xa0What we\'re looking ahead to is an acknowledgement -- something that you also referred to -- which is that some of these individuals will not be deemed safe for transfer, and some of these individuals cannot be effectively prosecuted in our criminal justice system. \xc2\xa0And it means that these individuals will be subject to a law of war detention.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the case that we have made to Congress, and we\'re going to continue to make publicly -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it for seven years and we\'re going to keep making it -- is that we can do that, keep these individuals detained under law of war rules in the United States in a way that removes a potent symbol that is used by terrorists to recruit. \xc2\xa0And by bringing them to facilities that are here in the United States, we can actually detain them under the laws of war in a way that costs taxpayers a lot less money.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo when you consider those benefits, and when you consider the recommendations of the Secretary of Defense, this is a pretty easy policy decision. \xc2\xa0And again, we hear a lot of Republicans running around for President who say that they want to keep America safe, that they want to cut wasteful government spending, and that they want to follow the advice of our leaders at the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0That\'s exactly what the President is proposing to do with this plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\'s also why I think it\xe2\x80\x99s notable that there is bipartisan support for this plan. \xc2\xa0Certainly, President George W. Bush, a Republican, believes that the prison at Guantanamo Bay should be close. \xc2\xa0And I noted that earlier today, his Secretary of State, General Colin Powell, indicated his support for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. \xc2\xa0So this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a partisan issue. \xc2\xa0This is a situation where President Bush, President Obama, our leaders at the Pentagon, and others that have deep, respected experience on these issues all agree that this is worthwhile goal. \xc2\xa0And it could be completed this year if Congress doesn\'t prevent it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have a number in mind of how many would be subject to indefinite detention even if the President is able to go through all the steps that you just --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an estimate at this point. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the periodic review board is doing its work. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have prosecutors also evaluating whether or not these individuals could be successfully prosecuted. \xc2\xa0So those determinations -- the determinations by the review board and the determination by the prosecutors -- will have an impact on what the final number looks like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJared.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, does the President believe the Constitution prohibits senators from voting against a nominee to the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0What the President believe is that the Senate, as an institution, has a responsibility to continue to function and to make sure that the third branch of government can also continue to function as our Founders intended.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I pointed out, it is unprecedented in modern Supreme Court history for a single vacancy to have an important act on two different terms of the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And right now, if Republicans in the Senate follow through on their promise, that\xe2\x80\x99s the unprecedented result. \xc2\xa0And so the President\xe2\x80\x99s expectation is that the Senate, as an institution, will function to prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing -- and this sort of goes back to what Michelle was asking about -- the President is not suggesting that every ounce of politics needs to be drained out of this. \xc2\xa0Over the years, too much -- a lot of politics has built up. \xc2\xa0And the President is realistic about that and the President is realistic about the fact that that\xe2\x80\x99s more pronounced in an election year. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely understandable. \xc2\xa0We know that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be politics influencing this process. \xc2\xa0What we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to have is politics dictating this process. \xc2\xa0But yet, right now, that appears to be what\xe2\x80\x99s happening. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s not good for our system of government, and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not good for the one branch of government that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be most isolated and protected from the influence of partisan electoral politics.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President believe that the Constitution requires senators to meet with a Supreme Court nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, since 1875 --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking about the precedent. \xc2\xa0I understand that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of discussion about precedent and history. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the Constitution and what the President assesses -- the bare minimum requirements. \xc2\xa0Because, clearly, based on the politics, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve been arguing, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the bare minimum, unfortunately.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as the Constitution points out, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the Senate to offer the President advice and consent on his Supreme Court nominee. \xc2\xa0And it seems quite difficult to do that if you continue to refuse to even meet with that person. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that would be -- that their advice and consent would be particularly well informed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President acknowledge, then, senators\xe2\x80\x99 right to withhold consent from a nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t even named a nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking -- we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the basement, the bargain basement of what the Constitution requires. \xc2\xa0Is withholding a nominee -- withholding their approval or their consent from a nominee within each individual senator\xe2\x80\x99s right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, Jared, maybe some of the questions that you\xe2\x80\x99re asking could be directed to a constitutional scholar. \xc2\xa0I think everybody in this room, and I think many of the people watching understand the expectations that the Senate has based on their constitutional duty to provide the President advice and consent on his Supreme Court nominee.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking if the White House believes, as many in the Senate have claimed, that they have a right to withhold that consent. \xc2\xa0Do you agree with their assessment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think my assessment is that most people think that it is unreasonable for Republicans in the United States Senate to say that they will not support any nominee that the President puts forward, to refuse to meet with any nominee that the President puts forward, to refuse to hold hearings about that -- for that nominee for the first time since 1875.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, the American people have an expectation that members of the United States Senate are going to do their job. \xc2\xa0And again, maybe part of their job description does involve making a decision after careful thought and consideration. \xc2\xa0After listening to hearings, after meeting in private with this individual, maybe they determine that part of their job means voting no. \xc2\xa0But again, their job does not require them to choose someone and only vote yes for someone who they believe is at the top of their own personal list. \xc2\xa0If the person that\xe2\x80\x99s at the top of their personal list is appointed to the Supreme Court, then they should run for President, if they want that responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think some of them are.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Some of them are. \xc2\xa0I would point out that they\xe2\x80\x99re not running for three-year terms, they\xe2\x80\x99re running for four-year terms. \xc2\xa0Because whoever is elected President in 2016 will take office in January of 2017, and for the next four years will have the constitutional responsibility to appoint individuals to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the way that our system has worked for more than 200 years. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I certainly would expect that people who claim to be passionate defenders of the United States Constitution would be passionate advocates for that argument -- unless politics is interfering. \xc2\xa0And I suspect that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any reaction to Senate Majority Leader McConnell yesterday saying that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t commit to an up or down vote on the next President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to the Supreme Court?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that I saw that part of his answer. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, in general that, again, what we are seeing is an unprecedented escalation in the politicization of the Supreme Court nomination process. \xc2\xa0And that, in the view of this President, is not a good thing. \xc2\xa0Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that for this process to succeed that we need to drain every element of politics out of the equation, but it does mean that Republicans \xc2\xa0-- who are in the majority, who worked hard to gain the majority of the Senate, who vowed when they took the majority of the Senate to get Congress moving again -- the President does have an expectation that the Senate, as an institution, will fulfill their responsibility, which means giving the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee a timely hearing -- a fair hearing and a timely up or down vote.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any reaction to President Erdogan saying that basically the YPG should not be protected in the cease-fire?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That is not what the government of Turkey committed to in the context of the cessation of hostilities. \xc2\xa0So our expectation is that the understanding has been reached. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a framework for implementing it. \xc2\xa0We do anticipate that there will be some bumps along the way. \xc2\xa0It will not be a smooth implementation process. \xc2\xa0But we have now seen public commitments on the part of the Russians and the Syrian government, most importantly, about the steps that they will take to implement this understanding.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0President Erdogan seems to be backing away from that, and he obviously represents the government. \xc2\xa0So would there be consequences imposed by the United States on Turkey if they were to go ahead and violate the cease-fire by targeting the YPG?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, Turkey is a NATO ally, and it is an ally that can count on the reliable support of the United States of America, particularly in a time frame in which the people of Turkey have been subjected to terrorist attacks on their soil. \xc2\xa0Their concern about their national security is understandable. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut the best way to address that concern is for us to address the longstanding political chaos that is fomenting so much violence on the other side of their border with Syria. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s a problem. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the many important reasons that the United States has been so deeply engaged in this diplomatic political effort, because of the negative impact it\xe2\x80\x99s having on the broader region, especially on our NATO ally in Turkey.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So there would be no negative consequences for Turkey if they defied your wishes and continued to strike the YPG?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our expectation is that everybody who signed up for the cessation of hostilities understanding will fulfill --will meet their commitments. \xc2\xa0And our concern right now is most directly focused on the Russians and on the Syrian regime. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve made some important commitments, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to expect them to meet them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, this process is going to be bumpy, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean in the first few days, I mean at least in the first few weeks. \xc2\xa0But with some perseverance, we are hopeful that we can implement a cessation of hostilities that will pave the way for advancing the political transition inside of Syria, for speeding the flow of humanitarian assistance, and for an intense focus being placed on our effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could a cease-fire actually survive if Turkey isn\xe2\x80\x99t playing ball?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, our expectation is that those who have made commitments in the context of reaching an understanding about a cessation of hostilities, that they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep those commitments. \xc2\xa0And we have that expectation for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t2:45 P.M.
