EDT</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Hey, guys. \xc2\xa0We got some new additions here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Good morning. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m joined today by John Brennan, who has an announcement to make about our efforts in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Thank you, Bill. \xc2\xa0Good morning, everyone.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Today United States forces in Iraq announced that the United States now has less than 50,000 troops in Iraq. \xc2\xa0This reaches the goal that was set by the President last February as part of his efforts to responsibly draw down our forces from Iraq and transition to Iraqi security forces the responsibility for security in that country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement comes one week in advance of the end of August, the date that was set for the formal shift in the U.S. mission in Iraq from combat to support of Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 On September 1st, our mission will shift and we will have a change in command in Iraq. \xc2\xa0And as Bill said, the President -- or as Bill will be saying -- the President will be making a speech to mark this important transition.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 After September 1st, the United States will have a different mission, one of advising and assisting Iraqi security forces, joining the Iraqis in targeted counterterrorism operations and protecting U.S. troops and civilians who remain in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Since the President took office, we have removed some 94,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, which represents a truly remarkable achievement for our military and for the country. \xc2\xa0We honor the service of all of our men and women in Iraq. \xc2\xa0We welcome home those who have returned in recent weeks. \xc2\xa0And we honor the service and memory of all those brave Americans who gave their life in the pursuit of peace and security in Iraq. \xc2\xa0We also support those who continue to serve in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way in Iraq, Afghanistan and throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 This drawdown also demonstrates the capability of the Iraqi security forces who have increasingly moved into the lead in providing security for the country. \xc2\xa0Within Iraq, there continue to be acts of violence as terrorist groups, chiefly al Qaeda in Iraq, try to derail Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s progress. \xc2\xa0But although these terrorists continue to kill innocent Iraqis, they have failed to ignite sectarian violence, and violence continues to be at a reduced level.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Over the last several months, we have also seen important blows dealt against al Qaeda in Iraq. \xc2\xa0Its top two leadership figures were taken off the battlefield in Iraqi-led counterterrorism operations. \xc2\xa0And a substantial number of its leadership has been removed in a steady campaign that has been waged to degrade al Qaeda in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s capability.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We can anticipate that al Qaeda in Iraq will try to argue that they have been successful, but they are wrong. \xc2\xa0We are reducing our footprint in Iraq under our terms, and through a transition to over 600,000 Iraqi security forces who have proven up to the task. \xc2\xa0Meanwhile, al Qaeda in Iraq has been degraded as a terrorist organization.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Our efforts to draw down in Iraq are a critical part of our transition to full Iraqi responsibility, in line with the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of supporting an Iraq that is sovereign, stable and self-reliant.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re also part of our broader national security approach. \xc2\xa0By drawing down our forces, we have reduced the strain on our forces and refocused our resources on taking the fight to al Qaeda around the world.Yet even as we have increased our commitment in Afghanistan with roughly 98,000 troops now serving there, we have still managed to reduce by roughly 30,000 the total number of troops we have serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>If I also could mention one other point. \xc2\xa0We are saddened today by the loss of life that was tragically -- that tragically occurred as a result of a bombing by al-Shabaab in Mogadishu. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s our understanding that there were over 30 killed, including six parliamentarians.This is a particularly outrageous act during the Islamic month of Ramadan. \xc2\xa0And al-Shabaab\xe2\x80\x99s vision for Africa stands in sharp contrast to the vision of the overwhelming majority of Africans, like those who participated in the President\xe2\x80\x99s youth forum, that the future that Africa -- that these Africans desire and that the continent itself so richly deserves.</p>\n<p>The United States will continue to partner with those who oppose terrorism, extremism and violence in all forms, and will continue to work very closely with those in Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa in Somalia, who are interested in ensuring that Africa can build and realize its full potential and prosperity for all Africans.Thank you.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d just add to what John said. \xc2\xa0The President will of course be making a speech on the 31st. \xc2\xa0Just to short-circuit some of your questions, the venue and time has not yet been determined. \xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99ll of course talk about the importance of the milepost that that day is as we change missions in Iraq. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the bravery and the courageousness of American soldiers who\xe2\x80\x99ve fought there. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about what our policy will be in Iraq moving forward, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about how that effort relates to and works with our fight against al Qaeda in Afghanistan and all around the world. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And so with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take your questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On this speech, can you talk about how the President will balance recognizing signs of progress with avoiding a \xe2\x80\x9cmission accomplished\xe2\x80\x9d moment?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, the President laid out a pretty specific objective in his Camp Lejeune speech in February of 2010*. \xc2\xa0He said he wanted to make sure that Iraqis could take care of their own security, that we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving a democracy that\xe2\x80\x99s stable. \xc2\xa0And so he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about those things and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done to achieve those objectives. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get too far ahead of what his exact message is going to be as it\xe2\x80\x99s a week out yet.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Can you talk about the stem cells ruling, what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0The President said very plainly when he laid out his stem cell policy that this is important lifesaving -- potentially lifesaving research that could have an impact on millions of Americans and people all around the world. \xc2\xa0He thinks that we need to do research. \xc2\xa0He put forward stringent ethical guidelines, and he thinks that his policy is the right one.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still reviewing the decision from this judge, but what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen so far, from what we can tell, this would also stop the research that President Bush had allowed to go forward early in his presidency. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re exploring all possible avenues to make sure that we can continue to do this critical lifesaving research.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does it appear that it might require legislation to be able to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing all possibilities.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Alister.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, thanks. \xc2\xa0On the economy, there was another very sort of weak housing number, and that has raised concerns among some economists of the outlook for the economy. \xc2\xa0Is the administration concerned the U.S. is heading towards a double-dip recession?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President is doing everything that we think is appropriate to continue moving the economy in the right direction. \xc2\xa0There is more that we can be doing. \xc2\xa0He thinks that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from a place where the economy was deep in crisis to a place where we\xe2\x80\x99re actually growing, where private sector jobs are being created.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We obviously saw the numbers, and it shows that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more work yet to do. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not an economist, I can\xe2\x80\x99t really speak to when a recession starts or ends.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And anything -- any update on the timing of the announcement of a new head of the CEA or the Consumer Financial Protection board?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Nope, not yet.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0For Mr. Brennan, or for you, Mr. Burton. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, General Odierno appeared to leave the door open for a continued mission beyond 2011, the date by which the President has set for all U.S. troops, including the 50,000 there at this moment, to be withdrawn. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could flesh that out a little bit. \xc2\xa0Under what scenario would U.S. troops stay in Iraq beyond 2011?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, just real fast, we have -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a commitment in the SOFA to have our troops out by the end of 2011, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment we intend to keep.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And so there\xe2\x80\x99s no scenario by which U.S. troops would stay?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into some hypothetical, but there is an agreement in place, and the President is a person who makes a promise and keeps it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0For you, Bill. \xc2\xa0Mr. Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Cleveland today calling for the resignation of Mr. Summers and Secretary Geithner -- your reaction, please.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, for starters -- I have taken a look at that speech, and what was most surprising was that -- was his full-throated defense of what is indefensible, and that\xe2\x80\x99s tax breaks for companies who ship jobs overseas. \xc2\xa0At a time when we need to be creating jobs here at home, Mr. Boehner focused on helping corporations who aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually creating jobs here at home. \xc2\xa0He attacked an effort to keep teachers in schools and firefighters and cops on the street, derisively calling them government jobs. \xc2\xa0Well, to the President, those are folks who are helping to ensure the future of our country by educating our kids, and the safety of our streets, and also are important jobs locally, to make sure that we are keeping our economy as vibrant and growing as it possibly can be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is -- he\xe2\x80\x99s talked a lot about this notion that the Republicans drove our economy into a ditch, and the irony here is that Boehner would fire the very people who helped to make the tough decisions, who helped to do the hard work to get our economy moving in the right direction again.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There was -- during the last six months of the Bush administration, we lost some 4 million jobs. \xc2\xa0Millions more were lost throughout this recession. \xc2\xa0Now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing positive job growth. \xc2\xa0Now we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the economy growing. And of course the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied with the pace at which it\xe2\x80\x99s moving, but he does think that we need to keep moving with the policies that helped to get us out of the crisis and not go back to the ones that got us into it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On housing, President Obama originally said that his housing program -- he wanted it to help 3 or 4 million Americans keep their homes. \xc2\xa0Less than half a million -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about 420,000 -- have gotten the permanent housing loan modifications, and Treasury has since backed off the 3 to 4 million number. \xc2\xa0This is a $75 billion program. \xc2\xa0How many Americans does the administration think it will help?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific number for you. \xc2\xa0I would check with Treasury on their latest numbers.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question. \xc2\xa0They don\xe2\x80\x99t -- they have been reluctant to answer the question as to how many millions of Americans -- or hundreds of thousands -- they want the housing program to help. \xc2\xa0And so I\xe2\x80\x99m asking the White House.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Okay, I understand. \xc2\xa0This is obviously a Treasury program, and I would direct you over there to get the specifics of how they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with these specific issues around the program. \xc2\xa0Any economic program that we put into place we\xe2\x80\x99re constantly reviewing, seeing if there\xe2\x80\x99s ways that we can make it move faster, make it work more efficiently, make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re helping as many people as we possibly can at the least cost to the American taxpayer. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously tracking this very closely, and I would encourage you to stay in contact with them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask them, but does the President think this program is a success, this $75 billion program that has fallen way short of the President\xe2\x80\x99s goals? \xc2\xa0Does he think the housing -- and based on this number today, 27 percent down for July for existing home sales, is he -- does he think that the administration, that the Treasury Department is on top of the housing issue?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, something to keep in mind is a big part of this dropoff is as a result of the end of the first-time homebuyer tax credit. \xc2\xa0A lot of people rushed in to beat the deadline on that, and so the number is going to be -- the number is a tough number.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we\xe2\x80\x99re not dissatisfied with the rate at which we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to ameliorate the problem, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything that we can to help move this economy forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is it a success? \xc2\xa0Is Tim Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s housing program a success?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave that to the economists and the pundits to decide. \xc2\xa0All we can do is everything we can to grow this economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0And can I ask Mr. Brennan a question about al-Shabaab? \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken in the past about the Americans who have traveled to fight alongside al-Shabaab. \xc2\xa0What can you tell us about that? \xc2\xa0Are they still recruiting Americans? \xc2\xa0How much of a threat do you think al-Shabaab ultimately will pose to the United States?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Well, al-Shabaab has a very violent agenda inside of Somalia, and as was seen in Kampala with the tragic bombing there current with the World Cup, they have brought the agenda outside of Somalia.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 They also have recruited a number of individuals from outside of Somalia, including from the West, including from the United States. \xc2\xa0This is something that we are very concerned about. \xc2\xa0A number of these individuals have gone to Somalia, and many of them have lost their lives. \xc2\xa0So it is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to look at very closely. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re partnering with the countries in the area to ensure that al-Shabaab is not able to carry out attacks in the region.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are they still having success recruiting? \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re mainly from Minnesota, right, the Somali --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0There are a number of Somali communities in the United States where individuals have departed from. \xc2\xa0This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re, again, looking at very closely. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s their effort to try to bring people into that country, with, quite frankly, a mischaracterization and misrepresentation of what they find there. \xc2\xa0And I think a lot of individuals from outside of Somalia who have gone there have found that it is not what it is cracked up to be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, can I follow up?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Jackie, sure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the United States think that al-Shabaab is officially in league with al Qaeda? \xc2\xa0And do you see them attacking or having the capacity to attack outside Africa?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Al Qaeda in East Africa has operated in that part of the world for well over a decade, and many individuals who are currently within al-Shabaab also are part of al Qaeda in East Africa. \xc2\xa0So there is some crossover between those two organizations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that everybody in al-Shabaab is part of al Qaeda, but there are a number of individuals within that organization that are dedicated to carrying out attacks not just inside of Somalia, like the tragic one that I just mentioned earlier, but also outside of the area.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So we are, again, working with the countries and governments in the region to ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to share information with them, to bolster their capability to repel and repulse any types of al-Shabaab efforts to carry out attacks in their countries.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Bill.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s an election coming up in November and polls showing repeatedly that the economy is the number one issue by far for most people. \xc2\xa0Why is the President spending the week after his vacation almost entirely on foreign policy? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the calculation there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, I tell you what, the President is not going to be spending most of his week just on foreign policy. \xc2\xa0Every single day --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s got a speech on Iraq, he\xe2\x80\x99s got meetings on Middle East peace.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I assure you that there are things that the President does that you don\xe2\x80\x99t get invited to, unfortunately. \xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99s focused every single day on the economy. \xc2\xa0Today he received briefings on what was happening in the housing market, what was happening in the economy. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to do that. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll be meeting with his economic advisors when we get back next week. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99ll be continuing to urge Republicans in the Senate to stop obstructing the important small business bill so that they can cut -- so they can end capital gains taxes for their investments, so they can create jobs again.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 So I assure you that, alongside all the other things that are on the President\xe2\x80\x99s plate, he\xe2\x80\x99s continued to focus on the economy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he want to publicly reply, for example, to Leader Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s speech of today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think the President is satisfied that the Vice President is out talking about it a little bit today, and we\xe2\x80\x99re taking some questions here on it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Elizabeth.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, I had a question on the $30 billion lending facility for small businesses. \xc2\xa0I know this is top on the agenda when Congress comes back in session. \xc2\xa0But what could the administration have done to move that forward more quickly, given that it was announced in January, I believe?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I mean, the President has been working with Congress to move a number of initiatives forward, and importantly, the small business legislation. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been out on the stump talking about it. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s obviously dealt with the leadership to move it forward.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The President thinks that we need to do more. \xc2\xa0If you look at what the -- if you look at the speech that John Boehner gave today, one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important is that he talks about how we need to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans so that it will help small businesses. \xc2\xa0Well, all the while, Republicans in the Senate are blocking an effort that actually would help small businesses. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 What Boehner suggests independent economists have said would only impact 3 percent or less of small businesses at a cost of some $700 billion to the federal budget. \xc2\xa0What the President is proposing is eliminating capital gains on small businesses and freeing up lending so that we actually can create a situation where small businesses can create jobs.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The Wall Street Journal reported just recently that the issue for small businesses right now is that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to hire because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to the capital that they need in order to do it. \xc2\xa0What the President thinks we need to do is get them the capital they need to do it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a big choice in this election, and that choices comes down to, are we going to move forward or are we going to move back to the policies that got us into this economic crisis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Kate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A follow-up on -- sorry, on stem cells. \xc2\xa0What would the administration like to see Congress do on that matter?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Like I said, we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing it. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific action that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing it to see what\xe2\x80\x99s most appropriate so that we can keep this important, potentially lifesaving research moving forward in the most ethical way possible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What will the President\xe2\x80\x99s message be in New Orleans on Sunday? \xc2\xa0And is he satisfied with the pace of progress there five years after Katrina?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve obviously done a lot to get help down to the Gulf even before this oil spill had had such a terrible impact on the region. \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99ll talk a little bit about our efforts, what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done on Katrina, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing on the Gulf to a certain extent, and what we can do to help the Gulf region recover.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Hopefully, later in the week we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more specifics for you on what\xe2\x80\x99s on his schedule and what will specifically be in the speech.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does he think there should be more money given to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about this more later.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Okay, and then also just following up, can you talk a bit about Jimmy Carter\xe2\x80\x99s tip to North Korea to bring back the American detained there?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment on anything that could have a negative impact on any private humanitarian mission that might be happening. \xc2\xa0We obviously think that Mr. Gomes should be released. \xc2\xa0There will probably be more information on this sometime in the future.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The administration has made much of the readiness of the Iraqi troops to handle their own security, and we heard Mr. Brennan talk about that this morning as well. \xc2\xa0What is the confidence level that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to handle their own security long after the last American troops pull out in 2011?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0I think if you look at the developments this past year, the Iraqis have demonstrated their capability to very successfully carry out operations against al Qaeda in Iraq. \xc2\xa0In April I believe it was, Abu Ayub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the two head al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, were killed by an operation that was led by Iraqi security forces.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 The training has been ongoing. \xc2\xa0Iraqi security forces have demonstrated their ability to carry out these operations very effectively, efficiently. \xc2\xa0They are dedicated to protecting the lives of Iraqi civilians. \xc2\xa0So we are very pleased with the progress that the Iraqi security forces have made.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 We still have close to 50,000 U.S. troops inside of Iraq. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to advise and assist them. \xc2\xa0But our confidence is strong even though there are some elements within Iraq that are dedicated to trying to disrupt the security in that country. \xc2\xa0Iraqi security forces -- the troops, the leaders are particularly determined to ensure that peace and security are able to prevail inside Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Even when they\xe2\x80\x99ve taken those leading roles on these various operations, the U.S. military has always been there to support, so when all of the U.S. troops pull out in 2011, I mean, is the confidence level there that they\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to continue doing this and not go into reverse?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why there was a protracted period for the drawdown of U.S. forces, so that we could do this in a responsible and thoughtful way. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s not a cliff. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not as though we\xe2\x80\x99re all there one day, and then we move out the next day. \xc2\xa0We have seen the progress that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to make adjustments as far as the training and support mission. \xc2\xa0And looking out over the next 17 months or so, we are confident the Iraqis are going to be able to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Major.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. Brennan, a couple more on Iraq, if you\xe2\x80\x99d be so kind. \xc2\xa0And also to you, Bill, if you want to weigh in. \xc2\xa0The Vice President said yesterday two things about Iraq that caught some analysts somewhat surprised. \xc2\xa0One, he was absolutely confident that the Iraqis would, excuse me, reach a settlement in their political impasse and put together a unified government, and that Iranian influence was exaggerated in Iraq and largely minimal. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Now, there have been no shortage of briefings at the Pentagon and from other places saying that Iranian influence has not been minimal in Iran, it\xe2\x80\x99s been destabilizing and in some cases lethal, not to mention destructive. \xc2\xa0And many analysts I talked to yesterday are not confident the Iraqis are going to any time in the near future pull together this unity government. \xc2\xa0Does the President share those very optimistic appraisals of what\xe2\x80\x99s not only going on in Iraq right now but what may likely happen in the future?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President is not surprised at all that politics have broken out in Iraq and so that the prolonged bartering and negotiations over the formation of a government are consistent with what happens in many democratic countries throughout the world.We are determined to continue to work with the Iraqis so that they can forge an enduring government, making sure that all the different sectarian groups feel as though they are represented within that government. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to move forward on that.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 As far as Iranian influence in Iraq, as the Vice President said, it is minimal but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not worrisome. \xc2\xa0And we are continuing to watch very carefully Iranian efforts to try to destabilize Iraq and to sow dissention within that country. \xc2\xa0This is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to watch very carefully. \xc2\xa0I think Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior on a number of fronts has caused serious concern, certainly in Washington, as well as throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 And what we want to do is to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to work very closely with the Iraqi government, with the Iraqi security forces, to keep that Iranian influence -- destabilizing influence in that country to a minimum.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And if I could ask about Afghanistan, the Vice President also said, \xe2\x80\x9cOnly now do the U.S. and NATO forces have the full complement of resources they need. \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t buy into the \xe2\x80\x98we have failed\xe2\x80\x99 rhetoric.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And if the December evaluation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is still on schedule, as every indication is that it is, is four months really enough time to fully evaluate if only now all the resources are on the ground and the full component of that strategy is going forward?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Well, the evaluation for December certainly is still on schedule, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been regular evaluations of our progress in Afghanistan, and they are taking place. \xc2\xa0We are looking at areas where we can continue to move against the Taliban and against the insurgents in that country, continue to work very closely and carefully with the Afghan security forces. \xc2\xa0They are continuing to make progress throughout the country.So we\xe2\x80\x99re still on the path that the President laid out. \xc2\xa0I think the President feels, as the Vice President said, we now have the complement of U.S. forces in Afghanistan that\xe2\x80\x99s going to give us the opportunity to enable the Afghan security and military forces to successfully prosecute this effort and to bring greater stability and security to more parts of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Should the American public expect the trajectory of the war effort in Afghanistan to look greatly different than it does right now in just four months\xe2\x80\x99 time?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0The next several months are going to be I think consistent with what we have seen over the past couple of months, which is that the tempo of operations has increased as a result of the increased ISAF presence in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Unfortunately, some of the casualties have increased, but also the Taliban has taken a significant number of casualties. \xc2\xa0So this is something that we are continuing to work very closely with our Afghan partners on. \xc2\xa0And our resolve is strong, as is the resolve of the Karzai government. \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Carol.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have one on Iraq. \xc2\xa0Come September 1st, how does the administration view the conflict there? \xc2\xa0Does the United States still consider itself at war in Iraq?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0The fact that we now no longer have combat troops there, we have less than 50,000 troops that are providing the training and assist mission inside Iraq to Iraqi forces, I think underscores that the ongoing effort to ensure that groups like al Qaeda in Iraq are not able to destabilize the country need to continue apace. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why we still have a significant number of U.S. military forces there, a significant number of U.S. civilians who are assisting the Iraqi government. \xc2\xa0We recognize that there\xe2\x80\x99s still more progress that needs to be made inside of Iraq to ensure that security is going to prevail throughout the country and is going to be enduring for many, many years to come.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So do you still consider the United States as fighting two wars?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0Right now we still have two theaters of military operations -- Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that will -- as of September 1st, you\xe2\x80\x99ll still view this as --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0We have nearly 50,000 U.S. combat -- U.S. troops inside of Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And then can I ask -- Congressman Rangel last night took issue with the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments that he end his career with dignity, saying that the President has not \xe2\x80\x9cbeen around long enough to determine what my dignity is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 I wonder what your reaction to that is. \xc2\xa0Is that -- is this sort of sniping helpful to a party that\xe2\x80\x99s facing already tough elections in November?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the comments. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a particular reaction.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what he said.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, thank you. \xc2\xa0Can we expect the President to speak out any more on Islamic community center near Ground Zero? \xc2\xa0And also, will the White House play any role in discussions about moving the facility to a different location?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0No and no.</p>\n<p>Okay?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you guys paying attention to the primaries going on today?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re watching what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, but any day that Americans are voting is a fun day for the people who are -- who enjoy following politics in this operation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How is the President enjoying the vacation? \xc2\xa0And what about the weather?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re having a great time, actually. \xc2\xa0The rain has not dampened spirits. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re playing board games. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard reports of Taboo and Scrabble being played. \xc2\xa0And this will probably get me fired, but I know that Valerie did not do so well in Scrabble against the President. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re also watching some movies, reading some books, and getting some good down time, spending time with each other.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What movies and what books, please?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0You all saw the books that they got at the bookstore, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything further than that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure on the movies.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When will we see you again to brief?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be on a TBD basis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has he made a dent in that Franzen book?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Not that I know of. \xc2\xa0He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t as of when I asked him about it yesterday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He had what?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0He had not as of when I asked him about it yesterday.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How\xe2\x80\x99s his golf game, what does he shoot?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not much of a golfer, so I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been out there with him.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you ask him what he has read?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0No, I actually just asked him about the Franzen book.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, one more on Iraq?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Okay.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Mr. Brennan, is President Obama glad that those Democrats two and three years ago that were advocating an immediate end to U.S. involvement in Iraq did not prevail in their efforts?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, can you say that one more time?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, is President Obama glad that the Democrats two and three years ago that were advocating an immediate end to the U.S. role in Iraq did not prevail in their efforts?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0The President laid out in very specific terms what he thought our appropriate objectives were in Iraq in a speech that he gave at Camp Lejeune in February of 2009, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s pleased with is that the brave men and women of our military have achieved that objective.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0John, could I ask you more question, a policy question on AQI? \xc2\xa0Based on your analysis and what U.S. intelligence is learning, are most if not all acts of violence now linkable or linked to al Qaeda in Iraq? \xc2\xa0Or are there still pockets of sectarian division, as there were three our four years ago? \xc2\xa0It was a great debate we were having three or four years ago, who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for most of the violence, what\xe2\x80\x99s the source. \xc2\xa0Do we have a better grasp now on what the source of the greatly diminished violence is now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0It is my view that most of the acts of violence that are carried out, particularly in Baghdad and some of the major cities, are carried out by either al Qaeda in Iraq members or remnants of that organization that have splintered from it. \xc2\xa0Yes, I would see al Qaeda in Iraq as being the main perpetrator of these types of attacks.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And there will still be a role to target those for these remaining 50,000 troops?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0The Iraqi security forces will have the lead on these operations. \xc2\xa0We will assist and support the Iraqis in their efforts to counter the terrorist threat inside that country, which is a threat to their civilians, as well as to our military and civilians as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just to clarify, Mr. Brennan, you came in and you said that there are now fewer than 50,000 troops. \xc2\xa0Will that number need to diminish, and at what rate?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly the rate, but it will continue to diminish through the next year. \xc2\xa0There is a plan that the U.S. forces in Iraq have, but it will be adjusted and calibrated based on conditions on the ground.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Static for a while -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have a static at 50,000 or 48,000 for awhile then start to draw down rapidly? \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be bringing this down on a rather consistent basis --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0I refer you to the U.S. military and the Pentagon on the exact plans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have the exact number, just less than 50,000, or any specific number?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BRENNAN: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the exact number. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s slightly under 50,000. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the announcement was made by Iraqi -- U.S. forces in Iraq.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, as you hit this milestone, do you envision any scenario where the U.S. troop presence could go back up? \xc2\xa0I mean, if civil war breaks out, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a spasm of violence there? \xc2\xa0Or is it pretty much the Iraqis are on their own now to handle war and peace in their own country?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Well, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re wandering into hypothetical territory where -- the President laid out specifically what our timeline was there. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved a very important point. \xc2\xa0Next week, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- we change our mission from a combat one to one where we advise and assist the Iraqi forces. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to engage in what that hypothetical suggests.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, just one last question. \xc2\xa0Shirley Sherrod has met with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today and she declined the job offer. \xc2\xa0And I was wondering, just given the immense coverage and time that was devoted to this issue a few weeks ago, if you had any reaction?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thought I\xe2\x80\x99d give you the opportunity to.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. BURTON: \xc2\xa0Appreciate you. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 Q \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Bill, is one of the options for the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech an address to the nation next Wednesday?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR.
