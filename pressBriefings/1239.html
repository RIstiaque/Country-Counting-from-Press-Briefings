EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 On the health care ruling, the passage here in which the judge says that the unchecked expansion of congressional power to the limit suggested by the minimum coverage provision would invite unbridled exercise of federal\xc2\xa0 powers.\xc2\xa0 And this is not about -- just about health care, but it\xe2\x80\x99s about individual right to choose to participate.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this vindicate or validate a central argument of skeptics, which is that despite your intentions you can\'t require people to participate in a law like this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a couple of important things for perspective, Ben.\xc2\xa0 First and foremost, obviously the administration argued on the other side of this case and disagrees with the ruling.\xc2\xa0 I do think it is important to keep some perspective about the fact that there are now 20 or so cases making their way through federal courts.\xc2\xa0 This was the Eastern District of Virginia; 115 miles away, the Western District Court of Virginia ruled November 30th to uphold the same provision that the Eastern District and its judge had ruled against.\xc2\xa0 So I think the other court -- the Eastern District of Michigan on October 7th ruled in favor of the law as it was passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, we disagree with the ruling.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the individual responsibility portions of the Affordable Care Act are the basis and the foundation for examining and doing away with insurance company discrimination on behalf of preexisting conditions.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, without an individual responsibility portion in the law, you could not find yourself dealing with preexisting conditions because the only people that would likely get involved in purchasing health care would be the very sick.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, that would be enormously expensive.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given that it is so fundamental to the whole law and you have these different court rulings, is it clear to you that this is going to go to the Supreme Court?\xc2\xa0 And if so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am not a legal scholar, Ben.\xc2\xa0 I think it is safe to say that because there are several other cases in the pipeline and because of -- again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got disparate court rulings 115 miles away -- that the bill will continue to have its day in court.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I do think it is important that even this judge ruled that the bill continues to move forward in terms of its implementation.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, the individual responsibility aspects of this legislation weren\xe2\x80\x99t to go into effect until 2014 so there\xe2\x80\x99s some time to work this through.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to wrap up this part, what gives the White House confidence that ultimately it will prevail if this case continues to go to the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not, Ben, a lawyer in terms of the legal arguments that underpinned each of the briefs.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that challenges like this are nothing new in terms of laws that have come before the courts in the past in which our position has prevailed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that it is constitutional.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, of the three courts that have rendered decisions on this question, two have ruled in our favor.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quick question on the tax deal.\xc2\xa0 Democrats in the House are talking of targeting the estate tax provision that they\'re unhappy with and maybe dealing with that in an amendment or legislatively trying to change that language.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House urging those Democrats not to do that out of fear it could cause the whole deal to unravel?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say this, Ben, obviously, the Senate is going to vote on -- have a procedural vote a little bit later on this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I think the President is encouraged by what we hear in the Senate and believe that the legislation will pass that hurdle and be one important step closer to passage.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get involved in sort of what the amendment process might be in the House at this point.\xc2\xa0 I think you have seen, whether it was in here on Friday with former President Clinton, or whether you have seen just this morning that this is something that has broad bipartisan support in the public, it\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a good agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent agreement on behalf of millions of Americans who won\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up.\xc2\xa0 Those that are impacted in having lost a job in this recession will have the security of knowing that their unemployment benefits won\xe2\x80\x99t fall victim to politics.\xc2\xa0 And the middle class will enjoy a significant tax cut in the payroll tax portions of this bill.\xc2\xa0 So we are encouraged that we get closer and closer each day to having this agreement become law.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the initial reaction to the health care ruling?\xc2\xa0 Were you surprised by it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how concerned are you about the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of other lawsuits out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this is the third federal court that\xe2\x80\x99s rendered a decision on this portion of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And two of those courts have upheld it.\xc2\xa0 So I think we are confident that the Affordable Care Act will be upheld.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s the next step for you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Justice, obviously, is going to have to make some decisions about appealing this particular case.\xc2\xa0 My sense is that that appeal decision is something they\xe2\x80\x99ll likely make, but I would point you over to them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a question -- Larry Summers gave a farewell speech today at a think tank, and I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering how the decision-making is going on his replacement.\xc2\xa0 Do you still hope to do that before the end of the year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I will say that it is -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that that\xe2\x80\x99s going to get done by the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, a whole host of legislative -- lots of legislative work around the lame duck with a budget, taxes, START, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d the DREAM Act -- there are a whole host of things that have taken up a bunch of bandwidth and a bunch of time.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me whether that will get done before the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It appears that one of the main reasons why the judge ruled this way -- ruled that Congress exceeded its constitutional power -- is because, for what I can only imagine were political reasons, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctax,\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of the penalty for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance who can afford it, was replaced by the word \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And he said, because the legislators who drafted --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have been getting ready for this.\xc2\xa0 I have not had a chance to read that.\xc2\xa0 And I know our folks in here are taking a look at it as well as at the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a direct response to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s -- some of the individual reasoning in the judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision just because I have not had an opportunity to look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is how it is.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just reading his own --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I\'m not doubting what you\'re reading.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying we have not -- I have not had a chance to read it and I\'ve not had a chance to talk to counsel here about how they take it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, well, the question would be was it, in retrospect, a mistake to change the terminology from -- I understand you\'re not ready to answer it right now.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could get back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I need some time to have somebody take a look at it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but can you get back to me on that point, though?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll see whether they can, yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You keep talking about the two other cases where a judge ruled otherwise.\xc2\xa0 In those, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that those were Democratic-appointed judges, and in this case this judge was appointed by a Republican.\xc2\xa0 Is politics, you think, playing into any of this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I, Dan, don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 The judges clearly make different decisions based on different points of reasoning.\xc2\xa0 I think -- our belief is that the health care act is -- will go forward and that it is constitutional; that it improves people\xe2\x80\x99s lives, and particularly this is the basis, as I\'ve said, of the provision that allows us to finally address the lingering discrimination against those who have a preexisting condition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It also, by the way -- your health care, my health care, everybody who has health care in this room pays the uncompensated -- the cost for the uncompensated care when somebody doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have health insurance, gets into a car accident, becomes sick and ends up going to the doctor through the emergency room or because of the seriousness of their illness and not having regular checkups or primary care.\xc2\xa0 All of that is -- that\'s paid for by you and me.\xc2\xa0 We seek to address that in the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why I think the progress that we\'ve made in offering tax credits for those to afford to be able to have a minimum set of health care -- a minimum standard of health care that allows us not to pay for their health care in that sense, and to get the health care that they need.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction was when he was briefed?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not seen the President since the ruling came down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it any annoyance at all that this signature item for the President and for this White House continues to be challenged -- something that the President says is critical for all Americans, yet it continues to be challenged in a court?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t -- I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the motives of -- I would appeal only this basis -- I don\'t remember quite the coverage when both courts upheld the law, but that\'s just from the cheap seats of being --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a plane that landed safely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- an armchair executive producer.\xc2\xa0 Well, you do mention that -- sometimes when planes land safely there\xe2\x80\x99s not breaking news.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I get another crack at a question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can try.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Do you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re sort of like the district court.\xc2\xa0 One court ruled -- go ahead.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Congress that\'s about -- the House that\'s about to take office in January is much more predisposed to oppose the health care law.\xc2\xa0 Do you worry at all this ruling politically will help provide momentum for either starvation of the health care law through lack of funding or stronger action against the health care law?\xc2\xa0 Do you think this politically will be ammunition?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t because I think the position that\'s held by those that seek to repeal the law I think has been their position both when courts ruled against their position and when courts rule in a way that upholds their larger position.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t think that impacts it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think is important to understand, though, when you roll these provisions back, or when you repeal these provisions, the impact of that is, as I said -- if you are somebody that cannot get health care because of a preexisting condition, the guarantee that when this is fully implemented in 2014 that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do that, that\'s wiped away in a ruling like this.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s important for everyone to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Given the signals that Henry Hudson had sent in previous writings on this, back in October for example, would you have been surprised if he had done anything other than what he did in this --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 As I said earlier, I don\'t think this was -- I don\'t think the decision today and how he decided it was a surprise to anybody here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you said you\'re not a legal scholar, and I\'ll accept that, although -- the President is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to law school like you did, Chip.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s worked out so well, you\'re here in the front row of the briefing room.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not even the only one --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Savannah as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\'re both trying to forget it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I hear the theme music to L.A. Law playing in the background.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s exactly what it was like, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But the President was a legal scholar and still -- and you said you haven\'t talked to him since this came down --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but has he been keeping up on this, talking to the Attorney General?\xc2\xa0 Does he get personally involved in making the arguments and discussing it with Justice?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 Not that I\'m aware of with Justice.\xc2\xa0 Obviously in our regular meetings with him, White House Counsel Bob Bauer will update him on where different courts are, a few -- not long ago in terms of the Western District of Virginia, that was something we covered.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t honestly remember, and I can go back and ask and see if whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s read rulings before.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not just whether he\xe2\x80\x99s read and whether he gets briefed on them, but does he put in his two cents and make suggestions about how to argue these things?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me take that question.\xc2\xa0 Not that comes to my memory, but let me go flesh that out with others who may.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think this has been asked -- START, where do we stand on START?\xc2\xa0 And is it still the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to stay here until it\xe2\x80\x99s done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, to the second question.\xc2\xa0 I think -- quite frankly, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably one of the next couple of pieces of business that the Senate will move to, not long after the procedural vote and then -- obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear yet the number of hours of debate after the procedural vote today before the Senate takes up for final passage of the tax agreement.\xc2\xa0 But I think fairly soon after, the Senate will move to the debate on START ratification.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our belief is, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a number of Republican senators come out, that this is a treaty that has the votes to pass the Senate and I believe will pass the Senate before Congress goes home for the holidays.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he stay here until Christmas Eve or beyond if necessary?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If that\'s what it takes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he -- right up till New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve if that\'s what it takes?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President is hopeful to spend a little time with family and friends in Hawaii, but if Congress is here the President will be here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sounds like any chance of getting out this weekend is\xc2\xa0 --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few extra days to pull together those Christmas presents that you put off buying.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent amount still left that getting out of here Friday or Saturday is probably not the day I\'d pick in the pool.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And would he also stay until "don\'t ask, don\'t tell" is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll say this.\xc2\xa0 I think the President will be in Washington and in the White House for as long as Congress is in session.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any comments on the Boehner interview last night?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I only saw some clips of it, so I don\'t have anything on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Don\'t want to go there -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to talk about -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration view the mandate to purchase health insurance as a tax?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, Mike, I\'m not a lawyer.\xc2\xa0 I think we look at it as the basis by which we can address important issues like the discrimination against those who have a preexisting condition.\xc2\xa0 We look at it as how you deal with uncompensated care as a result of people going to the emergency room and everyone\xe2\x80\x99s health insurance going up as a result of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because one of the legal arguments against this ruling seems to be that it goes against Congress\xe2\x80\x99s ability to issue a tax.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'ve not, as I said to Jake, I have not had an opportunity to speak on the merits of some of what the judge ruled.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CEOs are coming to meet with the President on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit about what he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping to accomplish in that meeting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President has over the course of the last several years, last two years, at fairly regular intervals had CEOs in for meetings, discussions, for lunches.\xc2\xa0 Over the past few weeks the President has met with what I think you would consider economists on the left, economists on the right.\xc2\xa0 He has and will have an occasion to have similar meetings with labor and discuss a whole range of ideas that are out there in terms of continuing our fragile economic recovery.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think if you look at something like the South Korea free trade agreement, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue -- there are clearly issues that Congress is going to deal with and the administration is going to deal with where we share the opinions of those in business as to how to expand our economy, how to create jobs, and how to keep things going.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Donohue from the Chamber of Commerce, in an interview with FOX on Friday, suggested that the relationship with the business community -- he\xe2\x80\x99s seeing signs of improvement. Do you have reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously there have been some tense times between the administration and the Chamber of Commerce.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think whether it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I mean, obviously one of the biggest proponents of the Korea free trade agreement was the Chamber of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 I think that whether it\xe2\x80\x99s individuals at the Chamber, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s members of the Chamber, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s CEOs that aren\'t members of the Chamber or belong to other organizations, again, I think there are a series of issues that are important to the business community, that are important to getting our economy moving again, and I think those are issues that the President is eager to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up -- you know the administration is taking a legal position in its papers that the authority for the individual mandate lies in the power to tax.\xc2\xa0 Is that inconsistent with your political arguments that health care reform will not raise taxes on the middle class?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How so?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it is -- again, it\xe2\x80\x99s the basis for -- I guess would you presume that you pay a tax right now on your health care for -- would you consider the thousand dollars that you pay as part of your health care a tax because somebody who does not have health care is paid for by you?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I\'m not paying it to the government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, you\'re paying it to an insurance company.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration states that the individual mandate and the fees raised, the penalty, constitutes a tax -- leaving aside how much revenue --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You went to law school, not me.\xc2\xa0 I -- we think, and based on the rulings of two other courts and the belief of this administration that the law will be upheld.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just said a couple of minutes ago when Dan asked, you said you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if politics motivated Judge Hudson\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xc2\xa0 You also said to Chip you weren\'t surprised by the result.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, some Democrats are saying this is a case of judicial activism --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think what -- Chip mentioned that there had been earlier writings that I think led most people to believe and understand that this would be the ruling that he would make. So, again, I don\'t --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not signing onto Democrats who are saying this is a case of judicial activism by a Bush appointee?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'m not rendering a decision on that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just saying that I think some of what we\'ve heard about this case -- look, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s -- 115 miles away a different judge in a different district rendered a different decision.\xc2\xa0 So I think there are obviously a number of different viewpoints on this.\xc2\xa0 Our belief is that when all of the legal wrangling is said and done, that this is something that will be upheld.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the tax deal, there was a poll this morning from the Pew Center that found that there was support for the tax compromise fairly evenly distributed with Democrats just as likely as Republicans to support that.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think I tried to make that point last week.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think that that\'s a sign, and does the White House believe that the rancor that we\'ve heard from liberal Democrats in Washington is not reflective of how the country as a whole, how Democrats in the country feel about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think -- look, I think whether you -- we sent out the statements from a number of people across the country that represent Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- mayors, governors, governors-elect.\xc2\xa0 You heard from in this room former President Bill Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I think the notion that the view of some in Congress is monolithic to the viewpoint of every person in the party -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that then.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not surprised by the polling that shows that a vast majority of people don\'t want to see their taxes go up at the end of the year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So do you think that the protest, very loud protest -- in fact, so loud that they\xe2\x80\x99ve put passage in the House in some doubt -- are -- what\xe2\x80\x99s behind that if it\xe2\x80\x99s not reflective of how people really feel?\xc2\xa0 Is it just politics?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that\'s a question for them.\xc2\xa0 Look, I understand --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- your analysis is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I understand that people are frustrated that, as a result of a whole series of things, we find ourselves having to make an agreement that contains things that the President finds less than satisfactory.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of how this place works.\xc2\xa0 But again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think last week that it was the monolithic viewpoint of every person in the party or every person even in the progressive wing of the party.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the administration inclined to seek an expedited Supreme Court ruling on this health care matter?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mark, again, I think I\'d leave that to the Department of Justice, who will make some legal decisions on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On tax cuts, why is the President doing this mini media blitz, this afternoon with four TV stations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think this is -- I think the President is just looking for more ways and more opportunities to talk to the American people about what he thinks is important and what\xe2\x80\x99s good in this agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I said this a lot last week and I should start this week by saying it again, and that is if you look at the individual components of this agreement, they make sense economically.\xc2\xa0 We are -- by preserving the rate for middle-class taxpayers, we\'re providing them certainty in not having their taxes go up at the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 We\'re taking the politics out of unemployment insurance for the 2 million people that would stand to lose those benefits this year and the millions more next year that could see those benefits threatened.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut is important for middle-class families. It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a tax that -- you pay taxes on Social Security up to $106,800 of your income.\xc2\xa0 By reducing the amount that an employee is required to pay into that, that\'s money that\'s going to come into -- that money will be in the pockets of those middle-class families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This makes sense for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It contains things that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, but it contains much more of what we think is necessary and what we like than there is to dislike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did you choose the cities that get the interviews?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Finkenbinder with a dart and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, really.\xc2\xa0 I know you\'re not a lawyer.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But I\'m a good dart-thrower.\xc2\xa0 Look, truthfully, we picked a few markets around the country that represent some geographic diversity -- the South, the Midwest, the West.\xc2\xa0 We had animated discussions with scheduling.\xc2\xa0 I would like to do 14, not four.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity to talk to the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who said he wanted -- he said he wanted to do 14 not four?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, this is a sort of argument that we were having with scheduling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, to follow up on that, were they in districts where there are members who are undecided?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any discussions about that so I don\'t -- they were not picked because of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d like to shift to the Afghan review.\xc2\xa0 That\'s coming up I believe this week.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the outline, what\xe2\x80\x99s the plan?\xc2\xa0 Is there like a final NSC meeting that the President attends -- and will we hear from him?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s regular monthly AfPak review meeting will be Tuesday, tomorrow morning at 11 a.m., as it\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled now, in the Situation Room.\xc2\xa0 That will have the people that you are used to seeing at that meeting.\xc2\xa0 The President will make a statement on Thursday and we will have -- there will be a public release for the December review.\xc2\xa0 That will happen on Thursday --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of the document?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Of the document.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope that after that we\'ll have in here, schedule permitting, Secretary Gates and Secretary Clinton and others to take some questions on the review.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And should we expect any broad changes in policy or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to get ahead of all the meetings.\xc2\xa0 I think we are -- as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the President say on his most recent trip to Afghanistan, I think we are seeing some progress. We still have -- and I think you know many of them -- we have many challenges in both security and governance.\xc2\xa0 We have -- well, we have progress and we have challenges.\xc2\xa0 That is something that is talked much about when we go into these meetings in the Situation Room.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously there will be another meeting before the review is released, so I don\'t want to get ahead of where we are on that.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President feels confident that we\'re on track on where we should be and that we can certainly meet our commitments to begin a conditions-based drawdown of our forces next July.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, he\'ll get the review tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 He\'ll see the review tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been -- there are different aspects of and drafts of this, some of which he has seen.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow obviously is the normal meeting that generally takes about an hour and a half to two hours.\xc2\xa0 Obviously some part of that will be based on the review and some part of that will go through in his briefing some of what has been talked about both in the review and in the weekly memos that he gets from commanders and ambassadors.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I\'m sorry, will there be a meeting that\'s just focused on the review, or is that tomorrow?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There have been a number of those.\xc2\xa0 It will be covered in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s meeting, too.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any reaction to the comments from President Karzai in The Washington Post today, which -- he\xe2\x80\x99s quoted, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to choose sides today, I\'d choose the Taliban\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to anybody about that, no.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as the House Democrats talk about what they want to change in the tax deal, are Geithner, Lew and Vice President Biden an active part of those discussions as they were in the initial conference with Republicans and Democrats?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- look, I think a number of people are having discussions with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President is having discussions with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So I think that subset of people is likely involved as well as others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not as though it\xe2\x80\x99s round two of negotiations with regular meetings on the Hill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, about the health care fight, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a full plate of things that you want to accomplish in the next two years, how much of a distraction is it to have to keep litigating your major fight from the last two years at the same time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, people challenging the constitutionality of different laws is nothing new and nothing that\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick one on the health care ruling.\xc2\xa0 You said that you remain confident that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to -- that the law will be upheld.\xc2\xa0 But the judge that just ruled against the administration was appointed by a Republican; the two who ruled for the administration were appointed by Democrats.\xc2\xa0 How can you stay confident when this could end up in front of the Roberts Supreme Court?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think we have a good argument.\xc2\xa0 I think the merits of the case are strong and I think its constitutionality will be upheld.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two aspects on the tax -- for the House Democrats who have said they cannot vote for the language as it\xe2\x80\x99s currently in the Senate, has anybody in recent days brought the President language, particularly on the estate tax, some kind of changes in language that might be proposed on the House side that could still work on the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President has talked with members and heard their concerns, but I do not know of -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of anything that would fit the requirement that you just said about language for both.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there some changes being kicked around or at least run by the White House?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the biggest changes that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the agreement are the addition of the energy credits for production and that\xe2\x80\x99s the basis by which the legislation is written that will be voted on by the Senate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the Senate vote this afternoon, what will you take from that -- a measure of what?\xc2\xa0 Of strength, or of where people are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think -- look, I think this will give you a sense of where people are in the overall agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think if you look at -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s broad bipartisan support in the Senate for this.\xc2\xa0 I think there is clearly broad bipartisan support throughout the country, and I think and believe that that will be reflected in the vote that the Senate makes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Peter.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 As you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s achievable in the rest of the lame duck session, where does the DREAM Act and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d sort of come into play?\xc2\xa0 How is the President going to prioritize those?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a list of one, two, three, four; there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of things that I think the President believes are important and can be done this year.\xc2\xa0 I think the Senate is likely to move not long after taxes to the START -- ratification of the START treaty.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d and DREAM, along with government funding, are all in a basket of issues that are likely to come after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very much alive?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything else that you want --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a follow-up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me come around.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just -- there\xe2\x80\x99s judicial nominations.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s Senate confirmations.\xc2\xa0 This is not an exhaustive list.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a considerable likelihood here on this tax vote that Speaker Pelosi is going to vote no.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really going to be the first example that I can think of on a major legislative initiative where the President and her have been at variance.\xc2\xa0 How does he feel about that and what does it say about the respective directions they\xe2\x80\x99re moving in?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I, Glenn, have not spoken to the President about that.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard a ton about vote counts in the House.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously the first procedural hurdle will be encountered this afternoon in the Senate and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where a decent amount of our energy has been directed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said, the President has reached out and talked to individual members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think each is going to have to evaluate what they feel is -- or how they feel about the agreement and whether they think it\xe2\x80\x99s important for the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he actively trying to convince her, or vice versa, to deal with this differently?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are there ongoing conversations between the two of them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the last time they spoke.\xc2\xa0 I can check on that, but --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What were his thoughts to the Bernie Sanders lengthy filibuster on Friday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have not talked to him about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, one other quick thing.\xc2\xa0 There was a sense that there were going to be some personnel announcements and some various moves prior to Christmas, prior to the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re now telling us that NEC is not likely going to be announced until the beginning of the year.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to see any really significant --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that because of the volume of the work that\xe2\x80\x99s been done in the lame duck, that most of this is going to get pushed over.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam, let me address just tangentially that what you said about Sanders.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think the President will be the first to agree that there are aspects of this that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before and as he said before.\xc2\xa0 Our preferred method was to make permanent the tax cuts for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 The votes weren\xe2\x80\x99t there in the Senate to do that.\xc2\xa0 And rather than threaten our economic recovery, the President believed that this bipartisan agreement was the best way to go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And he respects and he understands the frustration of those that have a different viewpoint on the agreement.\xc2\xa0 I think, at the same time, he believes that it is important for our economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for middle-class families and important to get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, just to be clear on \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d will the President direct the Senate to stay in session longer for this week if work on repealing that law isn\xe2\x80\x99t finished by the end of this week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the Senate is going to be in longer than this week.\xc2\xa0 And I think there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that based on the votes last week, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that a majority of the Senate supports the President\xe2\x80\x99s position of doing away with \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d repealing that.\xc2\xa0 And our -- certainly our hope is that the Senate will take this up again and it will see this done by the time the year ends.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 New litigation was filed in courts today challenging the constitutionality of \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What does the President have to say to opponents of that law who feel like they need to pursue litigation to get that off the books?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President would say the same thing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve said and the same thing that Secretary Gates has said, that one of the two entities, either Congress or the courts, is going to repeal or do away with \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The best way to do it would be to do it through Congress. And the House has passed that legislation.\xc2\xa0 And it is clear that a -- well more than a majority of -- well above a majority of U.S. senators believes that\xe2\x80\x99s the case as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- I think we\xe2\x80\x99re closer than we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been to making repeal a reality.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A slightly different take on the question -- the President has pledged to stay in town himself until START is done.\xc2\xa0 Would he pledge to stay in town until \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d is done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me be clear, the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- if START gets done, the President and Congress is here, the President is not leaving.\xc2\xa0 I said earlier that the President will be here as long as the Congress is here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I thought he pledged specifically, though, to stay in town until START was done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that we always envisioned it that if the Congress was here, the President would be here.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of important things beyond the tax agreement and START -- \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d being one of them -- that the President believes can be dealt with before Congress leaves town.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the legislative effort fails, are there other options on the table?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this is a distinct possibility now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I should say this.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a distinct possibility that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d will be repealed by the end of this year and that\xe2\x80\x99s where our effort is focused.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the American Legion --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President understands the viewpoint of the Legion, but also is getting advice from military commanders and those at the Department of Defense right now that the legislation is important and believes it should be passed.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the White House reaction to what both FOX and CBS reported as a Ralph Nader statement, including -- and this is a quote -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not my quote --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I doubt the President heard that.\xc2\xa0 I obviously have given a number of answers that would denote that we think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good agreement.\xc2\xa0 And I would say this to Democrats or Republicans.\xc2\xa0 I think whenever you compare anything to what the Nazis did, if you ever get to that point in your speech, stop, because nothing does.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, God willing, nothing ever will.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair enough.\xc2\xa0 Second, over the weekend, Sarah Palin was visiting Haiti.\xc2\xa0 She told reporters that she thought that anyone who was considering freezing aid to Haiti should go down there and visit first.\xc2\xa0 I think she was referring to a statement by Senator Leahy.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position on that, on freezing aid?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me look at what the statement is and whether or not there is some reasoning.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, our response to the earthquake in Haiti was and has been befitting a disaster of that magnitude and our response has been at the forefront of all the international responses on this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not aware of Senator Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s comment?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
