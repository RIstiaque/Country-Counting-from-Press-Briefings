EDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Welcome, everyone, aboard Air Force One en route to Camden, New Jersey, where we will continue to highlight the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to lift up what is working when it comes to building stronger communities.\xc2\xa0 As part of that effort, we are releasing the Task Force on 21st Century Policing final report, which provides a blueprint for cities to develop innovative policing strategies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\'re also releasing new tools to help communities implement the task force recommendations, including the White House police data initiative, community policing grants, and a body-worn camera toolkit designed to help law enforcement and professionals and the communities they serve plan and implement body-camera-worn programs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the administration, as you all I think have seen now, is releasing the final Equipment Working Group report, which will enhance accountability and increase transparency in federal programs that support the transfer of equipment to state and local law enforcement agencies.\xc2\xa0 The President will use today as an opportunity to discuss how these efforts, along with others, help build trust among law enforcement and the communities they serve.</p>\n<p>And with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the equipment ban, can you give us a sense of the scope of this?\xc2\xa0 How many pieces of those banned equipment had been distributed before?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Nedra, I don\'t have those statistics.\xc2\xa0 I think the Department of Justice might be able to help you on that.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President\xe2\x80\x99s focus in standing up this task force in the wake of the unrest in Ferguson was looking at the here and now, what is happening under this administration and what we can do to better address this.\xc2\xa0 So I know the recommendations that the task force put up apply to what the federal government is doing under the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch, and the policy changes that we announced yesterday and today will be in place moving forward.</p>\n<p>In terms of equipment that has gone out in years past, sometimes in decades past, they\xe2\x80\x99re drawn from different federal programs, so it\'s difficult for me to detail under which program every locality has those equipment, but maybe the Justice Department could be helpful to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They haven\'t even put inquiries yet, so that\'s why I was asking.\xc2\xa0 But back in December, Josh, in a briefing, had talked about these programs were useful to public safety and cited the response to the Boston Marathon bombing.\xc2\xa0 Do you all expect there could be an impact on public safety by taking these vehicles out of the local law enforcement hands?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I think part of the good work that was done through this working group was making sure that we did balance the needs of law enforcement with the sorts of equipment that we found contributed to unrest in communities.\xc2\xa0 So as you saw in the report, there was a set of controlled items that we believe are still appropriate to be deployed by local law enforcement.\xc2\xa0 Yet in deploying those, we\'ll look for more stringent protocols, more transparency and more accountability in terms of how that equipment is deployed.\xc2\xa0 And then there\xe2\x80\x99s also that set of banned items that will no longer be available for local law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on what kind of briefings the President is getting on the situation in Ramadi, and if he\xe2\x80\x99s reconsidering U.S. strategy there because of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Nedra.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Ramadi has been contested over the last 18 months.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve always known the fight against ISIL would be long and difficult, particularly in Anbar Province.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that this is, indeed, a setback.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s also no denying that we will help the Iraqis take back Ramadi.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is being kept up to date on the situation there.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any new strategy to preview or that\xe2\x80\x99s under contemplation right now, because as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said for a while now, this was going to be a long-term proposition, that there would be ebbs and flows in this fight.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Today, we are supporting the Iraqi security forces and the government of Iraq with precision airstrikes and advice to the Iraqi forces.\xc2\xa0 Our aircraft are in the air right now and searching for ISIL targets.\xc2\xa0 They will continue to do so until Ramadi is retaken.\xc2\xa0 In fact, we have conducted 32 airstrikes in Ramadi in the past three weeks, including eight over the past 24 hours.\xc2\xa0 These strikes will be continuing.\xc2\xa0 ISIL will ultimately be defeated in Ramadi and elsewhere in Iraq because we believe that Iraqi forces have the capacity to ultimately take Ramadi with coalition support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- take Ramadi back quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think our coalition will continue to launch airstrikes in the region.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to talk with Iraqi security forces how we can best support their operations there.\xc2\xa0 And we are, indeed, working closely with Prime Minister Abadi and Iraqi government on an appropriate response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the equipment ban, you mentioned that this is sort of a here and now and going forward policy.\xc2\xa0 Will this be in effect once the President leaves office?\xc2\xa0 Is this now the government policy going forward?\xc2\xa0 Or because it\xe2\x80\x99s part of an executive order, is this only in place for the life of his tenure?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, Julie, the equipment ban is in place effective immediately and it is part of an executive order.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it expires when he leaves office -- is that how that works?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 On Camden itself, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said and administration officials have been talking about how Camden is an example of a success story where community-oriented policing has really made a difference.\xc2\xa0 The ACLU and New Jersey and some of the other law enforcement organizations or civil rights organizations there have criticized what\xe2\x80\x99s gone on in Camden, saying that while there may have been some progress, there\xe2\x80\x99s been more incidents of routine and very minor stops for things like a broken light and that there\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a broken windows approach there.\xc2\xa0 And also a bunch of -- I think more than 60 incidents have an excessive use of force, most of which were later found to have been without foundation.\xc2\xa0 So I wonder if the President is aware of these.\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned about it?\xc2\xa0 Does he think that Camden is a success story, or do they still have a lot of work to do?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Julie, we think Camden does have a remarkable story of making significant success.\xc2\xa0 As you point out, they\xe2\x80\x99re not done.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of work to be done.</p>\n<p>In terms of the specifics you cited, I would refer you to the department, who can walk you through that.\xc2\xa0 We are fully aware of both the challenges that they face on the ground but also the progress they\xe2\x80\x99ve made.\xc2\xa0 I think it is important to point out the department has increased the number of their officers, has improved the environment in which the public can register the sort of complaints that you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, and also broaden the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive force\xe2\x80\x9d to capture more complaints.</p>\n<p>So part of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking about is increased transparency and increased accountability.\xc2\xa0 So I think that speaks directly to some of the concerns you\xe2\x80\x99ve raised.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that, overall, violent crime statistics show dramatic improvements in Camden in 2012m with\xc2\xa0 homicides down 47 percent, and shootings down 54 percent.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the average respond time to 911 calls is now less than five minutes -- down from more than 60 minutes three years ago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you say, generally, as part of the rationale for going to Camden that the President wants to actually praise some practices by police rather than just cracking down on some of the abuses we\'ve seen and some of the questionable practices like the use of military-style equipment?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, Julie.\xc2\xa0 In the wake of Ferguson, when the President stood up the Task Force on 21st Century Policing, part of what their mission was [was] to go out and look into the country and identify best practices from local law enforcement agencies around the country.\xc2\xa0 So, as you point out, there\xe2\x80\x99s been some situations that have seen unrest in communities that are particularly going through some challenging times.\xc2\xa0 But Camden is one of those places where they have been able to rebuild a relationship between law enforcement and the community they serve, really strengthen that relationship and bridge the gap that once existed of deep divide and deep mistrust.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to land in Philadelphia today.\xc2\xa0 Was any consideration given to visiting the site of the Amtrak derailment?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you for asking.\xc2\xa0 Upon landing in Philadelphia, the President will thank Mayor Nutter and the city\xe2\x80\x99s first responder team for their swift work to treat the wounded and save lives after the derailment of the Amtrak train last week.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll get a little bit more for you after this happens.\xc2\xa0 But when we land, the President is going to meet Senator Casey; Mayor Nutter; the Philadelphia Police Commissioner, Chuck Ramsey, who also chaired the task force; the Philadelphia Fire Commissioner, the Chief of Staff and Deputy Mayor of Public Safety for the city of Philadelphia; and the Director of Emergency Management of the city of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he consider visiting the site, as well?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 We plan on thanking the first responders there for their courageous actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that meeting.\xc2\xa0 Is it at the airport?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 It is at the airport.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best to get you a readout.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Up on the Hill, Mitch McConnell is floating a two-month extension of the Patriot Act because he doesn\'t think the USA Freedom Act, which you guys obviously support, has been worked out enough to get support among senators.\xc2\xa0 Would you guys be willing to sign that two-month extension?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Justin, our strategy on these important intelligence matters is to not kick the can down the road.\xc2\xa0 Congress has known of this impending deadline for months and months.\xc2\xa0 The June 1st expiration should not be taking anyone by surprise.\xc2\xa0 Republicans and Democrats alike have voiced resistance to a reauthorization of any length.\xc2\xa0 And as I noted on Friday, the House of Representatives passed the USA FREEDOM Act with a large bipartisan majority.\xc2\xa0 So this seems to be a piece of legislation that not only enjoys the President\xe2\x80\x99s support, but is supported by Republicans, Democrats, privacy experts, and our intelligence community.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On trade, two questions.\xc2\xa0 The first, both Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell expressed confidence over the weekend on the Sunday shows that trade would pass.\xc2\xa0 Do you guys share that confidence?\xc2\xa0 Do you think that you have the votes now?</p>\n<p>And then Elizabeth Warren today released a report saying that so far the Labor Department has been slow and ineffective in implementing existing labor protections, and making the argument that stuff that\'s baked into TPA would also be poorly implemented by the administration.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the trade protections, I would point out that the -- I didn\'t see the details of that, but I would just separate out TPP, which under the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, would for the first time have enforceable labor, human rights, and environmental standards.\xc2\xa0 I know in past agreements they were included on side deals and side notes and side letters.\xc2\xa0 This time, for the first time, it will be included in an enforceable way in the body of the text.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of passage in the United States Congress, I don\'t have an updated whip count for you.\xc2\xa0 I saw those comments on the Sunday shows, as well.\xc2\xa0 We are confident in our argument.\xc2\xa0 We\'re confident that these are the types of trade deals that will be good for the American worker, good for American jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one on the ISIS fighter that was killed over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, he was important enough for you guys to send in a mission into Syria.\xc2\xa0 But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t among the ISIS members that had a bounty on his head.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain sort of how important he was actually in the hierarchy at ISIS and how much you expect --</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, Justin.\xc2\xa0 We did seek to capture Abu Sayyaf because he\xe2\x80\x99s a senior ISIL leader who, among other things, had a senior role in overseeing ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas operations, which is a key source of revenue -- oil and gas operations, a key source of revenue that enables the terrorist organization to carry out their brutal tactics and oppress thousands of innocent civilians.\xc2\xa0 He was also involved with military operations.\xc2\xa0 He may have also been complicit in the enslavement of a young Yazidi woman that we rescued.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:43 P.M.
