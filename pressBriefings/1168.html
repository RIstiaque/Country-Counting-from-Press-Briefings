EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Just before I get started taking questions I would like to remind you, because it was such a busy end of the week last week, that the First Lady, Michelle Obama, and Dr. Jill Biden are launching a national initiative to support and honor America\xe2\x80\x99s service members and their families tomorrow, April 12th, at the White House.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The initiative aims to educate, challenge and spark action from all sectors of our society -- citizens, communities, businesses, nonprofits, faith-based institutions, philanthropic organizations, and government -- to ensure military families have the support they have earned.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMany of you saw this press release.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to remind you of it.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important event tomorrow that will begin several days of focus on this by the First Lady and Dr. Biden.\xc2\xa0 You also are aware, of course, that General McChrystal has been asked to -- and accepted -- the job of leading the advisory panel that will oversee this effort.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWith that, I will start with your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on the spending debate.\xc2\xa0 I want to come back to this quote that then-Senator Obama had in 2006, when he voted against extending the debt limit, and he called it a sign of leadership failure in terms of potentially raising the limit, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of the country\xe2\x80\x99s financing the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s reckless fiscal policies.\xc2\xa0 Now, of course, he and the administration are saying it\xe2\x80\x99s urgent to extend that debt limit again.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain, since this is back in the news, why that is not hypocrisy?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, Ben, is the President, as David Plouffe said yesterday, regrets that vote and thinks it was a mistake.\xc2\xa0 He realizes now that raising the debt ceiling is so important to the health of this economy and the global economy that it is not a vote that, even when you are protesting an administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies, you can play around with.\xc2\xa0 And you need to take very seriously the need to raise the debt limit so that the full faith and credit of the United States government is maintained around the globe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe consequences, as Secretary Geithner and many others, including the Speaker of the House, Senator Minority Leader, Congressman Ryan have pointed out, the consequences of not -- of failing to raise the debt ceiling would be Armageddon-like in terms of the economy on -- the impact on interest rates, on job creation, on growth would be devastating.\xc2\xa0 Others outside of government, including former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, S&amp;P chief economist David Weiss, for example, said that it could cause significant and long-lasting financial and economic disruption.\xc2\xa0 JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone wants to push that button -- i.e. fail to raise the debt ceiling, which I think would be catastrophic and unpredictable, I think they\xe2\x80\x99re crazy.\xe2\x80\x9c<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe point is that the President, through his actions both in the first two years in office when he demonstrated through the way he created the health care recovery -- rather the health care act, the Affordable Care Act, with its deficit reduction built into it, through his signing -- or rather his agreement on Friday to enact the deepest discretionary spending cuts in history, has shown that he is committed to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And we do not need to play chicken with our economy by linking the raising of the debt ceiling to anything.\xc2\xa0 We should do that right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He cast that vote five years ago and issued those strongly stated views, and as recently as earlier this year, I believe, Jake asked your predecessor about this and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that it was a mistake.\xc2\xa0 When did the President come to realization this was a mistake?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we asked him and he made clear that he now believes it was a mistake.\xc2\xa0 And he understands that when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the legislature, when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the Senate, you want to make clear your position if you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with policies of the administration.\xc2\xa0 But there are many other ways to do it and -- I would say.\xc2\xa0 And also, there is the fact in this case that the efforts to link this to the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to deficit reduction are unnecessary precisely because he has demonstrated his commitments so clearly, and will again on Wednesday when he lays out his vision for long-term deficit reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment is established.\xc2\xa0 The economic impact of holding hostage the debt ceiling vote to other considerations would be catastrophic, so I think the need to move on this is quite clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question about that speech you just mentioned.\xc2\xa0 To the degree you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to frame it at this point, should the American people expect this to be a speech in which President Obama literally lays out a plan with specifics akin to the budget for Representative Ryan, or should we expecting more a speech about principles and goals and not specificity?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to do, Ben, is not preview the speech in any detail.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like the President to speak for himself on Wednesday, but he will very clearly lay out his vision for deficit reduction -- the need for it to be balanced; the need for it to be bipartisan; the need for it to address the long-term drivers of our debt and for everyone to share in the burden of bringing our fiscal house into order.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not get into the details; I\xe2\x80\x99d rather him do it on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, Jay, staying with the debt and the deficit, on the debt limit, are you explicitly ruling out attaching any specific spending cuts, since Republicans have clearly said that they will be seeking large spending concessions to agree on raising the debt limit?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without negotiating from here I will say that we support -- we believe that we should move quickly to raise the debt limit and we support a clean piece of legislation to do that.\xc2\xa0 Concurrently -- not linked, but concurrently, the President is going to demonstrate on Wednesday his commitment, again, to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We believe that having -- that he has established that and he will again.\xc2\xa0 He looks forward to working together with members of Congress in both parties to find a resolution to our long-term fiscal issues that is bipartisan and can be supported by the American people and that is good for the American economy and the American people.\xc2\xa0 And he believes, separately we should raise the debt limit so that all the good work that has been done to move this economy forward, to create an atmosphere now where we are growing regularly now -- quarter by quarter, where we are creating jobs month by month -- that all that progress is not put into jeopardy because that is what would happen if we were not to raise the debt ceiling.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So specifically on the strategy, would you envisage a bipartisan process; you have the Gang of Six out there?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has said as he noted in his State of the Union and has noted since that there has been a lot of good work on the issue.\xc2\xa0 He believes that the fiscal commission that he set up last year and that reported its findings at the end of last year helped create an environment unlike any we have seen in Washington in recent years that creates the potential for bipartisan cooperation and compromise on these very difficult issues that require -- in the way that compromise is defined -- require everyone to give a little bit, to not get 100 percent of what they want.\xc2\xa0 So he looks forward to working with members of Congress of all kinds, and he thinks that there are -- there is ample evidence that the potential for finding common ground is there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on the deficit speech, why Wednesday?\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t he lay out his plan in the budget proposal?\xc2\xa0 Republicans are saying this is evidence of failure of leadership.\xc2\xa0 Are they wrong?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I appreciate the question because leadership is not about, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, laying out positions to score political points.\xc2\xa0 He made a very deliberate decision as we looked forward to this year and as the year began that he would -- because he was serious about the need to address long-term deficit reduction and debt, that he would put forward the 2012 budget that makes a serious down payment, that demonstrates his commitment to deficit reduction -- more than $1 trillion in deficit reduction, which I think we need to remind everyone who is watching and reading -- that the President laid forward that plan, that 2012 plan two months ago, and does it in a balanced way with spending cuts, tax expenditures, and in a way that protects the very investments that will help us grow in the future in education and innovation, research and development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he also said that he looked forward to working in a bipartisan way, to having a conversation with those lawmakers who are committed to doing something about this in a reasonable -- taking a reasonable and calm approach.\xc2\xa0 And the decision was putting up a specific plan at that time with a lot of details was a way to reduce your chances of success.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe environment for the speech he will deliver on Wednesday is -- we are now in a situation, having accomplished what was accomplished on Friday in reaching an agreement on fiscal year spending in 2011 that includes the deepest spending cuts in history -- discretionary spending cuts in history -- and the greatest spending cuts as a percentage of GDP since 1982, Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s first term -- we have an environment now, having dealt with last year\xe2\x80\x99s business, where we can move forward and tackle some of these long-term issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut the 2012 budget that he put forward is very much a down payment on that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very much a blueprint for the kind of balanced approach he believes needs to be taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner says there\'s not a chance -- to quote him -- not a chance that that ceiling will be raised without significant spending cuts attached to it.\xc2\xa0 So your position that you want it to be clean seems to be a non-starter on Capitol Hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will remind you of something that the Speaker said earlier this year:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were to fail to increase the debt limit, we would send our economy into a tailspin.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He also said, \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial disaster not only for our country but for the worldwide economy.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t create jobs if you default on the federal debt.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 We could not have said it better.\xc2\xa0 That is a vivid description of why this is such an important vote and why you cannot hold it hostage to something else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to deficit reduction has been established -- was established on Friday, was established in his 2012 budget proposal, was established in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression in the way he drew up and worked with Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act -- which it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember when we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the drivers of long-term debt we\xe2\x80\x99re talking in many ways, at least in sizeable measure, health care spending -- and that measure as scored by independent economists reduces the deficit by $200 billion in 10 years, and more than $1 trillion over 20 -- again, demonstrating the seriousness with which he takes the need to address the deficit and the long-term debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 These spending cuts that you\xe2\x80\x99re heralding, the biggest spending cuts since the Reagan years, that won\xe2\x80\x99t even pay for what we\xe2\x80\x99re borrowing this month.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I agree that the reality of our one-year -- our six-month now -- continuing resolution is that it is but a portion of the problem and a small slice.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an argument that we were making for a long time in urging Congress to get done with that work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWhat it does do is demonstrate a commitment to spending reduction, spending cuts -- and a commitment to making tough choices that are not the kinds of choices in an ideal world the President would want to make or that Democrats would want to make.\xc2\xa0 But it shows his willingness to compromise and find common ground; that it can be done if we all work together, we\xe2\x80\x99re all reasonable and we\xe2\x80\x99re all willing to retain our principles, retain our priorities, but be willing to negotiate on the issues in a way that allows us to reach an agreement.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just for the government to continue functioning until the end of next year the debt ceiling will need to be raised about $1.9 trillion.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re heralding $38.5 billion\xc2\xa0 -- or let\xe2\x80\x99s make it $78.5 billion -- either way, what you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about as representing a commitment by the President is a drop of water in the ocean.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing.\xc2\xa0 And so I don\'t understand how you can say this demonstrates a commitment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I would say -- first of all, your disinterest -- or dismissal of the size of the spending cuts is remarkable given the intense interest in every half billion dollars as recently as last week on the hour.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo all of these things are difficult.\xc2\xa0 And what was established on Friday was that if the leaders stay focused on the need to do what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American economy and what\xe2\x80\x99s right for the American people, they can reach an agreement that is good for the American economy and good for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd these things build on themselves, we hope.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the bipartisan tax cut that the President signed into law in December -- which no one in this room I daresay would have predicted in the wake of the midterm elections as a possible outcome -- has done, A, laid a predicate for that kind of bipartisan cooperation that we need in divided government; and, B, had a great deal and has had a great deal of positive impact on the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEconomists independent from the White House, independent from Congress, will tell you that it has added significantly to our growth so far.\xc2\xa0 So that lays a predicate.\xc2\xa0 The agreement that we reached on Friday -- that the President reached on Friday laid a predicate.\xc2\xa0 All of this stuff is hard.\xc2\xa0 All of these negotiations will be difficult.\xc2\xa0 But what I think the American people should take away from what they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen happen in recent days is that there is reason to hope that we can work together and get the work done that the American people expect us to get done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last thing.\xc2\xa0 Could you -- does the White House have any comment on the latest from Libya, the negotiations with the African Union and Colonel Qaddafi, and then also, about the latest from the Ivory Coast in terms of Gbagbo being imprisoned? I don\'t know if you have comments on either one of those.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are glad to see that Mr. Gbagbo has been arrested, because, as you know, we have made clear that he was no longer the legitimate President of the country, that the elections that displaced him were free and fair.\xc2\xa0 And we have supported the efforts of those who would bring him -- convince him to remove himself from power.\xc2\xa0 And we have been very involved in the effort at the international community level to help make that happen.\xc2\xa0 So we welcome that development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd on Syria, I would say that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, on Libya.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Feel free to add Syria, too.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can also -- you can tell that the unrest in the region is broad, right?\xc2\xa0 But in Libya, our response to the \xe2\x80\x9ccease-fire\xe2\x80\x9d is that what matters here are actions and not words.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd Colonel Qaddafi and his forces, his regime know full well what they need to do.\xc2\xa0 They need to stop menacing the civilians -- citizens of Libya.\xc2\xa0 They need to pull back from the cities.\xc2\xa0 They need to garrison themselves, the forces, and then that would be a good development.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut we are in no way pausing.\xc2\xa0 We are in no way letting up. The implementation in every aspect of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 continues, and will continue as long as necessary.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to pursue our diplomatic and economic measures to tighten the noose around Qaddafi and those members of his regime who continue to try to cling to power in order to achieve the result of having him step down from power, so that the Libyan people can decide their future and pick a government and leaders who will respond to their aspirations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you talk about the drivers of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt, David on the talk shows said, well, Social Security is not one of them right now, not driving up the numbers.\xc2\xa0 The President is open to having that be part of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 When the fight is already going to be hard enough in getting some things moving, why add a hot-button issue like Social Security to the discussion?\xc2\xa0 Why add it into the mix if the fight is already going to be hard enough without this element?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what Mr. Plouffe said was that the President has, for a long time and certainly in the State of the Union speech, made clear that, A, we do not believe that Social Security is driving our deficit problems in the near and medium term, and that -- but he also welcomes efforts to further strengthen Social Security for the long term.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the President\xe2\x80\x99s position and that\'s the position David Plouffe was echoing yesterday on the Sunday shows.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s plan -- I know last year -- last week, rather -- when asked about it, you kind of said let\xe2\x80\x99s get past 2011 and then we can talk about 2012.\xc2\xa0 So on the 2012 budget, are there any elements, is their any aspect that the President agrees with of the -- that he can agree to in the Ryan plan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he agrees with the goal that we need to address our fiscal issues, the things that are driving and creating debt and driving our deficits.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tWe strongly disagree with the lack of balance in Congressman Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s approach.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s simply -- we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate and it would not be supported by the American people to have a fiscal plan that relies on dramatic restructuring reform of the kind of programs that provide security and health security to seniors and to poor people and disabled people, and at the same time gives enormous tax relief, tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAgain, we understand that people will come to the table with different views.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that we have to have balance, we have to -- and that we have to be sure that we protect the most vulnerable in this nation as we approach this problem.\xc2\xa0 And the plan that Congressman Ryan laid out does not do that.\xc2\xa0 It fails the test of reaching that balance.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And while we\xe2\x80\x99re not getting into the details, Medicare and Medicaid are on the table in part of the discussion.\xc2\xa0 Our polling shows that any kind of cut to Medicare and Medicaid is overwhelming -- they\xe2\x80\x99re overwhelmingly against, Americans are.\xc2\xa0 Forget about convincing Congress.\xc2\xa0 How does the President convince the American people it\xe2\x80\x99s worth taking on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kate, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics about the vision the President will lay out on Wednesday.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is the President understands very well that health care spending is a major driver of our deficit and debt problem.\xc2\xa0 And he has shown his understanding of that by the way he addressed it in the Affordable Care Act and achieved savings in that that will save over a trillion dollars over 20 years.\xc2\xa0 He has shown it in his 2012 budget proposal, which achieves another $60-plus billion in reductions.\xc2\xa0 He believes that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 We can achieve those savings in ways that protect the people that these programs are supposed to and were designed to support and help.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And even more than that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to preview the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that it will be a balanced -- that he believes that we have to have a balanced approach; that these things have to be on the table and we have to approach them in a balanced way and make sure that the programs that -- or the approach that we take in the end, in this bipartisan compromise that he hopes we achieve, is balanced in terms of the sacrifice it requires, and that it protects the very things that we need to invest in, in order to continue to grow in the 21st century -- because growth is one of the most important things in terms of creating the economic environment that allows us to drive down the debt and the deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get very far, no matter now many times you -- how many programs you cut, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t grow -- if the economy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t grow and jobs aren\xe2\x80\x99t created.\xc2\xa0 It makes it very, very difficult.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s another reason, going back to the debt ceiling, that it would be a catastrophic folly not to raise the debt ceiling at a time when growth and job creation are moving forward and helping us pull ourselves out of this recession, put people back to work, and create an economic environment that will allow us to address our deficit and debt issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just a point of clarification.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure -- is the President telling the Republicans that he will not sign a debt limit bill unless it\xe2\x80\x99s clean?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that we support a clean piece of legislation to raise the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 What I won\xe2\x80\x99t do from here is pretend that you\xe2\x80\x99re John Boehner and I\xe2\x80\x99m the President and hash it out.\xc2\xa0 But our position is clear for all the reasons that I\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out, that Speaker Boehner has laid out, that Congressman Ryan has laid out, economists and other have laid out -- that we cannot play chicken with the economy in this way.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just too darn risky.\xc2\xa0 It is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that exactly what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing, setting up a game of chicken by saying you want a clean bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we\xe2\x80\x99re saying that this is an issue that everyone agrees -- every leader in Congress of both parties agrees has to be done.\xc2\xa0 So it will be done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why not compromise?\xc2\xa0 Just like the budget bill you just did, that you started at -- you started at zero, they started at 61, and you worked your way to a reasonable compromise.\xc2\xa0 Why not just say --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- just say that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do here?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is the effect on the economy of playing that kind of brinksmanship would be too severe, too catastrophic.\xc2\xa0 It would send all the wrong signals to the markets and to those who --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you suggesting to compromise would send the wrong signals?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, to hold hostage a vote in return for an exchange for some proposal that one party wants is not the way to treat this issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s too dangerous to do it that way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just confused by that.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the dangerous thing to play chicken rather than compromising?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And the danger --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\'t you --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, we\xe2\x80\x99re saying -- and we can do this four or five times, but I think your colleagues would probably get a little disappointed if we did that, especially since I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it already.\xc2\xa0 But the dangerous thing would be to hold hostage the simple raising of the debt limit, which everyone agrees has to be done regardless.\xc2\xa0 In those statements I read you, they were not linked; they were not equivocal; they were, regardless, we have to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo we should do it.\xc2\xa0 And we are, at the same time, showing how serious the President is -- the President is showing how serious he is about moving off of Friday\xe2\x80\x99s agreement towards having a serious conversation about the long-term deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 On the deal that was reached on Friday night, we still haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen much in the way of details.\xc2\xa0 Dan Pfeiffer did post a piece and said that there will be $13 billion in cuts from Labor, Education and HHS, for example.\xc2\xa0 Do we have any details?\xc2\xa0 Or do the details exist, and you\xe2\x80\x99re just not telling us what they are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, what was agreed upon on Friday night was a fairly detailed framework that includes some of the things that -- I mean, that includes the things that Dan laid out, and the leaders agreed on it and now up on the Hill the fine print is being worked out.\xc2\xa0 But the outlines of the agreement were very clear and were agreed on by the leaders, and that process is now proceeding up on the Hill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tThe reason why we needed a short-term CR was because of the way the Hill works and legislation is written, and it takes a little bit of time.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what\'s happening now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect the President to embrace the work of Simpson-Bowles and their team on Wednesday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll repeat what I said about that, which he thinks that the work they did was extremely important.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with every line of it, every proposal in it, but it was very important.\xc2\xa0 And it helped create the environment that we\xe2\x80\x99re in now that -- in which we find Republicans and Democrats who are serious, willing to address this issue in a serious way, which starts with an understanding that you cannot do this unless you do it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 The fiscal commission showed that you need to look at entitlements, you need to look at tax expenditures, you need to look at military spending.\xc2\xa0 You need to look at all of these issues.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t simply slash entitlements, lower taxes, and call that a fair deal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo while he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with every line of it, he thinks it was important work and helped create the ground that we stand on now that leads him to be optimistic that if we\xe2\x80\x99re all serious, if the leaders are all serious, as we move forward, that we can actually get something substantial accomplished for the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Reid the other night said that he would not support tinkering with Social Security.\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency.\xc2\xa0 Does that say to the White House that Social Security as part of a debt-deficit plan may be a nonstarter in the Senate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Mike, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview what the President will say on Wednesday except to make note, as I did earlier, that what the President has said is that he also believes that Social Security is not the issue when it comes to our short- and medium-term deficit problems.\xc2\xa0 But he also does -- would look at ways of strengthening Social Security to ensuring that it provides needed benefits to recipients going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to preview what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tChuck.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the goal of this -- when you guys make this ask to raise the debt ceiling the last ask you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to ask for it to be raised big enough to the point where you get to the year where in your budget you get to primary balance, which I think is 2017 -- which is a zero deficit -- running zero yearly deficits?\xc2\xa0 Is that the goal with this debt ceiling vote, to get to that so it\xe2\x80\x99s the last one he asks for?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, that\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I confess I do not know specifically what -- the Secretary of Treasury has, as early as last January, spelled out our position on this, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Treasury would be a better place to go for the answer to that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And going back to Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question, I mean, you guys do -- when you want to issue a veto threat, you make it known.\xc2\xa0 So if you have not issued one, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it fair for us to realize you have not issued a veto threat?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Veto threat of what?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of a non-clean debt ceiling extension.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of a piece of legislation that we need to issue a veto threat on.\xc2\xa0 We are making clear what our position is, and the Secretary of Treasury has also made clear, going back to January, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that we\xe2\x80\x99re not suddenly paying attention to this issue.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to members of Congress about this for a number of months because it\xe2\x80\x99s so important.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s our position.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of issuing veto threats.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of making it clear to everyone in Washington and around the country how important this issue is.\xc2\xa0 And I know it\xe2\x80\x99s esoteric to a lot of Americans, understandably, who have their own --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re knee-jerk against it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, their own problems to deal with.\xc2\xa0 And the best way to explain it is that the United States, the most powerful economy in the world, it needs to be creditworthy.\xc2\xa0 The impact of anything that it would do, that the Congress would do that suggests that the United States was not creditworthy would be calamitous.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd I think that\'s something that I think Americans can understand.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it can be framed in a way that sounds bad politically, but the reality is the United States is the largest economy in the world, it is looked to around the globe as the anchor of the world economy, and must establish through this vote its creditworthiness.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair -- there were a lot of Republicans over the last few months on this issue of the debt ceiling, they said, look, we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider it if the President will talk -- get serious about entitlement reform.\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to say Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech is an attempt to -- because you said it\xe2\x80\x99s not reactive, but it\xe2\x80\x99s concurrent -- is it fair to say that that -- that you hope Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech, that those members who called for the President to get more serious on entitlement reform that they view the speech as, okay, he gave his way, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the next --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to project upon members of Congress what action they will take after hearing the President speak.\xc2\xa0 But I will say the speech will once again demonstrate the President\xe2\x80\x99s seriousness about deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that it will signal to members of Congress in both parties that he wants to work with them in a bipartisan way to address these issues that are important, that affect our capacity to dominate economically in the 21st century the way we did in the 20th -- to win the future.\xc2\xa0 And part of winning the future is making sure that we have our fiscal house in order, and he looks forward to working with Republicans and Democrats to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any regrets that you\xe2\x80\x99re allowing -- that you basically threw Washington, D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s government and the residents -- used them as a negotiating tool during these last-minute talks, saying, okay, you can let the budget restrict this or restrict that, and demonstrate once again to the residents of Washington, D.C. that they do not have self-rule?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, I would just say that the President made clear the lines he would not cross in the CR negotiations, and one line he would --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for 50 states but not the District of Columbia --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- one line he would not cross, which has been made amply clear I think in some of the reporting on the negotiations, was the insistence -- repetitive insistence by the Republicans that a measure be included that defunded a program that gives family planning services and women\xe2\x80\x99s health services to poor people across the country.\xc2\xa0 He would not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is it only being restricted in Washington, D.C.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He also has said from the beginning that we have to make tough choices and he has to agree to things that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree -- in an ideal world would not want to agree to.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of compromise.\xc2\xa0 You don\'t get everything you want.\xc2\xa0 But if you know what you\xe2\x80\x99re about and you know what your priorities are, you protect the very essential things that are so important to growing the economy and making sure we out-compete the rest of the world in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the Republican budget, which cuts entitlements and lowers taxes is not a balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 By a corollary, is it also not a balanced approach to have a budget that increases taxes on the wealthy but does not reduce entitlement benefits?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that\'s an effort to try to get me to preview what the President\xe2\x80\x99s going to say, except that I would say that balance includes shared sacrifice.\xc2\xa0 And the President has made clear that -- by his actions that he understands that health care is one of the major driving factors in our deficit and debt.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s shown he understands that by the deficit reduction he has already put into place.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tIt says a lot about the environment that we work and live in and the tumult we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through in the past several years that the fact that this President signed into law a bill that reduces the deficit via health care savings by over a trillion dollars doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get acknowledged as often as it should for its deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 But he continues to show in his 2012 budget proposal that savings in health care are essential to any balanced approach.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So additional savings?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Savings in health care are essential to any balanced approach.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to say something specific about what the President is going to say, which I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do.\xc2\xa0 I think \xe2\x80\x9csavings in health care are essential to any balanced approach\xe2\x80\x9d is pretty clear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, just returning for a moment to the debt limit issue.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday on Meet the Press, David Plouffe said that, when he was talking about raising the debt limit, he said, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to raise the debt limit.\xc2\xa0 Everybody has said this, so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it.\xc2\xa0 But in that process we should be able to reduce the deficit -- was how he put it.\xc2\xa0 And that was read by some as an openness to linking the two together.\xc2\xa0 Was that a misread?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and he was not linking the two.\xc2\xa0 What he was making is the point that I\xe2\x80\x99ve made, which is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s demonstration of his commitment to deficit reduction continues.\xc2\xa0 It has been made already in the first few years he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office.\xc2\xa0 It was demonstrated with his 2012 budget proposal, a trillion -- a more than a trillion dollars in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It was demonstrated again when he came to an agreement with Speaker Boehner and Senator Reid to cut discretionary spending more significantly than ever before.\xc2\xa0 And it will be demonstrated again amply on Wednesday when he gives a speech -- Wednesday, as I said, early afternoon at George Washington University.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Wednesday at GW, early in the afternoon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are still waiting.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a time.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have the details for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake, when did the President decide he needed to give a speech on deficit reduction?\xc2\xa0 Was it during the final days leading up to the agreement on Friday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s been long planned.\xc2\xa0 And this is a question that I appreciate, Mark, because as I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this job and been up close to the President and the way he thinks about these issues, this is very instructive, because sometimes in a way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy the press and doesn\'t satisfy others in Washington, he approaches his engagement in these issues always with an eye to where do I want to go; what is the result I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to achieve?\xc2\xa0 And he has been thinking about this for a long time.\xc2\xa0 He telegraphed that in his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 And he was thinking about it beforehand in the discussions that led up to how he would approach this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tHe would have, under any circumstances, whether there had been -- if there had never been a showdown over a shutdown, if there had never been a dispute over fiscal year 2011 spending, he was committed to addressing our deficits and debt this year, this spring.\xc2\xa0 And he will do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he will continue to engage in the way that he engaged in the CR negotiations, which is to view every phone call he makes and meeting he has and public appearance he makes as an opportunity not to score political points, not to win the day, but to advance the cause of finding a way to do the business that the American people want us to do.\xc2\xa0 And that might sound corny, but it really is the way he approaches it.\xc2\xa0 And he will do it while protecting the principles that he thinks are so important.<br/>\n\tBut to answer your question, he\xe2\x80\x99s been thinking about this for a very long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think I\'d be on safe ground with this because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about kind of the President\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on this and not previewing what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say -- but who all has he consulted with outside the White House on this?\xc2\xa0 His jobs council?\xc2\xa0 His export council?\xc2\xa0 Some of them have been pretty clear that the deficit is a long-term deterrent to growth.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you just talked about some of the phone calls he\xe2\x80\x99s made.\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s he talking to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to reveal the phone calls and meetings that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t read out, but I can tell you that he has had discussions about this with a number of people and stakeholders beyond the circle of Congress and his administration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that includes the business community?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Of course it includes the business community. And it includes labor and it includes all sorts of individuals and groups that he comes into contact with.\xc2\xa0 And as part of his\xc2\xa0 -- part of the way he conducts his presidency, he has those conversations about this issue and a variety of others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he gone back to Simpson or Bowles?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into individual conversations he\xe2\x80\x99s had or meetings he\xe2\x80\x99s had.\xc2\xa0 I think I pointed out that he appreciates greatly the work that Erskine Bowles and Senator Simpson did and feels like it created a framework that may help us reach a deal and a compromise.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, do you have Tom Donilon\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Saudi Arabia?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The National Security Advisor, as you know, is traveling to the region, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to meet with key leaders in each country and discuss regional issues.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going in the region, and he looks forward to meeting with King Abdullah in Riyadh, and in Abu Dhabi he will meet with the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.\xc2\xa0 And it underscores the importance of the relationship we have with both countries.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to do certainly with the Crown Prince is discuss its participation, the UAE\xe2\x80\x99s participation, in the coalition, its active participation in the enforcement of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How is the relationship with Saudi Arabia?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our relationship is very strong with Saudi Arabia.\xc2\xa0 It continues to be, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important relationship. This is part of the kind of conversations we have with leaders of Saudi Arabia regularly.\xc2\xa0 Other leaders of the administration have visited and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had meetings and phone calls on a regular basis.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just on the timing of the speech and when the President considered and when he thought it was best to give it, did you ever give any consideration that giving the speech after his own presentation of his budget for 2012, but before the Republicans did their long-term one is -- having him second to the Republicans makes it sound like he said, well, let them lead on this issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Mark, here\xe2\x80\x99s the point -- he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t second.\xc2\xa0 He put forward a 2012 budget proposal that reduced the deficit by over a trillion dollars and included within it the kind of balance that he thinks is essential to deal with our longer-term deficit and debt issues.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that it was a down payment towards the longer-term goal.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said he was going to be talking later about Medicare and some of these issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And he believes that the approach he took was the smart one to create -- to help foster the environment that will hopefully enable us to reach bipartisan compromise on an admittedly very difficult issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think that by letting Republicans touch the third rail first he\xe2\x80\x99s made himself look less than leader-like?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he has demonstrated ample leadership.\xc2\xa0 I think that the compromise that was reached on Friday would not have occurred without President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, as I think has been made clear by some of the reporting on the process.\xc2\xa0 I think the bipartisan deal that gave tax cuts to working Americans, including a payroll tax holiday that is helping Americans deal every week with higher gas prices and helping drive economic growth in 2011, would not have been reached without presidential leadership.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tNone of these things happen without presidential leadership. And how you decide to use your political capital, use your capacity to lead, is very important.\xc2\xa0 And what he decided he did not want to do was draw some lines when he felt at the time that the best way to approach it was to call for a bipartisan conversation and to create an environment where real compromise can be achieved, and not to win a political argument.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Could I thank you for your kindness to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lester, let me get to a few others.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, wait, it was my turn next.\xc2\xa0 Everybody on this row has --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get to -- but that row is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted to thank you for your kindness --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate your -- let me call on --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This question is about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chicago on Thursday.\xc2\xa0 There are no official events on the schedule that I see, but I see now that he\xe2\x80\x99s staying overnight.\xc2\xa0 So is there -- do you expect that something will be added?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more scheduling events to announce at this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the DNC pick up the costs for that trip?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why don\'t I take that question -- I don\'t have the answer to that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you also know, will the First Lady be coming to Chicago also --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take that.\xc2\xa0 I confess that I spent most of my time preparing for this briefing, focused on putting on a green eyeshade and becoming an economist.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re not an economist, you said.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The whole speech -- I know he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t given the speech yet, but what kind of strategy do you see him -- or how do you think he\xe2\x80\x99ll approach this in terms of getting an agreement with the Hill?\xc2\xa0 Will he deputize Lew and others?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what will his approach be after that?\xc2\xa0 And what is his goal in mind in terms of when he -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s not this, if it\xe2\x80\x99s not the debt limit, what is that endgame for him in terms of getting something from Congress?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that precisely his desire to reach a result prohibits me from playing out our strategy from the podium before he\xe2\x80\x99s even given his speech.\xc2\xa0 He will speak to this on Wednesday, and obviously we will continue to fill in details in terms of how we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching it and how we believe the process should work in the days going forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tApril.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two things.\xc2\xa0 One, when has the President talked to Ban Ki-moon about the Ivory Coast?\xc2\xa0 Did they talk about things leading up to the events today?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to get back to you.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you could check with Tommy or Caitlin about conversations specifically with the U.N. Secretary General about the Ivory Coast.\xc2\xa0 He is -- the President is engaged on this virtually every day during this time, and has -- you know about the video that he taped and the calls we have made and the engagement we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with the United Nations, which, by the way, you know has a security presence in the Ivory Coast.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tSo in terms of specific conversations with the Secretary General, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to get back to you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And also, on the budget, leading into everything that was happening Friday, Americans were very concerned, Americans were speaking out, they were very upset, they were scared about budget cuts; they were scared about losing jobs; they were scared about not being able to get their IRS checks, possibly.\xc2\xa0 Do you know if they mailed them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd then we saw Saturday, the President reached out to America for about 10 minutes at the Lincoln Memorial, understanding there was a concern.\xc2\xa0 Wednesday, what is the President going to promise Americans?\xc2\xa0 After all of this emotional mish-mosh over the budget, what is he going to promise America Wednesday at G.W.?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Without getting into the specifics or previewing the speech, I will tell you that he will promise to approach this issue the same way he approached the CR, which is he wakes up every morning thinking about what can I do to advance the cause of growing the economy and creating jobs?\xc2\xa0 What can I do to make sure that Americans who are looking for work can find work?\xc2\xa0 And what can I make sure I don\'t do that would in any way jeopardize those goals?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd he will -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing more than -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that matters to him more than this.\xc2\xa0 And for those who have doubted -- for reasons that I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to deficit reduction, it has been amply demonstrated\xc2\xa0 -- because he sees it not as a goal unto itself; he sees it as part of his overall vision for growing the economy and making sure that America in the 21st century is as great and as strong and prosperous and fair as it became as we worked so hard -- as Americans worked so hard in the 20th century to make it what it is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd that\'s -- that animates everything he does when it comes to domestic policy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s going to animate his speech on Wednesday.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tYes, Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 Number one, has the President, or will the President sit down or meet in person with Stan McChrystal as part of his re-engagement with Mrs. Obama on this thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tAnd then secondly, I wanted to -- my question was sort of like Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give it another shot anyway -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s more basic.\xc2\xa0 Given the makeup of the House Republican caucus right now and the nature of the CR fight that\'s past, the nature of the debt ceiling fight that\'s looming, does the President really expect that whatever he lays out on Wednesday is going to yield any actual legislative action by the 2012 elections?\xc2\xa0 Or is this more that he feels it\xe2\x80\x99s important to try to move the ball forward, moving it forward, looking into 2013 before --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know he very much hopes and believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility for -- if everyone approaches it in a responsible way, with a commitment to try to get something done and to compromising, he very much believes that this can produce real legislation, tangible results.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Before the election?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct, before the 2012 election.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that he very much believes it can and should happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on the McChrystal question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 I should know, but I don\'t.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\tGeorge.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What efforts are you making, if any, to get information on or to secure the release of the four journalists, two of them Americans, who were detained in Libya last Tuesday?\xc2\xa0 Three of them including Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s Clare Gillis were last seen Thursday in a Libya detention center?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 George, we\xe2\x80\x99ve very aware of this issue, and I know the State Department is working very hard in order to do what it can to facilitate those journalists\xe2\x80\x99 release.\xc2\xa0 But obviously I don\'t want to go into detail about what they\'re doing, but they would have more information in terms of what they could discuss.\xc2\xa0 But be assured that they are working on it and that we take this very, very seriously, as we did when other journalists were detained.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there concern in those past cases that you cited, they\xe2\x80\x99ve always let the journalists talk to a Western embassy or something -- that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to in any way say something that prejudices this situation.\xc2\xa0 But there is great concern.\xc2\xa0 We call on -- around the world, but specifically in this case, for the release of any journalist detained, any human rights activist, anyone detained unlawfully or inappropriately, and in this case, specifically with those journalists in mind, we call on and demand their release.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Andrei, kak dela.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow is the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin\xe2\x80\x99s flight into space.\xc2\xa0 Can we expect anything from the White House on that?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- a Sputnik moment.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wish I had the great one-liner, in Russian or in English, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what we have on that, but we certainly congratulate the Russian people on that historic accomplishment.\xc2\xa0 We got to the moon first, but -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 You have to check the transcript.\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- really, it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing thing, and I know from having lived in Moscow the way that Yuri Gagarin was revered for his tremendous accomplishment.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you deny reports that the White House has been quietly urging Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you except that we believe very firmly that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t deny it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the two states need -- in order to achieve a two-state solution to this, where Israel and the Palestinian people live together side by side, peacefully and securely, the two sides need to sit down and negotiate a compromise.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President --<br/>\n<br/>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I have.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Lester.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:37 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
