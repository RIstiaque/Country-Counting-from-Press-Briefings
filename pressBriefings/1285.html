GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Before we start, let me just do a couple of -- just one quick scheduling announcement for tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thursday, the President will host two events focusing on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s work to increase America\xe2\x80\x99s competitiveness and ensure long-term economic growth.\xc2\xa0 In the morning, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Export Council will meet to discuss the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing commitment to export promotion.\xc2\xa0 In the afternoon, the President will make an announcement on the expansion of his \xe2\x80\x9cEducate To Innovate\xe2\x80\x9d initiative to improve science, technology, engineering and math education in order to better prepare students to lead in the 21st century economy.</p>\n<p>Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s events highlight the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to doubling exports in the next five years, while laying the groundwork in preparing our workforce to lead the world in this global economy.</p>\n<p>And with that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be a spray or anything?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99re both -- well, the second event I know there\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and I think the first event I presume there will be a spray.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions on tax cuts, which the President is really laying out as a wedge issue for the election.\xc2\xa0 But there seems to be a lot of divisiveness among Democrats on the Hill.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to ask Democrats to bring a vote to the floor on Wednesday to cut taxes only for the middle class, ahead of November elections?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\'m not going to get into what Congress may or may not decide to do in terms of how they want to bring certain things to the floor or what have you.\xc2\xa0 I will reiterate what the President has said, that we should -- as you heard him say on a number of occasions last week -- make middle- class tax cuts permanent and not hold the middle class hostage in that to borrowing $700 billion for tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>If you listen to part of what Congressman Boehner said over the weekend, there appeared, at least earlier in the week, to be a willingness to go along with that.\xc2\xa0 We would certainly hope that there would be a willingness to go along with that.\xc2\xa0 It appears as if that has largely been walked back to the original position of holding the middle class hostage and the price of that, the ransom price for that is $700 billion that we can\'t afford.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now that the President has put this issue out there in the forefront doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he have to take some type of ownership in this?\xc2\xa0 And is he reaching out to some of the conservative Democrats who have questions about whether this is an issue they want to take on?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, I think the President has been clear about where his position is.\xc2\xa0 Look, we are a big party and I don\'t doubt that there will be differing viewpoints, just as -- well, the Republican Party appears to have some differing viewpoints as well on a whole host of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, look, I think the President has laid out where he is.\xc2\xa0 Whether or not this gets solved in the next couple of weeks, during this session, whether it gets kicked over to the lame duck, I don\'t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 But I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s enough overlap in -- and as the President said, enough -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness to provide the very type of certainty that we hear many Republicans would like to provide, we can move forward on the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what the President believes we should do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then if I could just ask on the consumer protection agency -- there have been -- there\xe2\x80\x99s been talk about the possibility of appointing Elizabeth Warren as an interim head of the agency.\xc2\xa0 But there are senators on the Hill, including Senator Dodd, who have said that in doing so you would de-legitimize that post.\xc2\xa0 Does that do anything to change the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on whether or not that\'s a viable option?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look, I think the President spoke clearly, and has over the past several weeks, about how he views Elizabeth Warren.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this was -- the concept of a consumer office is something that she created.\xc2\xa0 I think obviously she is among the people that the President is looking at to implement the provisions of the legislation that Congress passed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any personnel announcements; the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any personnel announcements today, though they could come later this week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And making her an interim head is still an option that\'s on the table?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'m not going to get ahead of any announcements that the President may or may not make until he does.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also on Warren, with these reports that she might be an interim head or she might be made a counselor to the Treasury Secretary, are you worried that that would be seen as some kind of a half-measure, especially given that she\xe2\x80\x99s been endorsed by groups like the National Organization of Women?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to play hypothetical until there\xe2\x80\x99s a personnel announcement.\xc2\xa0 I think that, as I said a minute ago, as the President has said over the course of many weeks, I think she is -- based on the work that she has done over the course of her career, the fact that she -- again, this is an idea that was born largely by her -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s right to consider her for a role in implementing what the Congress has passed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just ask a couple of currencies question?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A what question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Currencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, let me save you the time and point you over to Treasury, so I do not --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you have no comment -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, if you want to borrow five bucks I could probably do that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But I will leave the yen and everything else to my good friends at the Department of Treasury.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christine O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, who won the Delaware senatorial primary last night for Republicans, in 2008 said that then-Senator Obama was so liberal that he was anti-American.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I just saw a couple of clips on that right before I came down.\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, that was probably an election -- she was, at that time, running for the same position she runs for now -- right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure if she was a candidate or a pundit.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think she -- or maybe both.\xc2\xa0 If I\'m not mistaken, she ran in 2008 against then-Senator Joe Biden and I think lost fairly handily, close to 2 to 1.\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, I think last night showed that there is a very vociferous debate going on inside the Republican Party for the hearts and minds of Republican voters.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at what people like Karl Rove or people like the state GOP chairman have said, the Republicans in Delaware nominated somebody that they don\'t believe can win -- I think in the words of the state party chair -- couldn\'t be elected dog catcher.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think comments like that is probably what led to her losing 2 to 1 in Delaware in 2008 and I think obviously is why you have people in the Republican Party structure in Delaware saying that she will be hard to elect because her views are outside the mainstream of what people in Delaware think now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House concerned at all that a lot of the voter anger that Republican incumbents have generally been feeling will now be directed at Democratic incumbents now that, other than Hawaii, the primaries are over and now it\xe2\x80\x99s general election time and a lot of this enthusiasm and a lot of this energy and a lot of this anger is going to be focused on the Democratic incumbents?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take this two ways.\xc2\xa0 One, I think you have to look at the practical implications of the anger that you just spoke about.\xc2\xa0 I think there is no doubt and I don\'t think anybody would disagree that that intraparty Republican anger has changed the complexion of a number of races at a state and a district level.\xc2\xa0 And that has real-world practical implications for the outcome of what happens in November.\xc2\xa0 Again, last night I think is a pretty good example both in a congressional race and in a Senate race in Delaware that makes winning those races for the Republicans a fundamentally harder task.</p>\n<p>I will say this, Jake, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking about the House race in Delaware also?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Delaware, yes.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this on a number of occasions, in all honesty, for about two years.\xc2\xa0 There is -- there was two years ago, not just because of the collapse of something like Lehman two years ago today, there was a frustration in the electorate about where we were economically.\xc2\xa0 That frustration I think in many ways is still in the electorate.<br/>\nIt was -- I spoke about this after Massachusetts.\xc2\xa0 I think that same type of frustration was there and I have no doubt that it continues today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what that produces in November.\xc2\xa0 I remain confident, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, that on Election Night we\xe2\x80\x99ll retain control of both the House and the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think anybody would tell you that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a frustration particularly based on what has happened economically and where we are in that recovery.\xc2\xa0 And the President shares in some of that frustration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, if I can try the currency question in a different way.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post reported I think last week that 41 White House aides owe the IRS over $800,000 in back taxes.\xc2\xa0 Is that correct?\xc2\xa0 Have you been able to check that out?\xc2\xa0 And are they being paid?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have the answer to that, but I can check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would we be able to get a list?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if that\'s a currency question, but -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was kind of a joke, but --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in all seriousness --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A lot of currency there.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me -- I don\'t know the answer, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just a second thing, on General Odierno. What kind of advice do you think the President is getting from him?\xc2\xa0 What was the purpose of bringing him in?\xc2\xa0 And with the war in Iraq still continuing -- even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not officially combat, we still have 50,000 U.S. troops there -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the war in Afghanistan, obviously.\xc2\xa0 A few weeks back there was a lot of speculation about Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99 future.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your sense right now, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s sense of how long he\xe2\x80\x99s staying? There\xe2\x80\x99s some ambiguity as to whether -- is he staying through the end of the year?\xc2\xa0 A lot of people are wondering because of continuity in both wars, obviously.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- let me take the second part.\xc2\xa0 I do not know -- I have not heard any update on that.\xc2\xa0 I would point you over to Geoff and Doug at the Pentagon for an answer on Secretary Gates.</p>\n<p>I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think somebody -- I think Secretary Gates has provided an enormous amount of leadership at a time, as you said, in which we were -- which we\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a war in Afghanistan and still involved in assisting in Iraq.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at the steps that he and the President have talked about taking as it relates to restructuring the Pentagon, those are tremendously important not just from a budgetary perspective, but for a readiness -- from the perspective of readiness.\xc2\xa0 The debates we had about the F-22 and the second engine for the F-35 obviously are very important.</p>\n<p>In terms of the first one, I don\'t have a readout of their meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know that Vice President Biden has spent time both in Iraq and in the United States recently with General Odierno and the General gave an update on government formation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, that\'s the biggest, more pressing outstanding question about where we are in Iraq.</p>\n<p>I know that the President and Vice President wanted to bring the General into the Oval Office and thank him for his service and his commitment to what he\xe2\x80\x99s done for our men and women in uniform and for our effort in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 I will try to get a more fulsome -- if there was -- the advice stuff.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas next week, either separately or on the fringes of the U.N. meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk about at the end of the U.N. meeting, though there was also -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard conflicting -- about whether each of those participants is going to be there for the whole time.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any scheduling update, but let me check on whether that\xe2\x80\x99s something that could happen at the end of next week.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule stay the same for the U.N.?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 As far -- I think we go up sometime Wednesday, late Wednesday afternoon, and we\xe2\x80\x99re there through Friday kind of early evening.\xc2\xa0 So I think -- and we will have, over the next couple days as the schedule sort of firms up, a list of -- and I think some of this will start coming out today -- a list of some of the bilateral meetings or multilateral meetings that the President will be involved in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if he does meet with them, does that suggest that the peace talks are actually making progress, as Secretary Clinton suggested?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think -- and look, Senator Mitchell, our Middle East envoy, briefed yesterday from Sharm el Sheikh.\xc2\xa0 The President continues to believe and I think the team continues to believe that we are in the midst of very serious direct talks, that both parties seem willing to engage in very frank discussions, and that we are slowly but surely making progress.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this is going to take some time.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to believe that each of the parties at this point continues to demonstrate a serious willingness to discuss the issues at hand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but a presidential meeting might suggest that they\xe2\x80\x99re at a point where it\xe2\x80\x99s going to take a push.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I will say this, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99d be at this point were it not for continued U.S. engagement and involvement in this process.</p>\n<p>Let me double-check the schedule and get a scheduling answer for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Regardless of where we are in that process, this President and the team will continue to become -- continue to remain very engaged in an effort to bring about peace.\xc2\xa0 When we\xe2\x80\x99re not involved in that engagement, when we\xe2\x80\x99re not, as you said, using our ability to push, we have tended not to have results that would lead you to think we\xe2\x80\x99re moving towards a comprehensive Middle East peace.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, the CNBC television network is hosting a town hall next Monday with President Obama, and an invitation has been extended to the Princeton Alumni Club of Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 Was the White House aware that they were being invited to attend the event and their questions pre-screened?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I honestly, Mike, don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to any of that, but I can have somebody check in on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have recently embarked -- or the White House and you personally have embarked on an effort to sort of vilify John Boehner.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not vilify.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think that John Boehner is a leader of an effort to take the House from Democratic control.\xc2\xa0 The effort that the President has been involved in, the effort that I and others have been involved in, is simply to illuminate the beliefs of John Boehner.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Many of them negative, in your opinion.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I am -- well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that comes as a large surprise to most people watching this --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question is that the Republicans in turn tried to do the same thing to Nancy Pelosi in 2006 and in 2008, were largely unsuccessful, evidently.\xc2\xa0 What makes you think that this effort will bear any more fruit than the GOP was able to?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will say, Mike, I think that having been involved in many of them from a campaign perspective, that elections are about choices.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is important for people to understand what those choices are and what -- and I think in John Boehner you have somebody who has been in Washington for a long time.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s instructive to illuminate that choice.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at -- look, The New York Times did a fairly large story on his special interest lobbyist connections, where he told the stories of handing out checks from the tobacco industry on the floor of the House of Representatives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think the debate that we are in the midst of on taxes is illuminating about a choice, and that is do you hold the middle class hostage to providing them permanent tax relief in order to borrow $700 billion that we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to give them -- to tax cuts to people that don\xe2\x80\x99t need them.\xc2\xa0 I think that is a -- I think that is part of what the President is going to take about that, part of what Democratic candidates all over the country are going to talk about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given all the issues surrounding the election in two months, do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to have a vote on something as momentous as this tax cut extension in a lame duck session?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, again, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get solved in the next few weeks, that\xe2\x80\x99s where you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to solve it before the tax cut expires.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, they could certainly stay in through the course of October.\xc2\xa0 I mean, they plan to split the first week in October.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a question I would direct towards --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should they stay to take care of it before the election?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What should happen is there ought to be a willingness from -- again, what John Boehner said on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday was -- appeared to be an agreement to move forward on the middle-class tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 That was the position the President talked about extensively the week before.\xc2\xa0 Now, I understand that those comments seemed to get the leader in a bit of hot water and he moved back to what appeared to be his original position, and that was the ransom for the middle class was $700 billion for tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>\n<p>Jonathan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President registered to vote in Washington, and did he vote yesterday, if he was?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I presume the President is registered in Illinois and I know participated earlier in the year in that and will vote from there in November.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be going to Connecticut on Thursday --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For Rahm?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s an election that would -- go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is going to Connecticut on Thursday to raise money for the attorney general.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us anything more about his plans for fundraising, for politics, and what he\xc2\xa0 -- how he aims to kind of try to reassemble the Obama vote of 2008?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jonathan, I think if you go back over the course of the past many weeks, the President has been involved, as leaders of the party are, in helping to raise money for the campaign committees, to raise money for candidates.\xc2\xa0 I think just recently we -- the President donated money, leftover money, out of the presidential account to the DNC, the DSCC, and the DCCC.\xc2\xa0 And, look, I think the President will continue those efforts throughout the election.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have with me or have not looked at a full schedule that takes us through Election Day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that schedule exist?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Somebody has it, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more.\xc2\xa0 David Plouffe told us a couple days ago that he is ready and willing to rejoin the political team in a more formal sense if asked.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be asked?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not the person that would make that decision.\xc2\xa0 I assume that would be a taller guy.</p>\n<p>Look, I think we are -- we all understand David\xe2\x80\x99s contributions from 2008.\xc2\xa0 We also talk fairly regularly to David, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the smartest guys in the country involved in politics.\xc2\xa0 And if the President -- I have no doubt that if the President asked him to take some sort of formal role that he\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to serve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, back on the tax cut debate.\xc2\xa0 Do you see any prospect at all for compromise on this, especially on the extension of the upper-bracket tax cut, perhaps a limited time or something like that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on this is quite clear. Because let\xe2\x80\x99s understand that the Republican position isn\xe2\x80\x99t really an extension for a limited period of time, okay?\xc2\xa0 They tried that sort of last week and then -- even in the enumeration by Leader Boehner of a two-year extension, I think the next sentence or half a breath away was \xe2\x80\x9cmaking this permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think there are -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness on Capitol Hill by the Republican Party to seek only a limited extension of the upper-income tax brackets.</p>\n<p>I think what the President has made abundantly clear is we can\xe2\x80\x99t -- we simply cannot afford to extend the tax cuts for those that make beyond $250,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just take for one second what that means.\xc2\xa0 Everybody will enjoy a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 Everybody enjoys a tax cut.\xc2\xa0 If you make less than $250,000, it\xe2\x80\x99s on all of your income.\xc2\xa0 If you make more than $250,000 a year, it is on your income up to $250,000 a year.\xc2\xa0 The President believes it\xe2\x80\x99s that latter part that borrowing $700 billion for is simply not affordable.</p>\n<p>Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a bit more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Connecticut tomorrow and why he decided to go there?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything immediately on that.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, again, as I said to Jonathan, a continuing effort to\xc2\xa0 -- obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s got events here, as I talked about at the beginning of this, but obviously continued event around these elections.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many requests is he getting to stump for candidates and lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve -- as I said to Jonathan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the full schedule, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first or the last time that you\xe2\x80\x99ll see the President out prior to the November elections.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what does the President expect to get out of the meetings at the U.N. General Assembly next weekend?\xc2\xa0 Is Iran going to be the major topic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think Iran will certainly be a big topic, obviously.\xc2\xa0 There are a series -- again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll announce these over the next day or so -- a series of bilateral meetings, some of which will and some of which probably won\xe2\x80\x99t touch on the topic of Iran.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that that is going to be some part of what is discussed.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is likely that the President -- when the President travels to New York next week, it will be as a President who has I think moved one important step closer to passing a ratified START treaty through the Senate to reduce nuclear weapons here and in Russia.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you give some guidance on the Cabinet meeting and the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement this afternoon?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the President will meet with his Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 The predominant item on the agenda will be the economy.\xc2\xa0 And then afterwards, instead of doing the statements sort of sitting down in the darker room, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to go outside.\xc2\xa0 The President will talk about the economy, specifically efforts underway in the Senate to move the small business package of tax cuts through, as well as the larger tax cut debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the President\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming book, you urge the press corps not to write about the First Family, particularly the President\xe2\x80\x99s daughters, to keep them out of the public spotlight. But they\xe2\x80\x99re central to this book project.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you see a contradiction in that.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think our encouragement is to keep their private lives private.\xc2\xa0 I think that if you read the book, it\xe2\x80\x99s, I think the President would tell you, an inspirational book about the country they live in and about their ability and the ability for children throughout this country to dream, as the President talked about yesterday, to dream big and accomplish whatever they want to.</p>\n<p>I think the President and the First Lady would be the first to underscore that you all have done a great job in keeping the lives of two individuals, quite frankly, that really weren\xe2\x80\x99t as involved in making a decision about running for office and moving to Washington -- allow them to live as normal a life -- a set of lives as they can.\xc2\xa0 And I will say, having known each of those two children for seven or so years, it is remarkable; I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great testament to the stability of what the First Lady has provided each of them in creating an environment of normalcy even amidst the White House.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if they\xe2\x80\x99ll be involved in marketing the book at all?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I do not believe they\xe2\x80\x99re -- they will not be involved in that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that the President will be heavily involved in that at all.</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you mentioned earlier the tax cuts, the $700 billion for the upper-income levels, being something we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford, and the President has said that many times.\xc2\xa0 But if we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the $700 billion over 10 years, how can we afford the more than $3 trillion, which is much more than that if you add in the interest on that debt?\xc2\xa0 Why is that affordable?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jackie, I think we all -- our viewpoint is that we are in the midst of great economic turmoil.\xc2\xa0 For the middle class, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- that didn\xe2\x80\x99t start two years ago today when the stock market dropped because of the collapse of a big bank.\xc2\xa0 It started years and years ago when their wages declined, when their jobs were moved overseas.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re at a period in which for a long time the middle class has gotten the short end of the deal.\xc2\xa0 We believe that this is not the time to change that equation on the middle class.</p>\n<p>I will say it was illuminating reading some of the stories today about the newfound excitedness of the deficit commission even from those who opposed it.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President has -- the President couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the Congress to authorize that, but set up himself a commission that will look at our immediate and long-term fiscal picture in order to make the decisions that have to be made and we know will be made to put ourselves back on a path toward fiscal responsibility.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The argument for keeping the so-called middle-class tax cuts is because of the economic weakness right now.\xc2\xa0 Why not make them temporary on the assumption that the economy will be much better, say, in two years or in three to five years?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s our great expectation that it will.\xc2\xa0 I think that for middle-class families, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been, as I said earlier, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting the short end of this deal for quite some time and I think providing them with a much needed break is important.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I go to Iran, and specifically the release of the hiker?\xc2\xa0 The bail that was posted -- I know the United States government in various forms has denied paying it.\xc2\xa0 And to the extent that we were involved with the discussion that led up to the release of Sarah Shourd, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the payment of that bail come close to being a payment of ransom for someone that we believe is innocent?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the U.S. government does not post bail for detained citizens and did not do so in this case.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Department of State for any additional detail that they may provide.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there are a number of countries that have been helpful in our efforts in communicating with and concerning the release yesterday.\xc2\xa0 We are happy that Sarah is back with her family.</p>\n<p>My message to the Iranian government, though, would be the same the President had yesterday, and that is, there are still two remaining hikers that have committed no crime in custody and detained in Iran.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no reason that those two shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be immediately released by the Iranian government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, the United States government had no role in the payment of the bail?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 They did -- does not post bail for detained --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was not posed in discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- does not post bail for detained citizens and did not do so in this case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is not -- is not involved in discussions that led that --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, as I said, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to State if there are additional details that they want to provide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, a lot of people are using and misusing religion in the name of religion, a lot of things are going on.\xc2\xa0 You think time has come now for the President to use opportunity at the United Nations another message for -- in the name of religion so that with the confusion and all the misunderstanding going on around the world?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think that the President has -- will have weeks before the U.N., particularly last week where we saw what was potentially transpiring in Florida and what we know did transpire throughout the world in relation to the threat of that activity.\xc2\xa0 So I think the President, in all honesty, has been -- has taken the occasion, on more than one occasion recently, to speak directly to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as immigration is concerned, it\xe2\x80\x99s not only question of legal immigrants, but also it\xe2\x80\x99s affecting small businesses because they cannot hire by and large and they are hurting.\xc2\xa0 But Senator Harry Reid has a new idea to make illegals legal.\xc2\xa0 Is President aware of that, that they should go to school or to go to military, or what is --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, Goyal, what you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to is the DREAM Act, which affects the children of parents that are in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The President was a supporter of the DREAM Act as a senator.\xc2\xa0 The administration is supportive of that legislation.\xc2\xa0 The previous administration was supportive of that legislation.\xc2\xa0 And certainly it\xe2\x80\x99s our hope that working with Congress we can see progress on that.\xc2\xa0 And none of that will replace what has to happen from a comprehensive level and a comprehensive perspective to deal with the issues around immigration reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The DREAM Act may be included, as you know, as part of the defense authorization bill.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Senator Reid has said, right.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right -- as well as \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal.\xc2\xa0 Will the President -- does he still plan on potentially vetoing that defense authorization bill if it includes money for the alternative engine?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know of no position change on our veto threat around that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So even if it includes \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d repeal and the --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me see if I can get further guidance, but I think an earlier statement said that.\xc2\xa0 And as I mentioned earlier, the President is enormously -- has spent an enormous amount of time, as Secretary Gates has, on the tasks at hand in reshaping the way the Pentagon spends money, contracting a whole host of issues that go directly to the resources that come from our government and go through and to the Pentagon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no change on that position?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know of no change on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the President concerned about the diminishing number of moderate Republicans in the Senate?\xc2\xa0 And does he think he can work with some of these Tea Party senators if they win?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what remains to be seen is whether or not these are candidates that are going to win.\xc2\xa0 I mean, again, I think their nomination in and of itself has changed, as I said earlier, the complexion of many of these races.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a process I think that\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That did not happen -- that did not start this summer.\xc2\xa0 That did not start a month ago.\xc2\xa0 Go back to I think some of the races that you saw in -- go to the special elections that you saw in New York last year.\xc2\xa0 This happened in those places as well.\xc2\xa0 We saw it continue in New York last night in the gubernatorial race.</p>\n<p>Look, the President, regardless of who that makeup is, will seek to work with anybody in Congress, in the Senate or the House, that is serious about moving the country forward and addressing the problems that we have, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s our medium- and long-term fiscal situation, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the economic recovery, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s education, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s immigration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I will say that working with somebody on Capitol Hill is a\xc2\xa0 -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a two-way street.\xc2\xa0 This President came here wanting and hoping to do that.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Senator McConnell and others say they had a conscious strategy from the very beginning not to do that.\xc2\xa0 They didn\xe2\x80\x99t propose alternatives; they just said no.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s led to the Senate now proposing and considering legislation to cut taxes on small business that most Republicans are going to vote against.\xc2\xa0 And if two years ago you would have said, I envision ending capital gains on investments in small business, do you think Mitch McConnell would support that?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99d say yes before I finished my hypothetical question.\xc2\xa0 Yet you\xe2\x80\x99ve\xc2\xa0 -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve worked themselves into a corner of saying, no, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do this, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that -- no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you get.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President find offensive any of the themes of the Tea Party movement?\xc2\xa0 For example, some people suggest there are racist undercurrents.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that -- I think as the President said -- obviously I think in the Tea Party there is a strain of frustration with where this country is and where we are economically.\xc2\xa0 The President understands that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I think there are some pretty outlandish things that people have said in the past week that aren\xe2\x80\x99t reserved for just Tea Party candidates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, just one quick thing.\xc2\xa0 The President has added something in the Rose Garden to his schedule today at 4:30 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Can you give a general topic?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be on small business legislation and tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no personnel announcements.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 May I follow up on that, please?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Which part?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The second part of your answer.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m kidding.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, the second part of your answer right now.\xc2\xa0 You moved this to the Rose Garden, and you did say you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take up the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and you certainly seem emboldened after the Boehner statement.\xc2\xa0 Would you rule out -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t this be a perfect storm for the President to call on Congress to move forwards and put a middle-class tax cut on the floor?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President did that last week.\xc2\xa0 Again, I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was before Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s statement that he did appear to jump on as soon as he said it.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Because I think -- again, this was Saturday and Sunday John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about Sunday evening, Monday- Tuesday John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 But there was -- there appeared to be a willingness to accept the President\xe2\x80\x99s position that those in the middle class shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held hostage to tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want to get that out before they leave?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness by Republicans to do that, sure.\xc2\xa0 But again, that was Saturday, early Sunday John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 Then there was sort of Sunday evening, Monday-Tuesday John Boehner that seemed very quickly to go back to last week\xe2\x80\x99s John Boehner.\xc2\xa0 So this may be a better question for the willingness of leader Boehner to not hold the middle class hostage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ellen Tauscher said in the run-up to the vote on the New START treaty there\xe2\x80\x99s been an aggressive effort led by the President to talk to Senate Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Who has the President called?\xc2\xa0 And has he been in close contact with the Russian President?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the last time he talked with Medvedev.\xc2\xa0 Let me find a call list of those that -- I know that the President, the Vice President and the security team have all been involved in discussions over the past many weeks since the treaty went up.\xc2\xa0 And so let me try to find the list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there specific members that they\'re targeting?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think there are members -- senators that have, through their statements, discussed a willingness to be supportive of a reduction in strategic nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 I saw I think a clip yesterday from Senator Corker mentioning specifically that he thought that efforts over the past sort of four to six weeks had strengthened the treaty.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the President has a very good relationship with both the chairman, John Kerry, and the ranking member, Senator Lugar -- good relationships with both, and I know has, as well as the Vice President, been in contact.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a more specific list.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, speaking of phone calls, has the President made any calls to the winners or losers in the primary elections?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He I think made some calls last night.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the extent of it.\xc2\xa0 I can try to see --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us who?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I will try to get a longer list.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent was the friendship between President Obama and Adrian Fenty?\xc2\xa0 Was it a political friendship, or was it a genuine friendship that encompassed politics?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the President more specifically. I <br/>\nthink the President believes -- I believe there was both a personal and a political relationship obviously that each of those shared.\xc2\xa0 And I know that at some point he\xe2\x80\x99ll get an opportunity, if he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t already, to call Mayor Fenty and wish him well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, on New York, Charlie Rangel -- he\xe2\x80\x99s won the primary going into November.\xc2\xa0 But is Charlie Rangel\xe2\x80\x99s win an albatross around the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 neck for November?\xc2\xa0 Some have\xc2\xa0 said that, to include members of the GOP.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on or anything new to say on that race.\xc2\xa0 I think the President has talked about that in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Margaret.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I realize that in the case of Delaware, last night\xe2\x80\x99s win may actually have made it harder for the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the Republicans seem to think.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does it send a turnout warning?\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you -- if the White House was trying to figure out how to advise maybe Democrats in California or in Connecticut, are there some ominous signals or lessons for Democrats to take away from last night\xe2\x80\x99s election results?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How so?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, if nothing else, there\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a very motivated portion of what\xe2\x80\x99s become Republican voters.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen in surveys for many months that base Republican voters are very energized.\xc2\xa0 I think if you look at a place like Delaware -- you had two very different visions.\xc2\xa0 These were not -- I look back at our race in 2008.\xc2\xa0 Save probably a couple of very -- save a couple of issues, you had pretty broad agreement between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on a number of things.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you could say the same -- certainly from the comments that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen today, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Mike Castle and Christine O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell seem to share the same viewpoint on a number of topics. I think the question for them is going to be where do the voters that end up on the other side of the outcome of these exceedingly divisive races that change the complexion of the map, where do those voters that weren\xe2\x80\x99t on the winning side go?</p>\n<p>I think if -- that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly going to remain to be seen, because I think, by all accounts, again, there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant ideological difference between those two camps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to kind of the \xe2\x80\x9cthrow the bums out\xe2\x80\x9d message, do you think that that\xe2\x80\x99s being more driven by the economy, or do you think that President Obama himself deserves some responsibility for it?\xc2\xa0 After all, I mean, that was his rallying cry a couple of years ago.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there has been an antiestablishment frustration in the electorate for a lot longer than we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Washington.\xc2\xa0 There was a -- again, two years ago today, Lehman collapsed.\xc2\xa0 There was a pretty -- both then and in the days after -- a pretty strong view on that, and quite frankly, there was before.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Look, I think last night was -- last night demonstrated, in as clear as I think any way, that you will take away a lot of things from this election.\xc2\xa0 But I think the notion that -- I mean, look, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t play a role in last night\xe2\x80\x99s Delaware election.\xc2\xa0 That was, as I said, a very pointed intra-party squabble.\xc2\xa0 And I think there are clearly -- as a result of what happened in 2008, there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that a party goes through after you lose an election like that.\xc2\xa0 It is playing out.\xc2\xa0 It is narrowing their map.\xc2\xa0 And I think it is providing the candidates that we have with -- and I think the American people -- with some stark choices.</p>\n<p>You have candidates that have questioned the decision to set up something like Social Security, to end Medicare, to -- I mean, those are -- to do away with a Department of Education.\xc2\xa0 I think those are going to be interesting choices for some of those -- particularly for moderate voters.\xc2\xa0 And, obviously -- there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a whole section of the electorate that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going -- isn\xe2\x80\x99t or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t participate in an active primary or caucus process that will be part of a November election.</p>\n<p>David.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Robert.\xc2\xa0 On Afghanistan, last week, The Washington Post reported that the White House or the administration had asked John Kerry and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee not to release a report it had completed on corruption in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the answer, but I can check.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And do you believe, though, that the American public deserves sort of full transparency on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening politically in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 In what way?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in terms of reports like this?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 David, like I said, let me check on the report.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, so but you can and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get an answer on that?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I can check on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up -- thank you.\xc2\xa0 Les, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, all right.\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Iran, is there any mechanism to prevent Ahmadinejad from speaking to the U.N. unless he brings the two hostages out? And are there any negotiations to try to arrange a deal with him to come here with those two hostages?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d point you to the Department of State on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 None that I know of.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about preventing him from speaking at the United Nations --</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve not heard anything.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you look into that, please?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99d point you the Department of State.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, two questions.\xc2\xa0 In Virginia, Teresa Lewis is scheduled to be executed in eight days as an accessory to murders committed by two male accomplices, both of whom were sentenced to life by the same judge who sentenced her to death.\xc2\xa0 And my question:\xc2\xa0 Will the President extend clemency rather than allowing this monumental injustice?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was public.\xc2\xa0 It was all over The Washington Post.\xc2\xa0 <br/>\nYou do read that paper?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a subscriber.\xc2\xa0 Can I finish my answer before you protest and gesticulate?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly -- excuse me.\xc2\xa0 Please forgive me.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know that\'s a high bar for me to ask, but what the heck, right?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not legally familiar with the details of the case.\xc2\xa0 I assume that she is not sentenced under federal law but is sentenced under Virginia law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, a Virginia judge.</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Right -- through state law.\xc2\xa0 And I think that is a clemency process that goes through the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but the governor is not liable to -- he is not liable to do it.\xc2\xa0 Will the President extend mercy to this woman?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think this is a process that the Virginia legal process will have to play out.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you give us just a rough estimate -- of more than -- the more than 200 Democrats running for reelection to Congress, how many have invited the President to speak in their districts this and next month before November 2nd?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, I\'m sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 The German Marshall Fund of the United States today released a poll saying that 78 percent of Europeans approve of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policies.\xc2\xa0 Any comments on that?\xc2\xa0 And do you think the President would ever have a chance to get those numbers here in the States?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good question.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that what the President has set out to do from the very beginning was to improve our relations with the rest of the world after I think what could easily be said was a rocky period in our bilateral and multilateral relationships around the world.\xc2\xa0 And I think the priorities that he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on are the priorities that -- certainly that the American people have, but also that citizens of the world have.\xc2\xa0 That is to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of those that would do those in Europe and those in America harm; to be actively engaged and involved in a Middle East peace process that will result in a long-term lasting peace and a two-state solution; and to, probably most importantly, deal with al Qaeda and its extremist allies in places like Southeast Asia and throughout the world in order to make this country and the world a safer place to be.</p>\n<p>I will say that -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded as we go through this process of ratifying a START treaty -- again, the committee vote will be tomorrow -- that on so many of these efforts in the past, you have seen these reductions in strategic nuclear treaties pass with vote totals that were in the 90s -- because we\xe2\x80\x99re reminded that the progress that we need to make on reducing that threat has been one that was supported by Presidents like Barack Obama and Presidents like Ronald Reagan; that by foreign policy has traditionally enjoyed a very bipartisan tenor and a bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And certainly our hope is that as the Senate goes about processing the treaty in the committee and then ultimately on the floor, that that type of bipartisanship will be engendered in meeting the goals of making our planet a safer place to be for everyone.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have the numbers of the people who he\xe2\x80\x99s called\xc2\xa0 -- is that what you got from Bill?</p>\n<p>MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, Bill gave me another -- if I had your answer, April, I would have given it to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n12:42 P.M.
