EDT</div> <div class="legacy-para"><br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 What\'s going on, guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good morning.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\'t expect to you see until the second leg.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was told by popular demand I should come back on the front leg.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you tell us a little bit about today?\xc2\xa0 Was the President invited to go to this memorial?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We were invited by CBS to speak at Mr. Cronkite\'s memorial service, and the President, understanding the role that Mr. Cronkite played in our country and in journalism, was happy to accept.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching to a foreign policy question, Iran is scheduled to turn in a package of proposals today to world powers on its nuclear program and other challenges.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comments or thoughts about that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not on the front end.\xc2\xa0 Let me see when that happens and what response we\'ll have for you guys on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything specific that you would like to say that you need to see from Iran in that proposal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think Iran has to live up to its responsibilities and end its illicit nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not just the opinion of one country; that\'s the opinion of the world. I think -- let\'s hope we see progress on them doing that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is tonight\'s speech finished?\xc2\xa0 Is he still working on it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\'s still working on it.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the process there?\xc2\xa0 Is it bouncing off ideas off other aides?\xc2\xa0 Who is kind of involved in the drafting?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- a dart board and -- no, he came back from Camp David Monday with many handwritten pages of notes that he gave to the speechwriters.\xc2\xa0 He got another draft incorporating more edits last night, and worked on it with the speechwriters before he left this morning.\xc2\xa0 So my sense is he\'ll be tinkering with this some this afternoon, but my sense is this thing will be locked sometime this afternoon.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it still about 35 minutes, half an hour?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I need to check on that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate a embargoed copy at a certain time or --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s certainly our hope, yes.\xc2\xa0 I think we will be able to get you guys something obviously before the speech starts.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is the White House watching the OPEC meeting today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure somebody is.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I have to admit I haven\'t -- I\'ve been worried about health care today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything that we didn\'t know yesterday that you can tell us about -- (laughter) -- about tonight\'s speech?\xc2\xa0 Has anything changed substantively overnight?\xc2\xa0 And do you have any update for us once the speech is done on vote schedules, now that Baucus is going to have something out?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me -- look, in terms of vote schedules, obviously, I mean, the President continues to talk with Democrats and Republicans; talked with Senator Baucus yesterday and hopes that the Finance Committee can get something done in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 I think Senator Baucus has been working with this group of senators for almost a year on getting something out of the committee.\xc2\xa0 Not long after the election, the committee put out its policy white paper on health care reform last November.\xc2\xa0 So obviously we\'re hopeful that something can get done in that committee.\xc2\xa0 That would obviously be an important milestone in this reform.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President, I think, has a few main goals tonight:\xc2\xa0 to speak clearly to the American people about what\'s in health care reform; for those that are fortunate to have insurance, to demonstrate for them that his plan will bring them security and stability; and for those that don\'t have health insurance, that we\'ll provide an affordable way for them to get accessible insurance.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he use the word, "trigger," and does he think that that\'s a good compromise?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President will talk tonight about the public option and about the necessity for choice and competition, but I don\'t want to make all his news now.\xc2\xa0 Then what will we do later tonight?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do it all over again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But he\'s looking forward to it and I think it\'s a good opportunity to once again talk directly to the American people about how important health care reform is and why we have to get it done this year.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anyone interesting flying back with you or flying out with you today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Marvin Nicholson is here --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- Reggie Love -- no, no -- Ben Finkenbinder is here.\xc2\xa0 No, this is a -- it\'s kind of a scaled-down crew today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a scaled-down group.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about Friday and the 9/11 anniversary.\xc2\xa0 You said yesterday that the President was going to have meetings at the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 Is that the sum total of what the administration is going to do to mark the anniversary?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 He will -- as we said several days ago in the morning gaggle in my office, that he\'ll go to the Pentagon, visit with families of loved ones that were lost there, visit the memorial, and speak about what the day means and the sacrifices of thousands, not just at the Pentagon, but in Pennsylvania and certainly and most obviously in New York.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, I have one last follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday I asked about the President\'s reaction to the WTO ruling on Airbus and Boeing.\xc2\xa0 Have you had a chance to get the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I thought somebody got back to you on that, but let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I thought Ben LaBolt did, but I will -- or he had some stuff on that, so let me check on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you tell us on the way back in case anything happens between now and then?<br/> <br/>  MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will be happy to.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 <br/>  9:08 A.M.
