Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>2:14 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 You all just had an opportunity to hear from the President about his reaction to the speech from Prime Minister Netanyahu this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m here to take your questions on that or any other topics that are on your mind today.</p>\n<p>Nedra, would you like to get us started?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Did anyone here at the White House authorize or raise any objections to Secretary Clinton using her personal email account while at the State Department?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, what I can tell you is that very specific guidance has been given to agencies all across the government, which is specifically that employees of the Obama administration should use their official email accounts when they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting official government business.\xc2\xa0 However, when there are situations where personal email accounts are used, it is important for those records to be preserved consistent with the Federal Records Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In fact, the President signed into law a bill at the end of last year clarifying the guidelines for how those personal emails can be properly stored and maintained.\xc2\xa0 This is part of why the State Department has asked all of the previous Secretaries of State who have used any email as they were conducting official U.S. business to send their emails to the State Department so they could be properly preserved and maintained.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team, in response to that request, reviewed her emails and complied with that request by sending all of the emails on her personal account that pertained to her official responsibilities as Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 They did that even though many of the records were already maintained on the State\xe2\x80\x99s system because those records were emails between the Secretary of State and State Department employees using their official government email address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So are you saying that her use of her personal email, solely, was appropriate, or was it in violation of this policy?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what you should do is that you should check with the State Department who is responsible for administering this policy.\xc2\xa0 But the policy, as a general matter, allows individuals to use their personal email address as long as those emails are maintained and sent to the State Department -- which, if you ask Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they completed in the last month or two.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given that\xe2\x80\x99s she not the first person to use personal emails, does there need to be some sort of system for archiving personal emails of high-ranking government officials like this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is part of this law that I referred to that the President signed into law at the end of last year -- that is does establish clear guidelines for how individuals, if they are using their personal email to conduct official business, can ensure that those records are properly maintained.</p>\n<p>Now, the official guidance that we offer to administration employees -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the guidance that I have followed here personally when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the White House -- is that I use my official government email address when I\xe2\x80\x99m conducting official government business.\xc2\xa0 It saves me the additional step of having to take a personal email and forward it to my government email so that it can be properly maintained.</p>\n<p>Now, it\xe2\x80\x99s not incredibly uncommon for one of you, or one of your colleagues, to send an email to my personal address.\xc2\xa0 A few of you have it.\xc2\xa0 But when I do that, I will answer the emails -- which I try to be pretty good about doing -- but then I will take that response and forward the email to my official account so that the record of that email exchange can be properly preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to the announcement from the House that they will vote on a Homeland Security funding bill without restrictions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Nedra, as you heard me say yesterday, the White House has been urging the Congress for months now to do the right thing, and that is pass a full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that does not include any politically motivated riders.\xc2\xa0 And the benefit of that is, is that it will allow the Department of Homeland Security to plan and take the necessary steps to protect the American people.\xc2\xa0 And at the end of last year, Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill got together and worked to hammer out an agreement about the appropriate funding levels for that agency.</p>\n<p>That agreement was reached at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 But for several months now, congressional Republicans have prevented votes on that compromise because they were trying to figure out a way that they could capitalize on a political opportunity.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, trying to politicize something as fundamental to our national security as funding for the Department of Homeland Security is completely inappropriate.\xc2\xa0 And we are pleased that congressional leaders in the House have apparently relented, they\xe2\x80\x99ve abandoned the search for political advantage, and are instead just trying to move forward to do the right thing, which is to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n<p>Roberta.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When Secretary Clinton was using her private email address to do her work as Secretary, was the White House Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Office aware of that?\xc2\xa0 And did it sanction that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the responsibility for ensuring that agency records are properly preserved and maintained is the responsibility of agency officials in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration.\xc2\xa0 This is a fairly bureaucratic function, but yet an important one.\xc2\xa0 These records need to be maintained for a variety of reasons.\xc2\xa0 One is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine that historians in the future will want to review these records to conduct their academic analysis about things that occurred in the administration.\xc2\xa0 The records also need to be preserved and maintained so that legitimate requests, either from private citizens or from Congress, to review that information can be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the agencies to maintain their own records management plan, if you will, but they certainly do that in close coordination with the experts at NARA, at the National Archives and Records Administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So White House officials that she may have been emailing with, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise this at any point in time as you might want to use your official government -- or why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you using your officials account?\xc2\xa0 Was it just okay with everybody?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I pointed out, Roberta, in response to Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s question, it is the responsibility of agencies to preserve those records, even when those records exist on a personal email account.\xc2\xa0 That is why, in order to make it easier for everybody and to avoid circumstances where an individual may forget to forward an email, we encourage people to use their official government email account when they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting official government business.\xc2\xa0 However, when a personal email account is involved, the law suggests -- or the law mandates, in fact, that that record be properly preserved, and that can be done by forwarding it to an official government email where it can be preserved on the system.</p>\n<p>Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team did, was they reviewed her personal emails to capture all of those that pertained to the conduct of official U.S. business and sent them to the State Department so they could be properly maintained.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, I understand that hundreds of those records have actually already been provided to Congress in response to a legitimate congressional oversight request.</p>\n<p>So that, I think, reflects a commitment on the part of the State Department to not just following the Federal Records Act, but also coordinating and complying with legitimate requests from congressional oversight committees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there security concerns, though, with a high-ranking official like the Secretary of State using a personal email address for official business?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, for the specific protocols that are in place at the State Department, you should check with the experts at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 These are their rules for them to manage.\xc2\xa0 The President, what he insists that all the agencies do is live up to the obligations that they have under the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, how do you feel about those rules?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that rule then allow a big space for emails to not be preserved if the use of a personal email on a regular basis is even allowed and thought to be okay long term?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Michelle, the guidance that we have certainly given to everybody who works here at the White House -- and I think this is consistent with the guidance that federal employees at agencies across the government have received -- is that they should use their official email account when they\xe2\x80\x99re conducting official government business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On those instances in which official business is conducted on personal email accounts, it\'s important for those records, those personal emails, to be forwarded to the agency so that they can be properly maintained.\xc2\xa0 In most cases, at least here at the White House, it\'s as simple as just forwarding it to your official government account so that those emails can be properly maintained and preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a personal responsibility.\xc2\xa0 And do you think that the rules need to be tightened up since it seems to leave a big gap there in who\xe2\x80\x99s going to forward that email and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to make sure that that email is forwarded?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the law is pretty clear about what\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to comply, which is that it\'s important to ensure that those emails that may exist on one\xe2\x80\x99s personal email account are properly maintained.\xc2\xa0 And again, that is why we saw the State Department take the step of asking all of the former Secretaries of State who have used email as they\xe2\x80\x99ve done their work to review their personal email in search of records that relate to the conduct of official U.S. business.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team complied with that request by reviewing her personal email, pulling together all of the ones that were related to her official work as a Secretary of State, and forward it to the State Department so that they could preserve and maintain those records and, in fact, use them to respond to legitimate requests from Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And the speech we just heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu, his whole premise of hating this potential deal was that Iran is such a threat, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be trusted really under any means.\xc2\xa0 Do you think that he overstated that threat on the basis that a deal is being worked out?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that he did betray the trust between allies, as you put it, because he discussed some key points of that potential deal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Michelle, let me take the first part first, which is I think Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor, had a rather cogent way of summarizing our approach to this deal:\xc2\xa0 Distrust and verify.\xc2\xa0 As she laid out, and even as the President relayed in his comments in the Oval Office, there are a variety of reasons to not trust the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 There are numerous examples of the Iranians not being honest with the international community about their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of examples of that.\xc2\xa0 One, and in some ways, the best example of that is the nuclear facility at Fordow that the United States and our allies revealed early on in the President\xe2\x80\x99s tenure in office, back in 2009.</p>\n<p>So that is why, as the President mentioned in the Oval Office, any sort of deal that the United States signs on to will include historically significant verification measures.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about detailed verification measures that would include, of course, as you would expect, the routine inspection of nuclear facilities in Iran, but it would also expand to things like regular inspections of uranium mines that exist in Iran, regular inspection of manufacturing facilities that are related to nuclear equipment that are critical to the functioning of their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We\'re talking about an in-depth, rigorous inspections regime that can verify for the international community that Iran is living up to their end of the deal.</p>\n<p>Now, the second part of your question was related to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This idea that he was talking about, these points of a potential deal.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should he not have done that?\xc2\xa0 Was that a betrayal of trust?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the Israeli Prime Minister is allowed to make the decisions, as I referred to yesterday -- is allowed to make the decisions about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say based on his own assessment about the best interests of Israeli national security.\xc2\xa0 That\'s his responsibility as the politically democratically elected leader of Israel.</p>\n<p>But the President has made clear that there are other concerns in mind, principally ensuring that the relationship between the United States and Israel isn\'t subjected to the turbulence of partisan politics.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has chosen a somewhat different approach.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why the President is not meeting with the Prime Minister on this visit to the United States.\xc2\xa0 But it does not reflect any change in this administration\xe2\x80\x99s or this country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s national security.</p>\n<p>Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the emails.\xc2\xa0 The President is a noted emailer-in-chief.\xc2\xa0 Has he ever emailed with former Secretary of State Clinton?\xc2\xa0 Did they email when she was in office?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Zeke, you won\'t be surprised to hear that I\'m not going to talk in a lot of detail about emails that are sent to or from the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 But I will tell you as a general matter, two things.\xc2\xa0 The first is that the President\xe2\x80\x99s emails are subject to the Presidential Records Act, which does have -- which is a little bit different than the Federal Records Act.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, you guys aren\'t going to quiz me on that.\xc2\xa0 But they are subjected to the Presidential Records Act that does require those records to be preserved and maintained.\xc2\xa0 They have obvious scholarly value in the future.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second point that I\'ll make about that is that if Secretary Clinton did email the President of the United States, that under that protocol, those records would have been preserved.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I think that sort of highlights the situation that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team encountered, which is that a large number of the records that they reviewed in response to the State Department request were records that already existed on the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s system because they were emails between her and State Department employees with StateDepartment.gov email addresses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, when somebody in the White House, in the West Wing, had an email to send to the Secretary of State, did they just use her private email account?\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a State Department email account.\xc2\xa0 How did they get in contact with her?\xc2\xa0 Did that never raise a flag inside the West Wing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Zeke, what I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you is that during her four years as Secretary of State, she and I did not trade emails, so I do not know what her email address is.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that if there were emails between Secretary Clinton and White House officials, and I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that there were some emails, those emails weren\xe2\x80\x99t just protected by -- or maintained by the White House email system; those emails were reviewed by Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team, and they were sent to the State Department so they could properly maintained on their system as well.\xc2\xa0 And, again, that is consistent with the requirements of the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The domain that the Secretary used apparently to send these emails was registered just a week before the President took office.\xc2\xa0 The same day her confirmation hearings in the Senate began, it seemed that this was setup for the express purpose of being the vehicle for her to use email while she was serving as Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 For the President who has openly said multiple times, most-transparent administration in history, was this a conversation that they had before she took office?\xc2\xa0 Was this something that anyone in this White House ever flagged for her?\xc2\xa0 And is this consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s promise to make this a transparent administration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Zeke, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of all the mechanics that went into setting up the email system that you have just described.\xc2\xa0 I would encourage you to check with Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team or somebody over at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But, again, what the President has insisted on from the beginning of his administration, as you alluded to, is a commitment to, among other things, making sure that emailed communication, to the extent that they are official government records, are properly preserved and maintained, both so that in the future they can be reviewed by historians, but also so that they can be used when necessary to respond to legitimate requests from Congress or the public to review those records.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one last one.\xc2\xa0 You said that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s staff reviewed and turned over 55,000 pages of emails.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not 55,000 emails.\xc2\xa0 And why should the American people take her word or her staff\xe2\x80\x99s word for it?\xc2\xa0 Why is there no independent review?\xc2\xa0 By going through this process, she set it up that it\xe2\x80\x99s on her word or on her staff\xe2\x80\x99s word that these are the only emails pertaining to her official business at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Why should anybody take that at face value?\xc2\xa0 Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be some system in place to have an independent arbiter of that information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Zeke, in terms of the number -- the 55,000 number is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen reported.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t verified that number, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve been careful to avoid using it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that refers to pages or emails or what.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not disputing the number; I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the number is.\xc2\xa0 I know that there were a large number of records that numbered in the thousands that were turned over by Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team at the request of the State Department.\xc2\xa0 Again, this was a request the State Department had made to previous Secretaries of State, all previous Secretaries of State in both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, again, in the same way that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team reviewed her personal email to make sure that they were forwarding on to the State Department emails that relate to her conduct of official U.S. business, the same is true of those Secretaries of State who served in a Republican administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And, ultimately, that is what the law requires -- is that if an individual used a personal email account for official U.S. business, that that information, that record should be sent and maintained in the system that\xe2\x80\x99s been setup by that specific agency.\xc2\xa0 And that is why, frankly, we encourage people -- a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t have a team like Secretary Clinton does -- that\xe2\x80\x99s why we encourage them to not rely on remembering to forward a personal email to your government system, but to actually just use the official government system that\xe2\x80\x99s set up so you can ensure that those records are properly maintained and preserved.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There have been a lot of descriptions today of what Secretary Clinton may or may not have done -- violated the law, skirted the law, complied.\xc2\xa0 Where do you come down?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I come down wherever the State Department attorney comes down.\xc2\xa0 Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the State Department to ensure compliance with these rules.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration, though.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Of course it is.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what sort of guidance these agencies should be following.\xc2\xa0 But each of them, I think understandably, implements these guidelines in their own way that reflect the unique challenges and responsibilities of that agency\xe2\x80\x99s employees.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility at the agency level for compliance to be determined.\xc2\xa0 They do that in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s their policy to implement and their policy to evaluate whether or not or how individuals should comply with those guidelines.\xc2\xa0 And, again, this is what prompted the request from the State Department to previously-serving Secretaries of State to forward onto them records that may have been kept in their personal email account.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be cute here, but lots of people work for this administration, this is an ongoing topic of conversation, I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a new law, but can you venture a conclusion or will you offer a conclusion as to whether or not the Secretary broke the law, skirted the law, or complied with the law, based on what we know so far?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Major, the guidelines that are laid out under the Federal Records Act require that records that are maintained -- that pertain to official government business, that do reside in one\xe2\x80\x99s personal email account, should be turned over to agency officials so that those records can be properly maintained and preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you make a judgment as to whether or not you believe the Secretary has complied with that guidance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I know that Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has indicated that they complied with that guidance.\xc2\xa0 I know that the Secretary of -- or the Department of State has made the request and has received what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team put together.\xc2\xa0 But, ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of those two parties to assess how and whether this is within the guidelines of what is required.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has said is that they reviewed the emails, and they took the emails that were related to her official work as the Secretary of State and sent them to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the public\xe2\x80\x99s benefit and in the name of transparency, will you call on the State Department to release these emails publicly?\xc2\xa0 The non-classified ones?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Major, I know that there are a number of these emails that have already -- well, first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that any of them are classified.\xc2\xa0 But I know that a number of these emails have already been produced to Congress as it relates to congressional -- legitimate congressional oversight request.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what the rules are under the Freedom of Information Act for the State Department.\xc2\xa0 But certainly if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested in seeing those emails, that would be the avenue that I would recommend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 Did the Prime Minister say anything in his characterization of what Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior has been, or is likely to be, that the administration disagrees with?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it depends.\xc2\xa0 What Prime Minister Netanyahu did detail at some length are the reasons that the international community does distrust promises that are made by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s leaders.\xc2\xa0 There is no doubt that Iran has done things, like routinely supported and continues to support terrorism around the globe, most of it in the region, but also around the globe.</p>\n<p>There is no arguing, as the President pointed out, with the fact that Iran has menaced our closest ally in the region, repeatedly, including using some vile anti-Semitic language.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also no question, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Prime Minister Netanyahu raised this, but there are also some American citizens who are currently being unjustly held in Iran.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the list of concerns that we have with Iran is lengthy, and several of the items at the top of that list are significant.\xc2\xa0 But what we know is that it is important for Iran not to obtain a nuclear weapon, because obtaining a nuclear weapon would only strengthen their hand as they try to do the other bad things that they do.\xc2\xa0 That if Iran has a nuclear weapon and they\xe2\x80\x99re supporting terrorism, it makes their support for terror groups even more dangerous.\xc2\xa0 If Iran has a nuclear weapon and they are menacing Israel, that makes those threats even more dangerous.</p>\n<p>And the fact is, if Iran obtains a nuclear weapon and they unjustly detain American citizens in their country, it makes it harder to get those citizens back.\xc2\xa0 So that is why the President has made as his priority resolving the broader international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the strategy that the President has laid out is one that we can count on to best resolve our concerns with their program.\xc2\xa0 If we can put in place very tough monitoring requirements and extend the breakout time to one year, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best way, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best possible way to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The alternative that was advocated by Prime Minister Netanyahu and others falls far short of that.\xc2\xa0 Military action we know would fall far short of that.\xc2\xa0 Additional sanctions that would cause our international coalition to crumble would fall far short of that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The strategy that the President has laid out is the one that has the best likelihood of success and is the one that can best resolve the concerns of the international community.\xc2\xa0 The only X factor is whether Iran is going to sign on to an agreement that does all of those things.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is why all along we have continued to place the likelihood of success of this particular path at 50/50.\xc2\xa0 But because of the potential benefits that lie at the end of this path, that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes it\'s one that\xe2\x80\x99s worth pursuing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you may be aware, the Prime Minister said, the alternative isn\xe2\x80\x99t military action or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to be; it\'s a better deal.\xc2\xa0 Meaning, force Iran to dismantle its underlying nuclear technology so it can\xe2\x80\x99t have this capability and can\xe2\x80\x99t have a breakout potential.\xc2\xa0 Is the Prime Minister describing a world that he imagines but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually exist?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It certainly is not a plausible outcome in the minds of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And what is a plausible outcome is an outcome that has Iran voluntarily rolling back key aspects of their program, that has Iran agreeing to a set of monitoring restrictions that would allow international experts routine and frequent access to their nuclear facilities so that they can confirm for themselves that Iran is living up to their end of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is the best way for us to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last question.\xc2\xa0 On the DHS funding, does the administration consider, as the legal challenges continue, that a vote by the House implicitly endorses the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions on immigration?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply I am confident that there are people -- or at least I would hope that there are members of Congress who don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions but who do agree that we need to make sure that the Department of Homeland Security is properly and fully funded.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve said all along that these are two entirely separate issues.\xc2\xa0 If there are people who disagree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions, we welcome a conversation with them about comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 There is bipartisan ground for us to find.\xc2\xa0 There are some common-sense steps that we can take that will be good for our economy, that will ensure that we\xe2\x80\x99re living up to our values as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\xc2\xa0 There are things that we can do that would be even be good for the deficit and certainly would do more to take us away from the current system that is pretty much the closest thing that anybody can come up with to amnesty.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, coming back, Major asked a very direct question.\xc2\xa0 I want to try it again, and I want to plead to you, please do not refer me to the State Department.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask you something about the White House, and my question is a very basic one.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Before you ask it, though, I will do my best to not refer you to the State Department, but I want you to remember, though, that it is the responsibility of the State Department, that agency, to maintain their email system and to ensure the employees there are in compliance with the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So my direct question is:\xc2\xa0 Does the White House believe that Hillary Clinton broke the law?\xc2\xa0 Yes or no.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to refer me to the State Department.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do my best to answer your question.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has said that, at the request of the State Department, they have reviewed her records to make sure --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know what her team has said.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking, does the White House believe that Hillary Clinton broke the law, or that she fully complied with the law?\xc2\xa0 What does the White House believe?\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that his former Secretary of State broke the law, or that she fully complied with the law?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jon, if, in fact -- and again, you will have to go and verify this, and the State Department will have to verify this because we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t give me a direct answer to this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Just give me a chance.\xc2\xa0 That if, in fact, what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team said they were going to do, that they did, and that can be verified by the State Department who is responsible for maintaining these records, that would be entirely consistent with what the Federal Records Act requires.</p>\n<p>So again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position -- I was not in a position to review Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s personal email.\xc2\xa0 That was the responsibility of Secretary Clinton and her team.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they say that they did.\xc2\xa0 They say that they turned over thousands of pages and thousands of emails, including many that were already on the State Department system.\xc2\xa0 And that entirely consistent with the requirements of the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, let me ask you about something that was said at the podium in June of 2011.\xc2\xa0 This is while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 Jay Carney, your predecessor, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll our work is conducted on work email accounts.\xc2\xa0 We are definitely instructed that we need to conduct all of our work on government accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And I think that he was asked specifically about White House staffers, because there were questions that were raised about some work of White House staffers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can go back and look, but he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhile U.S. government policy -- certainly the administration policy -- that is effective here is that all of our work has to be conducted on work email accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So was the White House unaware that Hillary Clinton was not conducting her work on work email accounts when Jay said that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not Jay had traded emails with Secretary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 But --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he was speaking as the spokesperson for the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 And at the time there were very -- there was clear guidance that was given to White House staffers that is consistent with the guidance that agencies give to their employees, which is that official U.S. government work should be conducted on official U.S. government email systems.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why was Hillary Clinton not abiding by that guidance?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But when there are situations in which personal email is used to conduct official U.S. business, those emails are official government records and should be turned over to the State Department, which is what I understand Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But now we know that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have an official email account; that all of her email -- personal, official, all of it -- was done on a non-government email account.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the State Department is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for maintaining their email records, so you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to beg my forgiveness for --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we were told that government work was done on government emails.\xc2\xa0 That, I guess, was not correct.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that is the guidance that we give to employees -- again, because it is just more -- it saves you a step.\xc2\xa0 Federal employees in this administration work very hard, and the last thing we need to do is to ask them to take an additional step and make sure that they are --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Hillary never took that step.\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take that step until almost two years after she left office.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton -- Secretary Clinton benefits from something that most federal government employees don\xe2\x80\x99t have, which is a team around them that can review those emails and make sure that all of the emails that relate to her official government work can be properly sent to the State Department so that they can be maintained and preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the basic question is:\xc2\xa0 Were people in the White House, senior officials in the White House -- Zeke asked about the President; you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to talk about the President -- but were senior officials in the White House aware that Hillary Clinton was skirting this requirement and using her own personal email account?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is fair for you to characterize it that way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, you just acknowledged that the agencies were given guidance that they had to use -- they were to use work email for work business.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But there are situations, and when there are situations where personal email is used --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a minor exception.\xc2\xa0 This was all of her work.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 But the point is, Jon, is making sure that the records can be properly maintained and preserved.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has taken the necessary steps. According to them -- you should go ask them to confirm this -- but according to them, that\xe2\x80\x99s what they have done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s two years after she left office.\xc2\xa0 She was also doing this while she was Secretary of State.\xc2\xa0 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn the emails until she was out of office for 22 months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But the responsibility that Secretary Clinton and previous Secretaries of States have is to make sure that they have looked at their personal email account, collected all of the emails that relate to official government business -- because those are then, by definition, official government records, and those records need to be sent to the State Department so that they can be properly preserved and maintained in coordination with the National Archives and Records Administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I understand that the State Department has, in response to a legitimate congressional request, turned over some of those records to Congress.\xc2\xa0 That is the proper handling of those specific government records -- that they are maintained at the State Department and, when necessary, are used to respond to legitimate congressional requests.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last question.\xc2\xa0 Is any other Cabinet member in this administration using solely personal emails for government business?\xc2\xa0 Or is Hillary Clinton the one and only one who did that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You will need to check with each of the Cabinet agencies about --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t tell me if there are other Cabinet secretaries who are using personal email accounts for official business?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, the Cabinet secretaries -- you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask the individual agencies themselves, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the agencies themselves that are responsible for maintaining the records at their agency, but also responsible for maintaining the email system at their agency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you heard of anybody, a senior official at the White House who just uses personal email?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have not encountered that, no.\xc2\xa0 And I think most people handle it the way that I do, which is that we do our work on our official White House email address.\xc2\xa0 And on that rare occasion where we get an email to our personal account, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be responsive but also make sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s properly forwarded to our official White House government email address so that it can be properly preserved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, did you find it odd then to learn that the Secretary of State was not doing that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re very diligent about this, you keep your own records.\xc2\xa0 Did it surprise you -- the Secretary of State doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Look, I\'m not surprised by anything.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised by too many things in this job anymore.</p>\n<p>So, Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can we go back to Netanyahu and Iran a little bit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who knew that would be your favorite topic today.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It says something about the day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It does, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the White House\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of what the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s speech does in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sell this deal on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 If ultimately, if Iran -- if permanent sanctions, were they to mean -- these are two Republican houses that have now shown great enthusiasm and support for what Prime Minister Netanyahu said today.\xc2\xa0 Does that, in fact, kill the deal for President Obama if he can\xe2\x80\x99t sell it to Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 Let me take this in a couple of different parts.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President made pretty clear in the Oval Office when he was talking about this that he\xe2\x80\x99s not focused on the politics or on the theater, he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on resolving the threat from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 And so he is not going to be distracted from focusing on that threat and he\xe2\x80\x99s hopeful that others won\xe2\x80\x99t be either.</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that\xe2\x80\x99s true is that there was a lot of talk from Prime Minister Netanyahu criticizing, and in some cases even outright condemning, a deal that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been struck, a deal that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xc2\xa0 So the fact of the matter is there will be ample opportunity for Congress and for the American public to review any agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s struck between the Iranians and the international community, if such an agreement is struck.</p>\n<p>Now, what we have said is that the odds of that happening are at best 50/50.\xc2\xa0 But if we are able to complete this path, and we are able to reach an agreement that extends significantly Iran\xe2\x80\x99s breakout period and puts in place tough verification and inspection measures, then everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate the deal.\xc2\xa0 And at that point, we can have a discussion and maybe even a debate about whether or not the President is making the right judgment when he says that this is the best possible way for us to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re confident that if the agreement is reached and it reflects the kinds of outlines that the President himself has laid out, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the conclusion that fair-minded people will reach.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about fair-minded people, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Congress.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The transcript will reflect that you said that, not me.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s true on both sides, all sides.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a situation where you\xe2\x80\x99re in effect going to be asking Republicans to trust President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s judgment over Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\xc2\xa0 Can you honestly say you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a likely scenario?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I can say -- let me say a couple things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President is the one who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for looking out for American national security.\xc2\xa0 The Israeli Prime Minister himself acknowledged that he\xe2\x80\x99s primarily focused on Israeli national security.</p>\n<p>The good news is that because we\xe2\x80\x99re such close allies and because we share such deep common values, that those interests almost always align.\xc2\xa0 But it does mean that Prime Minister Netanyahu is taking a look at this situation from a slightly different perspective than individuals, including those individuals in Congress, who should be principally focused on American national security.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the first thing.</p>\n<p>The second thing is, members of Congress will have an opportunity to take a look at the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached between the Iranians and the international community.\xc2\xa0 And the other thing I think that is relevant here is that we did see a fair amount of skepticism both from Prime Minister Netanyahu and from some Republicans on the Hill about the interim agreement that was put in place between the United States and Iran, the so-called Joint Plan of Action.</p>\n<p>And this is an agreement that was put in place a little over a year ago that has been in place while these most recent negotiations have taken place.\xc2\xa0 And what that Joint Plan of Action did was it ensured daily access to Iranian nuclear facilities at Natanz and Fordow.\xc2\xa0 It essentially blocked the continued efforts to construct a heavy water reactor at Arak that would have provide a plutonium path to a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It put in place verification measures that would essentially allow daily access to those facilities.\xc2\xa0 And it put in place inspections measures that would prevent Iran from developing a covert path.\xc2\xa0 It eliminated Iran\xe2\x80\x99s stockpile of highly-enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 It capped their stockpile of low-enriched uranium.\xc2\xa0 They have not added any additional enrichment facilities.\xc2\xa0 They have not installed any additional centrifuges since this deal went into place.\xc2\xa0 And we have the international community in place to verify that they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived up to their terms of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The irony of this whole situation is that a year ago Prime Minister Netanyahu was calling this a historic mistake, but in his speech to Congress today he\xe2\x80\x99s suggesting that this agreement should remain in place in perpetuity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The point is, Prime Minister Netanyahu and other critics of our approach to resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program have routinely, time and again, criticized agreements before they\xe2\x80\x99d been struck, but then once they had been in place, frankly, touted their benefits.</p>\n<p>So I guess my point is there will be an opportunity for people to evaluate for themselves the wisdom of the approach that the administration is taking on this.\xc2\xa0 And the truth is, our track record on this is quite strong.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last question.\xc2\xa0 Is there any chance the President or Secretary Kerry would go back to the table and say, look, guys, look what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to deal with here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make this deal even stronger than the one I\xe2\x80\x99ve already proposed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President is already driving a hard bargain at the table -- making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to shut down the four paths to a nuclear weapon that Iran has available to them, making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, frankly, historically stringent inspection regimes in place to verify that Iran is living up to their end of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so we\xe2\x80\x99re already driving a very hard bargain here.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re doing this, frankly, in concert with our international partners, and that only strengthens our hand.\xc2\xa0 The international unity around this is something that is starkly different than what was in place when the President took office.\xc2\xa0 An approach that just relied solely on sanctions with no real hope of negotiations, frankly, fractured the international community and allowed the Iranian regime to, frankly, unify the opinion inside that country.\xc2\xa0 But under this President\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, we\xe2\x80\x99ve actually reversed that scenario where the international community is united and we see a lot of cracks in the Iranian government about the wisdom of trying to develop a nuclear weapons program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to revise the negotiating position of the American side at this point of the P5-plus-1?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s so strong.</p>\n<p>George.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you to elaborate on one thing the President said in the Oval Office?\xc2\xa0 He said foreign policy runs through the executive branch, through the President.\xc2\xa0 Does he view the speech today as an effort by Congress to usurp his constitutional prerogatives?\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that Congress, in arranging this speech, tried to go around the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 This is why you had representatives from the Israeli Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s office, or at least the Israeli government, working closely with representatives and the Speaker of the House without informing the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly no constitutional scholar, but it is clear that in our founding documents that our Founding Fathers envisioned the President of the United States and the Commander-in-Chief as being the principal policymaker when it comes to foreign policy and for representing the interests of the United States overseas.</p>\n<p>Now, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there\xe2\x80\x99s not a role for Congress, and I welcome a debate about the proper role for Congress, particularly when it comes to passing a right-sized authorization to use military force against ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there is a role for Congress to play when it comes to foreign policy, but in this situation we saw congressional leaders -- Republican congressional leaders, I might add -- try to do an end run around the executive branch, and that was a departure from protocol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And by saying that today so pointedly, is he trying to send a message to them that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stand for that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- I think the President was responding to a direct question that he\xe2\x80\x99d received from a journalist in the Oval Office, and it\xe2\x80\x99s entirely consistent with the case that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been making for weeks now that this represented a departure from protocol and certainly threatened to inject partisan politics in a relationship that has long benefitted from strong bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Despite that departure from protocol, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear the Prime Minister show respect to the President by saying he\xe2\x80\x99s done enormous things for Israel, things that are public, other things that are private that might be classified?\xc2\xa0 So why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President show the Prime Minister the respect of, A, watching the speech or, B, at least sending an official of some level -- any official -- to go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, two reasons for that, Ed.\xc2\xa0 The first is, the President was not able to watch Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech because he was preparing for and convened a meeting with our --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you added that right before the speech, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a meeting that had been in the works for at least a couple of weeks, and it was an opportunity for the President to visit with his counterparts in Europe about the urgent situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So this was an important foreign policy priority as well, and something the President was preparing for and leading in the midst of Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 But the President did show the Prime Minister the respect of reading his speech and both talking about it in public and even responding to a question about it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President said he heard no viable alternative from the Prime Minister, does that mean the President was expecting some sort of a plan for a deal with Iran or some other way to prevent Iran?\xc2\xa0 Did he want a plan?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, what the President had said is that the path that we are pursuing is the one that can most successfully address the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 If there are concerns about this plan, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to just sit on the sidelines and complain about a plan.\xc2\xa0 You are under some pressure and even an obligation, particularly if you consider this a priority, to present your own plan that you think would be better.\xc2\xa0 And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear that.\xc2\xa0 And the President would make the case, as he did in the Oval Office, that there is not a better plan that exists.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Except we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the plan is.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it hypocritical to say, Mr. Prime Minister, lay out the details of a plan when you\xe2\x80\x99re saying today, again, there is no deal.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99re worried about leaks and you don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of the details to come out.\xc2\xa0 So the Prime Minister doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, the American people don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 So how can you demand a plan from the Prime Minister when we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what your plan is?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I see what you did there, Ed.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the kids do on the Internet.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said you want a plan.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t know your plan.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is what\xe2\x80\x99s clear -- is the President has a very clear strategy that he has laid out, a plan for resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that is a plan that would extend the breakout period to 12 months, more than the two or three months that currently exist according to experts.</p>\n<p>And what also would be part of that deal is a proposal to put in place historically stringent inspection measures to ensure that Iran is living up to their end of the bargain.\xc2\xa0 And that is, in the mind of the President, the best possible way for us to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 If there is anyone out there -- a Republican, a Democrat, a leader in the Israeli government -- who thinks that they have a better way for resolving the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about their nuclear program, then we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them put that plan forward.</p>\n<p>What we know is that the military option does not do as much to resolve Iran\xe2\x80\x99s -- the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 This is the best possible path, and it depends, however, on one thing.\xc2\xa0 It depends on Iran and their political leadership making some difficult decisions to agree to this plan.\xc2\xa0 And there is reason for them to not.\xc2\xa0 It is a tough deal.\xc2\xa0 It requires them to roll back key aspects of their nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 It requires them to abandon what we know, despite their protestations, has been an objective of at least some government leaders in Iran, which is to develop a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we know it will require them to submit to the kind of inspections measures that they have previously resisted.</p>\n<p>So it is a tough deal.\xc2\xa0 There is a reason why some people in Iran may say no.\xc2\xa0 But it would clearly be in the best interest of the international community if Iran says yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick topics.\xc2\xa0 On Hillary Clinton, in answer to Jon when you said at least once \xe2\x80\x9caccording to them,\xe2\x80\x9d about Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s people, according to them, these are all the emails -- are you acknowledging that this White House has made no effort and is making no effort to determine whether or not your Secretary of State broke the law?\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re just laying it all on them?\xc2\xa0 Are you making any independent effort to find out if she broke the law?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of State Department officials to ensure that State Department employees are in compliance with the Federal Records Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t hold them accountable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And what those State Department officials have done is they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked all of the previous-serving Secretaries of State to forward their personal email records that may pertain to official government business.\xc2\xa0 If they have personal email records that pertain to official government business, those are official government records and they should be properly maintained and preserved by the State Department.\xc2\xa0 That is exactly what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team has done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple other quick questions on accountability as well.\xc2\xa0 This administration has been more aggressive than any other in trying to prosecute people for leaking classified information -- journalists who have either published or seen classified information working on stories -- and yet, General Petraeus, your Justice Department finds, leaked classified information.\xc2\xa0 And he gets off with a misdemeanor and is not doing any jail time.\xc2\xa0 What kind of signal does that send, that if you\xe2\x80\x99re a senior member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration, you leak classified information, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to jail but other people are?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t actually think that the Justice Department did find that he disclosed classified information.\xc2\xa0 The charge that he pled to was the improper handling of classified information.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s different than the disclosure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was a black book of code words, spy names, the President\xe2\x80\x99s briefings.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not classified information?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed, the charge that General Petraeus pled to was related to the improper handling of classified information.\xc2\xa0 That is different than the disclosure that you asserted.\xc2\xa0 For more details on that investigation, I would refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President believes that it was appropriate for General Petraeus to take responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last thing.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, you had a question from Bloomberg about executive action on taxes.\xc2\xa0 And some people are interpreting this that you left the door open to the President raising taxes by executive action.\xc2\xa0 Is that possible?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, what I will leave open is always the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use his executive authority to move the country in the right direction, to expand opportunity for the middle class --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t asking you about moving the country forward or backward.\xc2\xa0 Would the President raise taxes by executive action?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, there are laws that are in place that deal with Congress and their power of the purse.\xc2\xa0 And it is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to make decisions about the budget.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why we have had such an extensive conversation about the Department of Homeland Security.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward his own tax proposal for how he thinks we can work with Congress to close loopholes that only benefit wealthy and well-connected corporations, and use the revenue that\xe2\x80\x99s generated to invest in the kind of infrastructure that will create jobs and strengthen our economy over the long term.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what those policies are.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to specific steps the President may or may not take, I\'m not going to rule anything in or out.\xc2\xa0 This is related to the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to use his executive authority to do what he thinks is the right thing for the country.\xc2\xa0 That, after all, is what the American people elected him to do.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a lot of efficient production out of Congress over the last couple of months.\xc2\xa0 Maybe, however, with the passage of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ve turned a corner.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to try in the French way because Hillary Clinton is really a world figure, as you may know.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Hillary Clinton did a mistake in the White House opinion?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it -- did she do a mistake?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What Secretary Clinton and her team have done is they have complied with the guidelines of the Federal Records Act.\xc2\xa0 That is what the State Department agency is tasked with ensuring happens.\xc2\xa0 That is why they put in the request to Secretary Clinton and to the other Secretaries of State who have served in the email era.\xc2\xa0 These are Secretaries of State who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations.\xc2\xa0 They asked them to turn over records in their personal email accounts that may relate to the conduct of official U.S. business.\xc2\xa0 And they asked for those records so that they could be properly maintained and preserved at the Department of State.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Department of State would be responsible in the future, alongside the National Archives and Records Administration, to produce records in response to legitimate requests from Congress or from the public, or even, down the road, to historians that want to evaluate decisions that are made in this administration.</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way that these records should be properly handled.\xc2\xa0 That was the responsibility of Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team, and by their own reckoning here, they\xe2\x80\x99ve handled the situation properly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have another question on Ukraine. The President spoke today with President Hollande in a video teleconference.\xc2\xa0 What can you tell us about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President did convene a secure video teleconference with his counterparts from France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the European Council this morning in support of our continued efforts toward a negotiated solution to the conflict in Eastern Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 This, of course, follows a Normandy Group call among the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine that took place yesterday.</p>\n<p>You will also recall, at the end of last week the National Security Advisor Susan Rice convened a secure video teleconference with her counterparts in these European countries as well.\xc2\xa0 That was essentially the predicate for the meeting at the leader level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it was an opportunity, in the context of that meeting, for the President to condemn the continuing failure of Russia and the separatists it backs to abide by the commitments to which they agreed, first in the Minsk agreements in September of last year and, more recently, in the Minsk Implementation Plan, including the attack on Debaltseve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more detailed readout of that meeting a little later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 This will be a readout that reflects the views of all six countries that participated in the teleconference, so it takes a little while for us to get the readout signed off on, but I anticipate we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more details this afternoon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Carol.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to clarify, did any senior official in the White House know that Secretary Clinton did not have an official email account?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What I know is I know that the Secretary of State did trade emails with some White House officials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there were people in the White House who were aware of that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 They were aware of at least one email address that she was using.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether or not anyone at the senior level in the White House knew that she solely was using a personal email account?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 And, frankly, I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if anybody did.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is that it\'s the responsibility of the State Department to maintain these email systems.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if there is one email system that applies across the federal government.\xc2\xa0 Each agency is responsible for maintaining their own system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a view then on whether other Cabinet -- it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for other Cabinet officials to not have an official government email account?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, the guidance that other Cabinet officials is similar to the guidance that officials all across the government have gotten, which is that they should use their official government account for official government business.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s different than not having a government account.\xc2\xa0 So does this White House think it\xe2\x80\x99s okay for any other Cabinet official to not have a government account?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we think that if people choose to conduct government business on email, that they should do so using their official government account.\xc2\xa0 I guess if you choose not to do any government business on email, I guess it would be fine for you to not have a government account.</p>\n<p>The point is -- and this is the critical part, and this is what I think has attracted all of your attention -- is ensuring that official government records that exist in personal email accounts need to be properly maintained and preserved.\xc2\xa0 And they can do that by making sure that those emails are properly sent to the agency officials who are working with the National Archives and Records Administration to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So if you\xe2\x80\x99re not clear on what exactly is happening in terms of how senior officials throughout the administration are handling their use of email, how does that reflect on this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to being the most transparent administration in history?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Carol, what\xe2\x80\x99s important is it\xe2\x80\x99s important for everybody in the administration to abide by the guidelines that are laid out in the Federal Records Act.\xc2\xa0 And the President signed into law a bill at the end of last year that clarified exactly the guidelines and time frame under which individuals who have official government records in their personal email -- how they can ensure that those records are properly preserved and maintained in line with the standards that are set by the Federal Records Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is sort of at the core of it our chief concern, is making sure that these records are properly preserved, that they\xe2\x80\x99re properly maintained, that they can be used in response to legitimate congressional oversight, that they can be used to respond to legitimate inquiries from the public, that they can even be used by historians in the future who are trying to get greater insight into decision-making inside the administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the proper preservation and maintenance of those records is what we\xe2\x80\x99re after.\xc2\xa0 That is something that each agency is responsible for doing when it comes to records at their own agency.\xc2\xa0 They do this in conjunction and in partnership with the National Archives and Records Administration.\xc2\xa0 And, again, based on what we know about what Secretary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team did that they succeeded in that effort in making sure that those records are properly preserved and maintained.\xc2\xa0 And we have some evidence to back that up in that hundreds of those records, we know, have been turned over to Congress in response to legitimate oversight from Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Prime Minister Netanyahu, is there any concern within the White House that this is such a bilateral fight, meaning is there -- would the White House like some of the other leaders of the P5-plus-1 to back the President up on his view of taking on some of the criticism that the Prime Minister leveled today?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 To be blunt about it, no.\xc2\xa0 The President feels very confident in the position that he has taken.\xc2\xa0 And it reflects the views of our negotiating partners in the P5-plus-1. It also reflects the view of the broader international community. The President also is confident -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s been presented zero evidence to the contrary -- that the strategy that he is pursuing is the one that is best equipped to resolve the threat related to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>So the President is confident in this.\xc2\xa0 And the President, frankly, is looking forward to what he hopes will be an opportunity for the broader international community to evaluate the agreement that\xe2\x80\x99s been reached between Iran and the international community.</p>\n<p>But, ultimately, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require Iran to agree to some very tough things, both as it relates to rolling back key aspects of their nuclear program, but also as it relates to agreeing to the kind of monitoring requirements that they have previously chafed under.\xc2\xa0 So everybody will have an opportunity to evaluate the wisdom of this approach for themselves once a deal has been reached, if a deal has been reached.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President revise the deal if people don\xe2\x80\x99t like the deal?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the speech itself, Nancy Pelosi called it an insult to the intelligence of the U.S. as part of the P5-plus-1 and suggested it was condescending.\xc2\xa0 Is she right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an opportunity to see her comments.\xc2\xa0 I know that she was planning to attend the speech today and she\xe2\x80\x99s certainly entitled to her own opinion and her own reaction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it an insult to the intelligence of the U.S. as part of the P5-plus-1?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard very clearly the President\xe2\x80\x99s own reaction.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be distracted by the politics or the theater.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be focused on our goal, which is eliminating the threat from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, called it a powerful speech, even though she agrees largely with the position that you all are taking.\xc2\xa0 Would you call it a powerful speech?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is there any concern about the impact that it might have on public opinion?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What the President is confident of is that once there is an opportunity for us to evaluate a deal, if a deal is reached, that the President will be able to make a very persuasive case about how lengthening the breakout period and putting in place very tough monitoring restrictions -- or very tough monitoring requirements -- that we can make a very good case that this is the best possible way for us to confront the threat from Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program; that if we know that what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program on a daily basis, and if we know that at a minimum it would take Iran a year to break out and build a nuclear weapon, that we have resolved the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with that program.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve eliminated that threat.</p>\n<p>Now, it would require vigilance.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to require the international community and our international inspectors to continue to carefully inspect Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to have to be vigilant about making sure that Iran lives up to this deal.\xc2\xa0 But if we do, we know that Iran will not be able to acquire a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And that will prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 It will prevent Iran from being able to use that nuclear weapon to menace our strongest ally in the region, and it will strengthen the ability of the international community to deal with the volatility in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would a correct summary of the White House position on this speech be that you don\'t think it will have a negative impact -- negative from your perspective -- negative impact on either public opinion, on the ability of the President to sell the deal to Congress, or the negotiations themselves?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think the easiest way to distill the reaction from the White House is that it doesn\'t change the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind about the wisdom of the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s pursing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it may change the mind of people who he needs to get this deal done.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And it should raise serious questions in the minds of people who doubt that pursuit because no alternative has been presented.\xc2\xa0 And until there is, there is no reason to think that the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t right when he says that this strategy is the way that we can -- is the best possible way for us to resolve the international community\xe2\x80\x99s concerns with their nuclear program.</p>\n<p>Dave.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Since you came out to the podium there was a report from AP that a Justice Department investigation has found patterns of racial bias in the Ferguson Police Department. I assume the President knew this was coming.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a reaction from him yet?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he necessarily was.\xc2\xa0 This is -- the Department of Justice has indicated that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been investigating the Ferguson Police Department for some time now.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know that he necessarily was aware of the results of that investigation prior to its completion and release.\xc2\xa0 And I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the report that you\'re referring to, so I don\'t even know if it reflects a completed report, or just leaks about an investigation that\'s still underway.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99d be reluctant to comment on it from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more thing about Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s speech.\xc2\xa0 Both you and the President have used the word \xe2\x80\x9ctheater\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the speech, which implies entertainment value.\xc2\xa0 Is that really how the President looks at it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I had an opportunity to see some parts of the speech, and I know that there are others who noticed that there seemed to be some members of Congress who sort of seemed to be smiling and laughing and applauding along, which certainly doesn\'t seem to an appropriate response to a speech on such a significant topic.</p>\n<p>Now, I noticed that the Prime Minister certainly didn\'t have that demeanor.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that that contributed to the more theatrical aspects of today\xe2\x80\x99s event.</p>\n<p>Ali.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Hi.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Good to see you, too.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I also read you recently got engaged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I did.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So best wishes to you.\xc2\xa0 (Applause.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask -- I know this came up earlier very briefly about former CIA Director Petraeus\xe2\x80\x99s pleading guilty to mishandling classified information.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to know if the White House has a broader reaction to his plea today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, that\'s really it.\xc2\xa0 For more details about the investigation, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>All right, JC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been married for 23 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 Congratulations to you and your wife.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 If I may change the topic to ISIL, something we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about in a while.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About a week ago, the head of Egypt, President Sisi, recommended a, if you will, strong coalition of the willing Arab nations to combat ISIL in the region.\xc2\xa0 Was there any discussion today over that videoconference with the leaders -- these many leaders -- that that might be a good idea to join that coalition for really a universal coalition of the willing to fight ISIL?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a detailed readout of the teleconference, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have something later on this afternoon. I can just tell you as a general matter that the President is certainly very appreciative of the commitment that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from members of the coalition to this effort to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s taken a variety of forms, everything from trying to combat the movement of foreign fighters to countering the online activities of ISIL to radicalize citizens across the globe.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s included a comprehensive effort to shut down sources of funding for ISIL.\xc2\xa0 But it also has, of course, included a substantial commitment of military resources to fight ISIL.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are counting on countries in the region to take some responsibility for fighting ISIL.\xc2\xa0 And whether that is training local fighters -- we know that there are some countries in the region that have committed to host training programs for members of the moderate Syrian opposition so that they can be trained and equipped by our coalition partners so that they can take the fight to ISIL on the ground in their own country.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly would welcome those kinds of contributions to this broader effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t3:19 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
