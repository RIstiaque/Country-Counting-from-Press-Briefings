EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me do a little thing at the top and then we\'ll go to your questions. \xc2\xa0Since coming into office, President Obama has taken a number of steps to help students afford college, including doubling down investments in college scholarships by expanding Pell grants and the American Opportunity tax credit, making student loans more affordable by cutting interest rates, and allowing borrowers to cap student loan payments at 10 percent of income.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s also taken steps to simplify the federal student aid application known as FAFSA by simplifying the form and letting students and parents retrieve information electronically from the IRS. \xc2\xa0Students today, on average, fill out the FAFSA in about 20 minutes, only one-third of the time it took seven years ago. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, at North High School in Des Moines, the President will join Secretary Arne Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s bus tour to announce new steps that allow students and families to apply for financial aid earlier. \xc2\xa0Beginning in 2016, students and their families will be able to fill out the FAFSA in October, at the same time that they\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to apply to colleges, rather than in January. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLearning about their aid options much earlier in the college application\xe2\x80\x99s selection process will allow families to calculate the true cost of attending college and make even better decisions. \xc2\xa0Moving up the timing of the FAFSA will also make applying for aid easier, and more families will be able to access tax data for their applications.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is part of a weeklong series of back-to-school announcements by the administration, including the news you saw over the weekend that we unveiled a new College Scorecard that provides students and families to clear and easy to use national data on college cost, graduation rates, debt and post-graduate earnings among many other measures. \xc2\xa0And we\'re already starting to see people develop online tools using that data and essentially compiling it in a way that will allow people to make more informed decisions about which college is best for them.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd ultimately, policies that focus on opening up a college education to more middle-class families is a top priority that the President identified at the beginning of his presidency. \xc2\xa0And since then, he\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on achieving this objective. \xc2\xa0If we are going to lay the foundation for a long-term strength of our economy, we need to make sure that our workers have the skills and education that they need to compete and win in the 21st century global economy. \xc2\xa0So certainly expanding the doors -- expanding opportunity to a college education for more middle-class families is an excellent way to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, with that, let\xe2\x80\x99s take your questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if you guys have noticed, but you\'re heading to a state where there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of candidates running to succeed Obama. \xc2\xa0How much did the campaign factor into the decision to go to Des Moines? \xc2\xa0And does the President see this as an opportunity to draw attention to Democratic policies, draw a contrast with Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say two things. \xc2\xa0The first is this is actually the second stop on Secretary Duncan\xe2\x80\x99s bus tour.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- in states, so you had some other options.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to wait until the end. \xc2\xa0We wanted to go early on in his tour. \xc2\xa0And there certainly is a good record that North High School in Des Moines has to tell about sending their students to college.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut to get to the heart of your question, the President would really like to see a robust debate in the context of the 2016 campaign about what we can do to strengthen our economy and open up college education to more middle-class students. \xc2\xa0This is going to be critically important to the long-term success of our country and our economy. \xc2\xa0And it would be good for the country for there to be a robust debate among the candidates on this issue. \xc2\xa0We would welcome a variety of candidates putting forward a variety of ideas about what we can do to make college more affordable and to put a college education within reach of more students.</p>\n<p>\n\tUltimately, it\'s going to be good for all those middle-class families out there. \xc2\xa0It\'s certainly going to be good for our economy moving forward. \xc2\xa0It also happens to be an issue that a lot of middle-class families across the country are talking about. \xc2\xa0Even families with younger children are already beginning to have the conversation in their family about what kind of -- how they can save to make sure that they can send their kids to college. \xc2\xa0And there are plenty of students who recently graduated from college that are now facing a significant challenge in paying back the debt that they have accrued. \xc2\xa0They certainly have gotten an education, but now they need to be able to pay back those loans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a debate that a lot of Americans are having right now, and these are decisions that drive the basic financial decisions in houses across the country. \xc2\xa0And so if today\xe2\x80\x99s event has the effect of prompting more candidates to lay out their vision for how we can open up the access to a college education for middle-class families, then we\xe2\x80\x99d be pretty happy about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that goes for Democrats or Republicans. \xc2\xa0This falls in the category of areas where Democrats and Republicans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t break down along party lines. \xc2\xa0There are a lot of Republican candidates in the field who understand the value of education, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re governors of states that have invested in their institutions of higher learning, or they understand firsthand the impact that these kinds of policies could have. \xc2\xa0So if that\'s the impact of today\xe2\x80\x99s event then we\xe2\x80\x99d be pretty pleased.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You mentioned governors. \xc2\xa0There are governors that are running for President who have, according to the administration, have not invested enough in the higher education or funding for education. \xc2\xa0Do you expect the President to talk about that, to maybe call out by name some of the candidates who haven\'t spent enough of taxpayer dollars on education?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t want to get ahead of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks. \xc2\xa0The goal of this trip is not to comment on one particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s policies, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Democrats in general tend to prioritize educating our workforce and expanding access to a college education for middle-class families. \xc2\xa0That\'s something that many Republicans haven\'t prioritized. \xc2\xa0But surely, Democrats and Republicans should be able to agree on the notion this would be a good thing for our country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to break down along party lines. \xc2\xa0But in some cases, there have -- there are candidates with a record of not prioritizing college education. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\'t put it passed the President to say something about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, you all know that the President will have an opportunity to take some questions from the audience at the high school today, so to the extent that people ask about the positions of any of the candidates that are in the race, the President may comment about them there as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One other issue. \xc2\xa0You ticked off earlier what the administration has done sort of early to easing the student loan process. \xc2\xa0But a lot of people say, well, the cost of a higher education has increased -- it\'s something like 10 or 15 times the rate of inflation since the 1970s. \xc2\xa0So what can you say about the administration\xe2\x80\x99s efforts for actually lowering or at least stopping the rise -- exponential rise in cost of a college education?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0One of the reasons particularly at state and public institutions of higher education -- one of the reasons that we\'re seeing tuition go up is because state-level investments in those institutions are going down. \xc2\xa0And that is placing an additional burden on middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are some things that can be done at the state level, and there\xe2\x80\x99s some additional support that can be provided by the federal government to those efforts, and that could potentially have the effect of limiting growth in tuition. \xc2\xa0At the same time, many leaders of colleges and universities understand the impact of rising tuition and rising college costs and we have seen more of a concerted effort in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the Great Recession, where institutions of higher learning are trying to make a serious effort to limit the growth in costs. \xc2\xa0We obviously believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s more that can be done in that regard and we would encourage them to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third thing is I made a reference to the announcement that we made over the weekend in terms of providing more data to students and their parents about the array of educational opportunities that are available to them. \xc2\xa0And some of the things that are included in that data are things like the debt load that is borne by graduates from a particular institution, or the average earnings that are available to graduates or that are typical of graduates from a particular institution. \xc2\xa0That can give you a good sense of the capacity that those graduates have to pay back their college loans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there are a variety of ways to approach this. \xc2\xa0What we\'re focused on right now is sort of the ability of students to qualify for and get access to assistance they receive from the federal government in paying for a college education. \xc2\xa0But we certainly are mindful of the work that can be done on the other side of the equation to try to reduce the cost.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask about Ambassador Rice\xe2\x80\x99s meeting on the weekend with her counterparts from China? \xc2\xa0Does this suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be action on cyber issues before President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me first say that Secretary Meng -- I don\'t know if he is necessarily her counterpart, but the reason that she was participating in these conversations with U.S. officials is that he is often described as the point person in the Chinese government for cyber issues. \xc2\xa0And so that was the reason for his visit. \xc2\xa0As you saw from the readout that we put out over the weekend, he had meetings with an array of Obama administration officials to discuss that issue. \xc2\xa0That included some national security officials, some law enforcement officials, and then White House officials, including Ambassador Rice.</p>\n<p>\n\tI can tell you that there was a pretty candid exchange of views. \xc2\xa0We\'ve been pretty blunt in describing the concerns that we have with China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in cyberspace. \xc2\xa0We have been blunt in our assessment that that has significant consequences for our economy and for our national security. \xc2\xa0And we certainly were pleased to have the opportunity to have that discussion with the Chinese, and I would anticipate that that discussion will continue when the President has the opportunity to meet with his counterpart.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you haven\'t been blunt publicly at least on that OPM hack, specifically, as it relates to China. \xc2\xa0Privately, was Rice more blunt about China\xe2\x80\x99s role in that? \xc2\xa0Will the President be more blunt with Xi when he comes to town?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s not a whole lot more detail I can provide about the conversations that took place at the end of last week and over the weekend. \xc2\xa0But I do think that Secretary Meng\xe2\x80\x99s visit does illustrate that the Chinese government understands that the Obama administration is very serious about the level of concern we have with China\xe2\x80\x99s activity in cyberspace.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd whether that is, last year, the announcement of the indictment against five Chinese military officials for hacking, or other concerns that we\xe2\x80\x99ve raised about China\xe2\x80\x99s activity publicly, it should be clear to everyone in the United States, the same way that I now think it\xe2\x80\x99s clear to Chinese officials, that this is an issue that the President himself is quite concerned about. \xc2\xa0And the President, on previous occasions when he\xe2\x80\x99s met with his counterpart, has raised this concern, and I would anticipate that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do so in their next meeting, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any updates on whether we\xe2\x80\x99ll see sanctions against Chinese individuals before Xi\xe2\x80\x99s visit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional update on the timing of sanctions. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s typical of the way that we pursue the sanctions policy, is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it in advance because doing so only allows the potential targets of those sanctions to take steps to try to evade them before they\xe2\x80\x99re put in place. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a whole lot more information about that in advance of any action taken, if any action is taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The readout of those meetings that -- FBI Director James Comey also was part of these discussions. \xc2\xa0Can you describe what his role was or why he was involved in the discussions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there is a role for law enforcement in this issue. \xc2\xa0As I mentioned, it was the Department of Justice that announced the indictment of five Chinese military officials, I believe this was last summer or last spring, for some of their cyber activity. \xc2\xa0So there is a role for law enforcement, so it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate that he would be a part of those discussions. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that I would say is there is an expertise that\xe2\x80\x99s built up at the FBI, and the FBI is often responsible for conducting a lot of investigations after we detect that intrusions have taken place. \xc2\xa0So I guess the point is there are a variety of ways in which law enforcement is involved in this particular issue. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s why it was appropriate for the Director of the FBI to participate, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you worried at all about the optics at this point? Threats of sanctions, the President not staying at the Waldorf Astoria anymore -- are you worried that this whole thing could sort of be blown up? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be this ceremonial state visit, but it seems like there\xe2\x80\x99s all these -- this sort of cloud hanging over the visit at this point with frank talk about cybersecurity, the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments on Friday about how if China wants a war on cyber, that the U.S. would be involved and the U.S. would win that war. \xc2\xa0Do you worry that things have become sort of ominous concerning this visit so far?<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that. \xc2\xa0And principally, the reason for that is simply that we had this public discussion about our concerns about some of China\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in cyberspace in advance of meetings between the two Presidents. \xc2\xa0I remember standing in this spot on this airplane when we were flying to Sunnylands in advance of the President\xe2\x80\x99s first meeting with President Xi, where we talked about the likelihood that President Obama would raise concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s cyber activity. \xc2\xa0So this is typical of the lead-up to presidential-level meetings between the United States and China.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat said, while there certainly are areas of competition between the United States and China, there are also important areas of cooperation. \xc2\xa0And whether it\xe2\x80\x99s on climate issues or confronting Iran over their nuclear program, we have been able to effectively coordinate with the Chinese to advance the interests of the citizens of both of our countries. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there will be extensive discussion of some of those issues, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have the Chinese expressed any concerns about U.S. cyber activity? \xc2\xa0I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly passive in this regard.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional details about their conversation to -- about the conversations that took place at the end of last week and over the weekend to share. \xc2\xa0For any concerns that the Chinese officials may have raised, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any comment on Scott Walker\xe2\x80\x99s labor proposal that he\xe2\x80\x99s rolling out today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I have to be honest, I have not seen the details of that particular proposal. \xc2\xa0Based on his record, I suspect it may not be a proposal with which we would entirely agree, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the details of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you give us the latest on where things stand with the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the migrant crisis? \xc2\xa0And do you have any response to the steps that Germany has taken in recent days?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The work of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team to review what additional steps the United States can take to ramp up our response to this crisis is ongoing. \xc2\xa0Obama administration officials continue to be in touch with their counterparts in Europe to discuss this issue. \xc2\xa0And this is a genuine human tragedy. \xc2\xa0There are hundreds of thousands if not millions, of people that are in a desperate situation. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the United States to consider what we can do to step up in a situation like this. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly consistent with our values as a country, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also consistent with the expectations of the international community. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen there is a significant international crisis, the United States is looked upon to play a leading role in responding. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that thus far. \xc2\xa0The United States is still the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance. \xc2\xa0And we continue to assess what additional steps we can take to scale up our response to meet what is a widespread crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What about Germany, the steps that Germany has taken? \xc2\xa0Do you have any reaction to that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Obviously, the German government has scaled up their response. \xc2\xa0And there are lots of things that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen publicly from the German government and from German citizens that demonstrate a recognition of the humanity of those migrants, and that is a response that\xe2\x80\x99s worth complimenting.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, no one country can solve this urgent crisis on their own. \xc2\xa0And we are going to need to see other countries step up and play their part to respond to this crisis. And whether that is other countries in Europe agreeing to accept additional migrants, or countries in the region making more significant financial contributions to the humanitarian response, there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a bit more that can be done. \xc2\xa0And the President is serious about the United States trying to lead by example. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that, and it\xe2\x80\x99s time for other countries to step up, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quite aside from the humanitarian situation, is there a reassessment of what can be done to tackle the underlying causes of that crisis? \xc2\xa0I mean, is the administration reconsidering its position on no-fly zones, for example?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Andrew, we have said particularly when confronting this issue in Syria that ultimately the root cause of all the violence and the corresponding humanitarian situation is the failed political leadership of Bashar al-Assad. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why a number of years ago, the President said that Mr. Assad had lost the legitimacy to lead that country, and why we believed a political transition needed to take place that resulted in Mr. Assad leaving power.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat continues to be our position. \xc2\xa0The United States has tried repeatedly to facilitate -- or support the efforts of the U.N. to facilitate a political transition in that country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an effort that\xe2\x80\x99s struggled to gain traction. \xc2\xa0And the United States -- well, the President has asked his team to continually reassess if there are things that we can do that might hasten the kind of transition that we believe is necessary, and for that transition to happen in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with not just the interests of the Syrian people, but with the interests of greater stability in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut there are no -- we have been pretty forthright about the fact that there are no easy answers here. \xc2\xa0But this is something that we continue to be focused on. \xc2\xa0And the consequences for eventually finding a solution here are significant, and the consequences for not resolving that situation increase by the day -- whether that\xe2\x80\x99s more destabilization in an already volatile region of the world, or greater violence from ISIL, or an even worse humanitarian situation with regard to people who are fleeing the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there a way for an Assad government -- how quickly would you -- is there a scenario under which Assad could stay in power for a year, or two years? \xc2\xa0Would that be acceptable for the U.S. as long as he would eventually leave?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to handicap any of the available options. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution to the situation in Syria; it needs to be a diplomatic one. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s one that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to facilitate. \xc2\xa0And we would like to see leadership in Syria that has a legitimacy to lead, that has the confidence of the Syrian people, and reflects the will and ambition of the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s not clear that Mr. Assad has any of that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to effect a political transition in that country. \xc2\xa0The international community is involved and playing the role in trying to facilitate that transition, but as I mentioned before, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretty candid about the fact that that effort has not gained a lot of traction. \xc2\xa0But it still continues to be an effort that the United States supports.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any more clarity as to what Russia is up to in Syria?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be blunt, not really. \xc2\xa0We continue to believe that additional Russian support for the Assad regime would be destabilizing and counterproductive. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just me saying that publicly -- that is a message that Secretary Kerry has conveyed to Foreign Minister Lavrov in more than one private conversation in the last couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is clear, as some of the coverage over the last 48 hours indicates, that the interests of the Russians in Syria are not in complete conflict with the interests of the rest of the world. \xc2\xa0Russians certainly have their concerns about violent extremism. \xc2\xa0The Russians certainly have their concerns about further volatility in an already dangerous region of the world, particularly in a country that essentially has functioned as a client state of theirs and where Russia has significant investments. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s why we, in our conversations, we have urged the Russians to consider how they could constructively coordinate their efforts with the more than 60-member coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the President hope to meet with Putin at UNGA to talk about this a little bit more?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings to tell you about at this point that the President will host while he\xe2\x80\x99s in New York in a couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0But as we get closer, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to tell you about more of the meetings that the President has planned.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just ask the simple question of if you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t understand what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President pick up the phone and call President Putin? \xc2\xa0Is that because the answers that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been given in lower-level conversations are not sufficient, or because you don\xe2\x80\x99t think he would actually say what they\xe2\x80\x99re up to or that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be productive in some way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the best way for me to answer that question is that as it is clear that Russia continues to take these actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed some concern about into Syria, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to try to get the best sense that we can about what their plans are. \xc2\xa0And that will depend on obviously Russia continuing to shape this policy and to consider the range of options that are available to them. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out additional -- or I certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out future presidential-level conversations on this topic and others. \xc2\xa0And the President has the kind of relationship with President Putin where, for all their differences, the President does feel like they have the kind of relationship that allows them to be pretty blunt with one another. \xc2\xa0And so at the appropriate time, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out a presidential conversation at this time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If the Russians decide not to join the coalition and just go it alone and essentially support Assad, what are the costs for Russia in doing that? \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s preventing them from doing that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I certainly would -- I think there are a couple of things. \xc2\xa0The first is that it would isolate them from the international community even further. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99d be at cross-purposes with the 60 or so other nations that are supporting the U.S.-led coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second is you can imagine that it would make those counter-ISIL efforts even more difficult, and I just got through saying that Russia has an interest in the success of that counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0Russia would certainly like to see the successful implementation of a strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe third thing is that as the President said in his town hall on Friday, doubling down on Assad is not going to be a successful strategy for Russia. \xc2\xa0The international community has decided that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Assad to go. \xc2\xa0He clearly has lost legitimacy to lead. \xc2\xa0He has lost the confidence of those citizens of his country -- at least the ones that -- or I guess I should say particularly the ones that he is using the resources of the military to attack. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- again, this is part of the case that we have made to the Russians about how they could constructively contribute to the situation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Friday, the President ascribed some of what Russia is doing in Syria to, like, a nervousness or an anxiety on Assad\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. \xc2\xa0So if you don\xe2\x80\x99t, like, I guess if you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what Russia is doing, you at least have some sense of what the motivation for them being there is, at least based on what the President said. \xc2\xa0So can you describe in any more detail what he meant by that when he said he thought Assad was nervous and that\xe2\x80\x99s why Russia was there? \xc2\xa0Is that based on intelligence?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say generally that a lot of people have publicly speculated that Assad\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power is weakening. \xc2\xa0And there are a variety of ways to measure that -- certainly one way to measure that is that the amount of area inside of Syria that he controls is shrinking. \xc2\xa0And there are some areas where he not too long ago exercised significant authority that he no longer controls. \xc2\xa0And, again, based on the broad sentiment of the international community, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Assad is weakened, that he is isolated, and the prospects for his remaining in power are trending in what is for him the wrong direction. \xc2\xa0And, again, that\xe2\x80\x99s why -- and this is even after significant investments that Russia has already made in trying to shore him up. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President was pretty candid about his view that it was not a wise investment for Russia to double down on Assad.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Question on the refugee goal for Syrians. \xc2\xa0Is your position that you don\xe2\x80\x99t need congressional action to increase the cap on the number of Syrian refugees that would come to the U.S. next year or just a broader cap on refugees globally that would come to the U.S., or is that something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to need congressional action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The way that this has been described to me -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked this question a couple of times myself -- the way that our policy people have explained this to me is that there is no specific congressional action that is required to move the cap, either the overall cap or the cap on individual countries. \xc2\xa0But significant movements in the cap will have fiscal consequences and raising the cap significantly will cost more money and, of course, that would require congressional action to get the money that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to implement the policy change.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo there is a role for Congress in this. \xc2\xa0Right now, we have not concluded that it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to ask for additional funding in order to accomplish the goal that the President has set out for next fiscal year, which is to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you expect that to change as you get more information about how much this is going to cost?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There certainly is the potential for that in the future, but as of right now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\tCan we just do one other thing, which is that when the President arrives in Des Moines, the President will be spending about 45 minutes or an hour or so with a woman named Marilynne Robinson. \xc2\xa0Marilynne is an Iowa-based novelist and writer, and she will be doing a conversation, an interview with the President that will be published in the coming weeks in The New York Review of Books. \xc2\xa0So this will not be sort of a breaking-news interview situation, but it hopefully will be a thoughtful conversation that will be published at a later date. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe eventual publication date is still TBD. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously let you know when that\'s resolved. \xc2\xa0It probably won\xe2\x80\x99t be resolved today. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work to at least give you guys a chance to see the two of them together before they sit down for their conversation. \xc2\xa0So stay tuned on that. \xc2\xa0That will be on the front end before we go to North High School.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So on camera, like, the whole interview? \xc2\xa0Or is it being videotaped by someone?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It will not be on camera. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence that the TV pool producer is asking me that question, which is totally fine. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If he wants to come back and interview with us after. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:26 P.M.
