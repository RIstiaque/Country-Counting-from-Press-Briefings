EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President had complained on the campaign trail about deals that get cut behind closed doors.\xc2\xa0 Is he at all upset about the work of the conference committee or the negotiation, in general, that this didn\'t take place more publicly?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the debate about this bill has taken place very publicly.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve all -- I\'ve been asked about it for several weeks now.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s hard to imagine that people\'s opinions haven\'t been known.\xc2\xa0 And I think the events of the last few days have shown that Democrats and Republicans can work together to get something done.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think it looks as if we\'ll get a vote tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'re on the cusp of something that\'s a very important first step in order to get our economy moving again.\xc2\xa0 It\'s just one of the steps that we have to take, but it is a little more than three weeks into this administration.\xc2\xa0 It will be an historic investment in creating jobs and putting people back to work, investing in many areas, like health care and energy independence, that we\'ve neglected over the past many years.\xc2\xa0 And I think it will put money into taxpayers\' pockets that we think they\'ll spend to get the economy going.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the campaign I\'m pretty sure it was on your website that you said that all bills should have some kind of public comment period and they should be posted on the website for five days before the President signs it.\xc2\xa0 What are you going to do about this one?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That included non-emergency legislation.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ahhh -- the waiver.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 There was a waiver.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s not a waiver, it was written right there on the website.\xc2\xa0 We are working out a series of procedures to ensure that -- for non-emergency legislation, that people do have five days to look at the legislation that\'s been passed by Congress before it\'s signed into law.\xc2\xa0 There have been some -- we\'re working through the technicalities of how that happens and we\'ll get a process together.\xc2\xa0 I know there\'s something up on the White House blog on this right now, or has been within the past few days.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, if we get this bill, this would certainly meet the President\'s test of emergency legislation.\xc2\xa0 And if we\'re lucky enough to have it pass, we\'ll sign it rather quickly.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just have a question about that.\xc2\xa0 What would be the point of the public only getting to look at it by the time it\'s been completely passed and the President is about to sign it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, by then it\'s kind of all over.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, I\'m amazed at the number of differing hurdles that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just curious.\xc2\xa0 You know, you didn\'t post it while it was in progress.\xc2\xa0 In other words, you\'re just waiting until the very end --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Mara, people can go to the same website you go to when you read bills.\xc2\xa0 There\'s congress.gov, there\'s the Library of Congress.\xc2\xa0 There are any number of resources.\xc2\xa0 I can only imagine that your reporting is informed by the careful examination of that very legislation throughout the process --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m just wondering why you wanted the five days in the first place.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to put out -- for people to understand -- I think we\'ve seen instances where legislation is done quickly and it\'s important for people to get a look at what\'s in those bills.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President outlined that policy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the President\'s reaction to one change in particular, the reduction of the tax relief from -- down to $400, and $800 for couples?\xc2\xa0 What does he think of that both in terms of the symbolic change or the substantive change that that would have?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- look, he understands -- and as I said this yesterday -- that my guess is that there are 536 people that might have written any number of things slightly differently.\xc2\xa0 The President campaigned on a Make Work Pay tax cut for 95 percent of working families because he thought it was important that we get money back into their pockets directly.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, though, it\'s important, as I said, not to make the perfect the enemy of what\'s absolutely necessary.\xc2\xa0 And we -- though we\'d rather see some provisions slightly different, the broader plan we think will save or create 3 to 4 million jobs and put people back to work.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the ultimate test that the President has.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And certainly we\'d like to see the most tax relief we can.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'ll see a pretty -- contained within that, one of the most progressive and largest tax cuts that go directly to working families that any Congress has ever passed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christina Romer\'s hypothetical, when she came up with the 3 to 4 million jobs based on a stimulus package, this one still meets her criteria?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President signs this bill once its voted on, how long will it take for the money to actually get to the pipeline?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can check exactly.\xc2\xa0 I think within -- I think basically aid will start coming within a month.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a more precise answer.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there are certainly different ways, whether the money comes through state aid for particular projects, whether it comes through infrastructure.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I also think there will be -- and we\'ll see this this afternoon, I think, in Caterpillar -- you\'ll see, in some ways, people anticipating the benefits of a stimulus package and changing the business decisions that they make.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got the CEO of Caterpillar, which we\'re going to go see today, that has told the White House that they would reevaluate decisions that they\'ve made about hiring, based on the passage of this bill.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\'ll get a chance, as we land in Peoria, to see how a package like this is playing in Peoria.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CEO of Caterpillar also was worried about the "Buy American" provision.\xc2\xa0 And is that something that could, in the end, hurt companies that you\'re -- that we\'re trying to help?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think what the -- I think where we ended up with the "Buy American" provision is the right compromise that respects the "Buy American" laws that we have had on our books for many, many years, while also ensuring that the language doesn\'t create unnecessary trade disagreements in a time of economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 I doubt he would -- I doubt he\'d be making some of the positive comments about the bill if he thought that that was -- that legislative provision was a non-starter.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does the President think about getting more Republican votes in the next 48 hours or so on this bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 We\'d welcome it.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How good are the prospects?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think some of that depends on -- I think some of that obviously depends on individual lawmakers looking at the plan.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, many of them wanted a package that wasn\'t too big.\xc2\xa0 Many of them wanted a package that included more tax cuts.\xc2\xa0 Many of them wanted a package that spent the money in a spend-out rate that would stimulate the economy quickly.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\'s any doubt that the test that had been laid out by many of the critics of this package are met by the final package.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And look, you know, I\'ve seen people argue on the floor the definition of bipartisan doesn\'t include three Republicans being part of a solution.\xc2\xa0 That\'s, as best I can tell, a pretty good chunk of the U.S. Senate, and we\'re happy to have their support, and happy to have any Republican support.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I also would say there\'s -- I think there are a lot of Republicans around the country -- there\'s certainly Republican mayors that don\'t want to lay off police officers and teachers,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 there\'s Republican governors that don\'t want to cut health care for working families that are supportive of this bill.\xc2\xa0 There are Republicans outside of the friendly confines of Washington, D.C., that understand the importance of getting something done to help the people of their locality or their state and certainly of their country.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Geithner is going to the G7 to meet with his G7 counterparts this weekend.\xc2\xa0 What are -- now that this stimulus is almost done, what are you going to be looking for from the other G7 partners?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President talked about this as far back as September during the campaign at the -- right after the economic -- right after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which was that the G7, and particularly the G20, all had to work in concert together, because if one entity -- if one country or one group of countries move without the world moving together, it\'s likely that the impact of some of this would be mitigated.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So obviously, Secretary Geithner I think will be talking about how we can coordinate our activities so that we can all stimulate our respective economies.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, financial stability will be something that is on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 And I think also -- and this will be -- play a bigger role as we get closer to the April G20 meeting, which is financial regulatory reform to ensure that what got us here doesn\'t happen again.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think just as the President has talked about a series of steps that have to happen to see an economic recovery in full, I think that those are all true internationally, as well.\xc2\xa0 And I think the Secretary will be working with his counterparts to ensure that we take collective global and international action to ensure greater growth and stability.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, a question about Caterpillar.\xc2\xa0 The company has said that they --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hope his flight to Italy will be smoother than this.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They pay -- they say they pay like a $100,000 in tariffs to export to Colombia on a single piece of heavy equipment.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President on the implementation -- the re-implementation of the free trade agreement, and how does that apply?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, his position on Colombia is unchanged from the campaign.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the -- both as it relates to labor and environmental regulations, as well as some human rights violations regarding labor leaders in Colombia, the President has concerns with the way the agreement is written.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But I think that is -- the President and Mr. Owens are certainly in accord on the importance of getting this recovery plan done in a timely way to help the people that we\'re about to go see, and help the rest of the country.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And have they also talked about this agreement?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if they\'ve talked about it today.\xc2\xa0 I can certainly talk to the President, and see if he\'s -- if they\'ve -- it\'s come up today.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any members on board?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I know we have Congressman Schock, who represents the area.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll check on others who might be.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick question.\xc2\xa0 CNN is doing a little video where they morph the Lincoln image into the Obama image, or maybe it\'s the other way around.\xc2\xa0 Have we reached the point now where you think maybe we might be going a little too far with the Lincoln parallels, or not?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know you didn\'t, obviously, put that together.\xc2\xa0 But you guys do --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'d love editorial control of one of the cable networks, if that\'s -- (laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, look, I -- look, I think as the President said today, we\'re all -- we all each day live with -- in a society because of many of the tough and courageous decisions that President Lincoln had to make a long time ago.\xc2\xa0 But this President isn\'t seeking to compare himself with I think what many believe is one of the two or three greatest Presidents that this country has ever had.\xc2\xa0 There are decisions and stresses that President Lincoln faced that I think many would hope aren\'t faced by many of our Presidents as we go forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I mean, there are parallels I think that make it hard for some to ignore:\xc2\xa0 the Illinois factor, spending roughly the same amount of time in Springfield and the same amount of time in Congress.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- I think the parallels don\'t go a whole lot beyond that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Obviously, we\'re tremendously grateful to be able to come here and celebrate, at the second event, the life of somebody who had such a tremendous impact.\xc2\xa0 And his impacts we feel even today.\xc2\xa0 Plus, I got this spiffy new penny for my son.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much did that cost you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President gave it to me.\xc2\xa0 So I guess I owe him a penny.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s that on the back?\xc2\xa0 Is that like a commemorative penny or something?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\'s the -- I guess they released four today.\xc2\xa0 And this has the log cabin.\xc2\xa0 And my son is fairly obsessed now with -- they studied the Presidents around the election.\xc2\xa0 And when we walked into the President\'s -- when we walked into the Oval Office when he was in the White House about a week and a half ago, we were looking into the President\'s study and he says, "Dad, that\'s John Quincy Adams."\xc2\xa0 And I said, "Are you sure?"\xc2\xa0 And he says, "Dad, he was the sixth President of the United States."\xc2\xa0 So he\'s ahead of me on the President\'s stuff.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">So, thanks guys.</div> <div class="legacy-para">END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 3:34 P.M.
