Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:23 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 A bit of a late-arriving crowd for the front row.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There you go -- which I know you encourage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to oblige.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements.\xc2\xa0 So, Nedra, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we get started with questions today.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Hillary Clinton said if she\xe2\x80\x99s elected President, and Congress won\xe2\x80\x99t do comprehensive immigration reform legislation, that she\xe2\x80\x99ll expand on the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions.\xc2\xa0 But the President has said that he\xe2\x80\x99s already expanded authorities as far as he legally can under existing statute.\xc2\xa0 So has he changed his opinion on that?\xc2\xa0 Or what are his thoughts?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, the President\xe2\x80\x99s views on this have not changed.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, we did take the extraordinary step of releasing the Office of Legal Counsel opinion, where we talked about the limits of executive authority when it comes to taking steps to reform our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 The President was determined to use as much of his authority as he could to try to bring some much needed accountability to our broken immigration system.\xc2\xa0 And that was reflected in the announcement that he made back in November on this.</p>\n<p>As you know, there\xe2\x80\x99s a portion of those steps that currently is bottled up in the courts down in Texas.\xc2\xa0 But this is a -- we continue to be extremely confident of our legal position and of our legal arguments, and that\xe2\x80\x99s working its way through that process.\xc2\xa0 There are other elements of these reforms, however, that are moving forward that we are implementing.\xc2\xa0 The most prominent of those is some of the discretion that our law enforcement officers are exercising when it comes to prioritizing the cases of those individuals who pose a genuine threat to the community.\xc2\xa0 Those are the individuals that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to protect broader communities from.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if a future President were to expand beyond what he had done, would that be illegal?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, that will be something for future Presidents and ultimately future courts to decide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about Baltimore?\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to weigh in on whether Attorney General Lynch should open an investigation into a pattern of discrimination in the Baltimore police department?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 This is a decision for the Attorney General to make.\xc2\xa0 And the newly confirmed Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, is certainly eminently qualified to make this decision.\xc2\xa0 So she\xe2\x80\x99s somebody who dedicated a significant portion of her career to being a federal prosecutor, and she has a very good understanding of the way that those law enforcement and prosecutorial enterprises should conduct themselves.</p>\n<p>There is responsibility for the Department of Justice to ensure that justice is being administered fairly.\xc2\xa0 And she will make the decision about what role is appropriate for the Department of Justice to play in this particular matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There already are two things that are underway here that are worth pointing out.\xc2\xa0 The first is, there is a Department of Justice investigation into the death of Freddie Gray, while he was in the custody of the Baltimore police department.\xc2\xa0 And dating back to last fall, there was interest expressed by local officials in Baltimore to have the Department of Justice assist them as they sought to put in place some reforms.\xc2\xa0 But ultimately, the patterns and practice investigation will be a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s made by the Attorney General and by the appropriate officials at the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President in the Bronx spoke about how there is discrimination in law enforcement; that the statistics show that.\xc2\xa0 Does he think these kinds of investigations at DOJ -- not necessarily into Baltimore -- would be the right way to address that pattern of discrimination and could make changes?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the President was very specific about his belief that the vast majority of law enforcement officers across this country put their lives on the line to protect the communities that they are sworn to serve.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that we need to be appreciative of the commitment that the vast majority of our law enforcement officers make to doing their important work and doing it fairly, and in pursuit of justice.</p>\n<p>The President has also been clear, as he was when he spoke about this matter in the Rose Garden last week, that it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair for us to ultimately put it on the shoulders of our law enforcement officers to deal with the wide-ranging and deeply entrenched problems that plague so many economically disadvantaged communities across this country -- not just in urban communities, but in some rural communities as well.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility for all of us, not just for those in law enforcement, to spend some time thinking about what we can do to address the root causes of so many of these problems.</p>\n<p>As it relates to some instances where it does seem apparent that the law is not being implemented and enforced in a uniform way across the board, there are a variety of ways that we can take steps to address those inequities.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of what was proposed in the 21st Century Policing Task Force report.\xc2\xa0 There are some steps that can be taken to -- and have been taken in some communities to good effect -- to rebuild and strengthen the bonds of trust between local law enforcement officials and those who live in the communities where they work.</p>\n<p>But there also is, of course, a legitimate role for the Department of Justice to play in all of this, and that\'s necessarily a role that they play independent.\xc2\xa0 And as I answer these questions I\'m trying to be respectful of the independent role that they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to play in this process, because there is a place for them to use their independent perch to mandate needed changes, and they should have the opportunity to conduct those investigations, reach those conclusions, and put them forward at a time and place of their choosing.</p>\n<p>Jeff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, Iran is still holding on to the Maersk ship that it took under control and saying that it will do so until the legal dispute has been settled.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States involved either with Iran or with the Danish authorities about that legal dispute?\xc2\xa0 And do you think that Tehran is handling this situation appropriately?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, this is a situation that we continue to monitor, and it\'s principally our Department of Defense that\'s been doing that.\xc2\xa0 The Iranian authorities have suggested that the reason for the action that they took was related to a legal dispute with the company.\xc2\xa0 And there are some reports that indicate that those differences or those legal difficulties could be resolved in the next few days and the ship could be released.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t speak to the veracity of those specific reports, but I\'d refer you to the private company for an update.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does the United States think that Iran is handling this correctly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, at this point, I wouldn\'t render judgment in terms of the way that they\xe2\x80\x99re handling it.\xc2\xa0 We obviously have been watching this carefully.\xc2\xa0 There are no U.S. citizens, as far as we know, who are on the ship or otherwise involved.\xc2\xa0 But what we have been talking about more than usual in this room over the last couple of weeks is the vested U.S. interest in the free flow of commerce in this region of the world, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that these kinds of actions do start to raise those questions.\xc2\xa0 But that would explain why the United States continues to monitor the situation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, the fighting in Yemen is continuing to have civilian casualties, and aid organizations are saying they may need to stop their work there because of fuel shortages.\xc2\xa0 What more can the United States do to lead to a pause in the fighting and/or to relieve the humanitarian situation?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jeff, the first thing I\'d want to point out is that earlier today the United States did announce the release of $68 million in additional humanitarian assistance for Yemen.\xc2\xa0 We know that there are some 16 million people in that war-torn country who are in need of assistance, including as many as 300,000 newly internally displaced people.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked at great length about the dire humanitarian situation in that country.\xc2\xa0 There are pretty urgent shortages of basic necessities like food and medicine and fuel.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s having a significant impact on civilians who are essentially caught in the crossfire of that conflict.</p>\n<p>We welcome the recent statements from the Saudi foreign minister about the use of humanitarian pauses to ensure that humanitarian assistance is getting to the people who need it.\xc2\xa0 We strongly urge the coalition to urgently work with the U.N. and other humanitarian organizations on the implementation of the proposal so that those in need can get the necessary assistance.</p>\n<p>Jeff, I think you also know that Secretary of State John Kerry is arriving in Riyadh today.\xc2\xa0 And among the many things that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing with Saudi officials is the details of implementing a humanitarian pause.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the State Department for more information about the trip and about those conversations.</p>\n<p>But we\'re going to continue to make the case that given the dire humanitarian situation in that country, we believe that the implementation of these kinds of humanitarian pauses is appropriate so that international aid organizations can try to bring some relief to that situation.</p>\n<p>More broadly, we continue to understand the legitimate concerns that the Saudis have about the security situation along their southern border.\xc2\xa0 The United States has for a number of weeks now provided support in the form of logistical support and intelligence support to the coalition of countries that are acting to try to address that security situation.\xc2\xa0 However, we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s time for all sides to pursue the kind of inclusive political dialogue that\'s necessary to try to resolve these differences peacefully.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And lastly, can you give us a sense of when the next round of U.S.-Cuba talks will take place?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an update in terms of those conversations.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the United States Treasury Department issued some new regulations just yesterday about ferry service between the United States and Cuba.\xc2\xa0 That is a step -- or that\'s an indication that we\'re continuing to take steps to normalize relations between our two countries.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that a ferry service between south Florida and Cuba would provide another important opportunity to increase the people-to-people contact between the United States and Cuban people.</p>\n<p>So we obviously welcome this step, and we\'re going to continue to take these steps along the path toward normalizing relations.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have an update for you in terms of when the next round of talks is scheduled.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. concerned about the number of civilian casualties in Yemen?\xc2\xa0 The Saudis said that they moved into a new phase, but obviously airstrikes are continuing.\xc2\xa0 There seem to be daily reports of civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 And how does the administration feel about that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Michelle, we do continue to be concerned about the impact of this ongoing fighting on the civilian population in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 This is everything from the needed humanitarian assistance -- that there is a pretty dire humanitarian situation; that there are shortages of food and fuel and medicine in that country.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s having a negative impact on the livelihood of millions of innocent Yemenis, and we continue to be concerned and mindful of those ongoing needs.\xc2\xa0 And that would explain why the United States has announced additional assistance there to contribute to this broader international effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there are -- anytime you have chaos in a country like this, there are going to be concerns about innocent civilians being caught in the crossfire.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we certainly are pleased that the Saudis have indicated a willingness to scale back their military efforts, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen a corresponding response from the Houthi rebels indicating a willingness to cease their military operations and bring about the dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to try to resolve the differences between all of the parties in this conflict.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And given everything that\xe2\x80\x99s gone on there, on the water, with the U.S. ships present, Iranian ships turning away at one point, as well as the ongoing nuclear negotiations -- do you feel that Iran is still playing the same role in supporting and funding the Houthi rebels, or is there some change in that situation do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update in terms of our latest assessment about the ties between the Houthi rebels and Iran.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed concerns in the past about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Houthi rebels in a way that has had a destabilizing impact on that situation and on the broader region.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the kinds of destabilizing activities that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Iran for some time as it relates to the political situation in the Middle East.\xc2\xa0 We continue to be concerned about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I continue to make the case that that is one of the reasons that we need to place a priority on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to believe that the best way to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is through diplomacy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to pursue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to be clear, you think that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a change in how the Iranians are treated that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment for you.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past is that we know that there is material support that Iran has provided to the Houthi rebels.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have additional details about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And we heard John McCain say that the Gulf States don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a lot of support from the administration.\xc2\xa0 He said that they\xe2\x80\x99re acting on their own and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Saudis only gave an hour\xe2\x80\x99s notice before they started airstrikes in Yemen.\xc2\xa0 How would you characterize that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s how the Saudis or our Gulf partners would characterize the level of support they\xe2\x80\x99re currently receiving from the United States government.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how the U.S. is supporting the coalition in terms of providing logistical support and intelligence support to the ongoing operations there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And in fact, Secretary of State John Kerry is in Saudi Arabia today to further coordinate our efforts, particularly as it relates to the details of implementing humanitarian pauses to try to allow international aid organizations to bring much-needed supplies to the civilian population there.</p>\n<p>And as you know, next week the President has planned to bring the leaders of the GCC countries to Camp David for intensive consultations about our security cooperation with those countries.\xc2\xa0 And the United States obviously has a long history in terms of our security relationship with these countries, and that relationship has been good for the security of the people of those countries.\xc2\xa0 That relationship has also been beneficial to the security of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is committed to continuing to strengthen that relationship.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, one of the chief benefits of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is that it will have a corresponding positive impact on the security situation of our partners in the region.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Anita.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Former or retired Justice Stevens this week said that the government should compensate detainees at Gitmo, and I\'m wondering what your thoughts were about that, if you agree with him.\xc2\xa0 He specifically talked about those that were not deemed a security threat to the United States but have remained in custody for years.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Anita, you know the President has placed a priority on closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay since his first days in office.\xc2\xa0 And unfortunately, we have seen Congress erect barriers to the completion of that goal.\xc2\xa0 The President has been disappointed by that congressional activity.\xc2\xa0 The President has made the case publicly many times, he\xe2\x80\x99s made the case privately to many members of Congress directly, that continuing to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open is not at all in the national security interest of the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 It certainly is not consistent with the wise use of our government resources; that the millions of dollars that are expended to keep that facility open and operating is not a wise use of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n<p>So whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a fiscal reason, or a reason that\xe2\x80\x99s directly related to the core national security interest of the United States, the President believes and is continuing to pursue the responsible closing of that facility.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some of the news reports about Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 remarks, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t read the specific text and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific reaction to his comments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if the President thinks that they should be compensated?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s basically what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying, that they should have some --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the substance of his remarks, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a comment on them.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Pam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I know this came up once before, but can you explain why the President chose Nike as a site to advance his trade initiatives?\xc2\xa0 Critics say it\xe2\x80\x99s a company that\xe2\x80\x99s gotten enormously profitable by producing -- sending jobs offshore, not employing Americans, and using sweatshops.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to Nike for the specific criticisms that you have outlined there.\xc2\xa0 I\'m confident they would be happy to be in a position to explain their record to you on these issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously have more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip as he travels out west later this week.\xc2\xa0 What I can just say as a general matter is that the President is looking forward to visiting the Nike headquarters and using it to illustrate how a responsible trade agreement that includes enforceable labor and environmental standards would strongly benefit middle-class families and the American economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President is pursing that kind of agreement with a dozen or so countries in the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And we are trying to work in bipartisan fashion to pass trade promotion authority legislation that would make it easier to reach that agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to work to build bipartisan support for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Critics also say that those enforceable labor and environmental standards are the same ones that are in previous trade agreements, and a government study said that they had not really changed conditions on the ground for workers.\xc2\xa0 What assurances are there that they will be more enforceable than the past agreements?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The key difference here is that the provisions that are contemplated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership are provisions that would actually be enforceable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So to take NAFTA, for example, an agreement that has previously been cited by critics of this potential trade agreement.\xc2\xa0 In NAFTA, efforts to raise labor and environmental standards essentially included in letters that were on the sidelines of the agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the way that trade promotion authority legislation has been worked out and what the President envisions for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is to ensure that those labor and environmental provisions are actually written into the text of the agreement to make sure that they can be enforced.\xc2\xa0 And again, that\xe2\x80\x99s indicative of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ensuring that we are maximizing the opportunity that exists for the American economy and, most importantly, for American middle-class families when it comes to the terms of this agreement.</p>\n<p>And the view of the President is that if the United States is not the one that is engaging in this economically dynamic region of the world, that we are essentially ceding ground to China.\xc2\xa0 And China will most assuredly try to write rules of the road that further disadvantage American companies who are trying to do business in this region of the world.\xc2\xa0 At a minimum, we know they would lock in the current low-level -- or the low labor standards that are in place.\xc2\xa0 We know that they would seek to lock in the low environmental standards in place, because they know that gives them an advantage to the Chinese business interests that capitalize on those low standards.</p>\n<p>What the President envisions is going in and reaching an agreement that would actually raise those standards, essentially leveling the playing field.\xc2\xa0 And the President continues to be confident that if American businesses and American workers have a level playing field in which to compete, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to perform very well.</p>\n<p>Kevin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, thanks.\xc2\xa0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to bring a test vote on the floor tomorrow on Iran.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m curious how the President feels about that.\xc2\xa0 Does he think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan effort?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if it reflects the bipartisan compromise that emerged from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in which Democrats and Republicans serving that committee unanimously supported the legislation, we\xe2\x80\x99ve already indicated that that\xe2\x80\x99s legislation that the President would be willing to sign.\xc2\xa0 But again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what happens on the floor.</p>\n<p>There have been a wide range of amendments that have been offered, or at least publicly discussed.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed concerns about some of them, because they would either undermine the fundamental unanimous compromise that was reached in the committee, or they would interfere with our ability to continue the negotiations or implement a final agreement.</p>\n<p>So as long as amendments that don\xe2\x80\x99t violate those two criteria are not tacked on to the bill at the last minute, that I would envision that what would emerge from this bipartisan process is legislation that the President could sign.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to turn to Iran for just a second.\xc2\xa0 Supreme Leader Khamenei saying that -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting now -- \xe2\x80\x9cOver the last couple days, at least two U.S. officials have threatened Iran with military action if the talks fail.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Any response to that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which specific U.S. officials are referred to in those reports.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that it continues to be the view of the President that, by far, the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is engaging in diplomacy with the rest of the international community.\xc2\xa0 And the framework political agreement that was reached in early April was an agreement that would shut down every pathway that Iran has to a nuclear weapon, and ensure that Iran cooperates with the most intrusive set of inspections that have been imposed on a country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is the best way for us to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 It will not, however, address the long list of concerns we have about Iranian behavior in other areas.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely because of that concern about Iranian behavior in a wide variety of other areas that we have made preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon a top priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible then that there was a threat, military action against Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what those reports refer to, to be honest with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, lastly, I want to ask you about Texas.\xc2\xa0 Any new news out of the allegation that ISIS may have been involved with the attack in Texas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t have an updated intelligence assessment to share.\xc2\xa0 These facts are still being reviewed by our intelligence community.\xc2\xa0 But let me see if I can give you a better sense about what exactly they\'re looking at.</p>\n<p>What the intelligence community is trying to do is they\'re trying to investigate specifically ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s claim of responsibility, and that involves more than just authenticating that the claim published yesterday originated from ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The analysts want to review whether the claim is accurate.\xc2\xa0 And if so, at what level ISIL may have known or potentially even sanctioned this attempted attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s less about just confirming the authenticity of a specific Twitter feed, and more about examining what actually was said and who was responsible for communicating that information both the public but also to the two individuals that carried out the attack, if they, in fact, communicated with the individuals who carried out the attack.</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to review here.\xc2\xa0 And that work has not yet been completed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that same topic.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve reported that intelligence services did have the two gunmen under surveillance, but that they were not high priority.\xc2\xa0 Do the various intelligence services not have the resources to monitor dangerous individuals like this?\xc2\xa0 And shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, the President has made countering violent extremism a priority.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that earlier this year he convened a meeting of top government officials and community leaders and local officials all across the country.\xc2\xa0 And this included representation from both our law enforcement and our intelligence community to talk about this issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is something that this administration is keenly aware of, and we\'re aware of the threat that it poses to the American people.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are any number of examples of arrests that were made by law enforcement officials of individuals who either sought to travel to Syria or the region to take up arms alongside ISIL, or individuals who expressed a desire to carry out acts of violence in this country in the name of ISIL.\xc2\xa0 So there is a robust response to this, both in terms of trying to prevent individuals from being radicalized in the first place; but if they are, we have mobilized extensive law enforcement and intelligence resources to protect the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are those resources sufficient?\xc2\xa0 The fact that these guys were being monitored but not high priority suggests that maybe the resources are not sufficient.\xc2\xa0 You have a lot of people apparently being monitored.\xc2\xa0 Here are two that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to do anything, and they did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a lot of challenges associated with trying to root out and prevent essentially lone-wolf attacks.\xc2\xa0 And again, based on what we know now -- and there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot more that we have to learn -- this is consistent with what has previously been described as a lone wolf attack; that essentially you have two individuals that don\'t appear to be part of a broader conspiracy.\xc2\xa0 And identifying those individuals and keeping tabs on them is difficult work.\xc2\xa0 And even in an environment where resources were unlimited -- and of course, we\'re not in that environment, but even if we were operating in an environment where resources were unlimited, this is the kind of thing that would be very difficult to deter and prevent.</p>\n<p>One of the things that we can do, however, is make sure that we are clearly communicating with local law enforcement across jurisdictions to make sure that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared.\xc2\xa0 And when you have an event like the one that we saw outside Dallas over the weekend that we know is likely to attract a lot of attention, we can make sure that we\'re communicating with local law enforcement and beefing up security resources to keep everybody who is participating in that event safe.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly what happened.</p>\n<p>Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Nedra\xe2\x80\x99s question on immigration.\xc2\xa0 So if the White House\xe2\x80\x99s position that the President did all he could do within his powers as President on this issue is true, and Hillary Clinton is now saying that what she would do -- using her executive powers, if she were elected President -- to go further, she is suggesting that she would extend deferred action to the parents of the DREAMers, for example.\xc2\xa0 Given what you\xe2\x80\x99ve said, your suggestion is that what Hillary is proposing is beyond the powers of the presidency, essentially not legal.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not a judge and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to law school, so I\'m not going to be in a position to render a legal opinion about the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you did say that the White House position remains that the President did all he can do within his legal power.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely.\xc2\xa0 And we went to the extraordinary step of releasing that Office of Legal Counsel opinion to buttress the legal argument that we were making in support of the executive action that the President announced.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And now Hillary Clinton is saying that she would go further.\xc2\xa0 So she is effectively, in the view of the White House, proposing to go beyond the bounds of what is legally permissible by the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\'ll let Secretary Clinton and her campaign describe exactly what steps they envision taking, and I\'ll allow them to make the case about why it\'s legal.\xc2\xa0 I think we certainly were heartened by the fact that Secretary Clinton so forcefully supported the President\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions.\xc2\xa0 And the other thing that she said that also happens to be true is that the best way for us to solve this problem is for Congress to act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m not asking for a legal pronouncement.\xc2\xa0 It just seems like an obvious statement.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said the White House believes that the President went as far as he could.\xc2\xa0 Now Hillary Clinton is saying she will go further.\xc2\xa0 There seems to be a conflict.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, there may be a legal explanation that they have that you should ask them about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And then one other question regarding Hillary Clinton.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you were watching the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing today.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I was paying rapt attention.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We heard from the senior official responsible for Freedom of Information Act requests and the like say that Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s use -- well, that the use of private email for public purposes, as Hillary Clinton did, is clearly beyond the bounds of what is permissible.\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see who the -- I didn\'t see who the official was.\xc2\xa0 I was joking when I said I was paying rapt attention.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 So maybe I missed something good, but I didn\'t actually see it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m really disappointed.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It was Joyce Bare, just to be clear, the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Administration.\xc2\xa0 But the position was simply that the use of private email for official business is -- the message is loud and clear that that is not acceptable; it is not acceptable to use private email for official business.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have talked about the kind of guidance that we give to administration officials, and particularly to White House officials in terms of the use of email.\xc2\xa0 And the guidance that we receive is to use public email or our government email when carrying out official activities.\xc2\xa0 But again --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you would agree, though, that the use of private email for official business is clearly not acceptable?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is a flashback to a couple of months ago.\xc2\xa0 But again, the guidance that we continue to give administration officials is that they should use their government email when they are conducting the official business of the United States government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and then one other question on an entirely different subject.\xc2\xa0 The family of Amir Hekmati -- again, one of the Americans who is in prison now in Iran, and, of course, a Marine veteran who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan -- his family is now asking that the Red Cross be able to visit him and detailing some of his treatment, including 17 months of the more than three years he has been imprisoned, 17 months of solitary confinement, the use of tasers on his kidneys, sleep deprivation, and a whole host of other things -- terrible treatment.\xc2\xa0 They\'re asking that the Red Cross be allowed to see him.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration echo that request?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jon, as you know, the Vice President over the weekend, when he was traveling in the Detroit area, had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Hekmati\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xc2\xa0 And I understand that they had a pretty long conversation about both the concerns that the Hekmati family understandably has about the treatment of their loved one.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President also had the opportunity to detail for them the lengths that this administration has gone to to try to secure the release of him and the other Americans who we believe are being unjustly held inside of Iran.\xc2\xa0 Those efforts continue.</p>\n<p>And I don\'t have -- obviously, one of the reasons that we would like to see those individuals released is that we are concerned about the kind of treatment that they may be subjected to while they\'re imprisoned.\xc2\xa0 And so our concerns about this are concerns that we share with the family.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so maybe you can just get back to me, but, again, this is an American citizen, a Marine veteran.\xc2\xa0 And the family is asking that the Red Cross be able to visit him.\xc2\xa0 They\'re concerned about his health.\xc2\xa0 And if you can get back whether the White House agrees with that and would echo that --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, I will get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just had a follow-up about Nike.\xc2\xa0 What was it about Nike that prompted you to schedule the event there?\xc2\xa0 I still don\'t -- you still haven\xe2\x80\x99t really explained that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know.\xc2\xa0 We also still haven\xe2\x80\x99t been to the Nike headquarters yet.\xc2\xa0 So what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is once we have the event on Friday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be -- it will become much clearer to all of you why this is a useful illustration of the significant economic benefits associated -- economic benefits for the American people and for middle-class families associated with finalizing and implementing a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\'t want to say anything good about Nike until Friday?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, my guess is, is that there is an office somewhere -- probably in Beaverton, Oregon -- with very well-compensated, extremely skilled communications professionals who could say all kinds of nice things about Nike.\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure that there are lots of nice things for them to say.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m asking what you would say.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m saying is that on Friday, when the President appears in Nike, we will have a more specific, robust discussion about why exactly the President is there.\xc2\xa0 Something I look forward to.\xc2\xa0 I hope you do, too.</p>\n<p>Jordan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the counter violent extremism summit, and I\'m wondering if the White House is planning any additional actions or programs to address this problem in the wake of the Texas attack.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, part of the goal of the summit was to try to amass best practices -- so to identify what some communities across the country are doing to prevent certain individuals from being radicalized, and applying those lessons and those best practices in other communities as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there is an important facilitating role that the administration can play through the Department of Justice and through other places to help other communities meet this challenge.\xc2\xa0 So this is ongoing work and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we continue to be very focused on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the defense bill that\xe2\x80\x99s in the House, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tussle over immigration language that\xe2\x80\x99s in that bill.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering if the White House is concerned that another must-pass piece of legislation is being held up by an immigration fight?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Which bill are you referring to?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The defense authorization bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, we have indicated a pretty long list of concerns with a variety of provisions included in the defense authorization bill, including the continued reliance on this slush fund to fund basic national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a long list of concerns.</p>\n<p>I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I\'m aware specifically of the immigration provision that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, but it would be consistent with the kind of actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Republicans take in the past to try to interfere with must-pass legislation by attaching unrelated controversial ideological riders.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I want to go back to issues of trade, kind of more broadly speaking.\xc2\xa0 Cities like Baltimore say that trade affected the city by many industries leaving and going to another country, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you have poverty in the inner cities, particularly Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s Fell\xe2\x80\x99s Point and other industries that left because of local trade.\xc2\xa0 What are the safeguards the President has in his proposal, his push, when it comes to protecting many of these urban cities to prevent the kind of cycles of poverty that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Baltimore and other places like Ferguson and some other places that have been hit?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, the argument that the President has made is that to not try to open up opportunities for American businesses and overseas markets essentially locks in that status quo.\xc2\xa0 That right now, we have seen companies take advantage of some unfair labor standards in other countries to gain in a competitive advantage over American companies.\xc2\xa0 And that did prompt a number of companies to leave the United States in pursuit of more lax labor standards and essentially cheaper labor.\xc2\xa0 And that did have an impact on communities large and small all across the country.</p>\n<p>What the President basically suggests is that if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the impact, then what you should support -- and what the President supports -- is raising labor and environmental standards around the globe.\xc2\xa0 That if we raise those labor standards, essentially what we do is we level the playing field, and no longer will companies have an incentive to ship jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 In fact, there now would be a variety of incentives for those companies to consider relocating back to America.\xc2\xa0 Because we know that America has a bunch of other built-in advantages -- everything from the best colleges in the world to the most innovative economy in terms of people being able to take good ideas to market and to capitalize them quickly.\xc2\xa0 We know that America has the most ambitious entrepreneurs, the hardest-working people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So if you\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about the impact that previous trade agreements have had on communities, then what you want to do is you want to try to level that playing field.\xc2\xa0 And the way that we level that playing field is by entering into the kinds of trade agreements that include enforceable labor provisions, because if we don\xe2\x80\x99t, what we know will happen is we know that China will step in.\xc2\xa0 And if China has an opportunity to step in, they will either lock in those low labor standards or seek to lower them even further.\xc2\xa0 That will put American businesses at an even bigger disadvantage and create an even bigger incentive for companies that are currently located in the United States to try to go and benefit from those low labor standards and that even cheaper labor.</p>\n<p>So if we want to sort of stop this cycle that you referred to, one important step that we can take is actually give more U.S. businesses the opportunity to do business overseas.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to ask one more on poverty and the situation in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 The magnifying glass has been on Baltimore now, particularly the areas where Freddie Gray was killed -- the Penn and North area.\xc2\xa0 What is this administration prepared to do when it comes to impoverished communities like that area, West Baltimore and -- station?\xc2\xa0 Magnifying glasses on it, people are now saying, oh my God, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that it\xe2\x80\x99s been there all along.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your Education Secretary there, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your Labor Secretary there.\xc2\xa0 What is this administration prepared to do in the last remaining years or months that you have to try to begin to change the ties in your base, your core demographic who voted for this President?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think the first thing I\xe2\x80\x99d point out is that the pretty dire economic situation in some of those neighborhoods in Baltimore may be new to some people but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not new to this President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that just about two years ago, the President traveled to Baltimore and spent some time at a school that had a very successful kindergarten program.\xc2\xa0 He spent some time at a local business that was capitalizing on creating jobs at the port.\xc2\xa0 And he also traveled to the Center for Urban Families, which is a nonprofit organization that was geared toward supporting principally young men of color, but those communities of color as they sought to get job-training skills that will allow them to get a job and provide for their families.</p>\n<p>So the President is keenly aware of so many of these challenges, particularly as they relate directly to Baltimore, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been focused on trying to address these challenges even when other people haven\'t been paying attention.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I can tell you that whether it\'s trying to implement the recommendations of the 21st Century Policing Task Force, or trying to pass criminal justice reform, or trying to get early childhood education for every child in America, or ensuring that hardworking college students can have access to two years of free community college -- that there are a number of steps that we can take.\xc2\xa0 A handful of them are things that we feel like there may be an opportunity for us to capitalize on some bipartisan agreement to make progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But many of the things that I\'ve listed are things that Republicans have steadfastly opposed.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And when I say Republicans, I actually just mean Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 Some of these proposals, like free community college and high-quality early childhood education for every child in America, are the kinds of things that Republicans across the country support.\xc2\xa0 But unfortunately, for political reasons, there are some Republicans in Congress who have effectively blocked these kinds of efforts that we know would make a material difference in the lives of men and women in economically disadvantaged communities all across the country -- both in urban settings like in Baltimore, but also in rural settings where you see Americans who are locked in a similar cycle of poverty.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last question.\xc2\xa0 Is the President thinking about possibly going?\xc2\xa0 Is there a chance that he will go to Baltimore?\xc2\xa0 The situation is calm now.\xc2\xa0 Will he be going?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any updates in terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t anticipate him traveling to Baltimore in the near future.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President himself has indicated a desire to go back there at some point.</p>\n<p>Drew.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to Yemen -- there\xe2\x80\x99s now a serious humanitarian crisis.\xc2\xa0 The Houthis haven\'t been dislodged, and you see cross-border violence, which you never saw before.\xc2\xa0 Was the Saudi air campaign a bad idea?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Drew, I think the Saudis launched an air campaign in conjunction with some of their allies in the region because they have concerns about the security situation along their southern border, and the cross-border fire by the Houthis that you cited I think is a pretty good illustration of the concerns that they have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, in response to those concerns, the United States has offered our support to the Saudis and to the broader coalition in the form of logistical support and some intelligence assets that we can use to benefit their efforts.</p>\n<p>But what we have told the Saudis is the same thing that we\'ve said publicly, which is that the only resolution here is a resolution that starts with all parties engaging in diplomatic negotiations to try to resolve their differences.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve been gratified that the Saudis have indicated a willingness to deescalate their military campaign, but we haven\'t seen a corresponding willingness on the part of the Houthis.\xc2\xa0 If anything, I think we\'ve seen them continue to accelerate their actions.\xc2\xa0 And that is a source of some concern, and it is certainly counterproductive to the broader efforts to try to stabilize the turmoil inside of Yemen, but just as importantly -- and in some ways, more urgently -- address the dire humanitarian need in that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But would you agree that Yemen is no closer today to stability or prosperity than it was when the Saudi airstrikes began?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the principal cause of the instability that we\'ve seen there has been the Houthi rebels that have engaged in essentially unceasing violence there for the last several months in a way that has destabilized the central government pretty dramatically, and thrown the nation into even more turmoil and chaos than they previously experienced.</p>\n<p>And the Saudi and the Gulf coast -- or the GCC coalition I think has responded to the understandable concerns that they have about the possibility of that violence and chaos spreading into their countries.\xc2\xa0 And again, the clearest illustration that we\'ve seen of their concerns just occurred in the last 24 hours when there are reports that some of the Houthi rebels have actually fired shots into Saudi territory.</p>\n<p>So that\'s why the United States, again, has dedicated additional resources to try to address the humanitarian need that\'s evident to anybody who looks in that country.\xc2\xa0 It\'s why we\'ve continued to support this Saudi-GCC coalition through the provision of intelligence resources and logistical support.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s also why we continue to urge all sides to engage in this U.N.-led -- or at least U.N.-facilitated process to try to bring about a political resolution to the conflict.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a final question on Iraq.\xc2\xa0 In the talks with Mr. Barzani, was there any discussion of a timetable for an assault on Mosul?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 If there was, it\xe2\x80\x99s not something I\xe2\x80\x99d be able to read out from here.</p>\n<p>Angela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh, back to trade.\xc2\xa0 The Senate has said that trade will come up next after they finish the Iran bill.\xc2\xa0 And you said on Monday that the President will be personally involved this week with working on cajoling Congress to do what he wants.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on what sort of interaction there\xe2\x80\x99s been between the White House generally and Leader McConnell on this?\xc2\xa0 And then whether the President has himself talked with Leader McConnell or other members of Congress this week on the trade issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the President has been engaged on this and continues to be engaged in making the case to Democrats and Republicans about the wisdom of pursuing this approach.\xc2\xa0 And those efforts have continued this week, but I don\'t have any details to share with you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Efforts including individual phone calls?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Including conversations that the President has had with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any specifics?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t have any specifics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Byron.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a deadline to form a government -- and it looks like he may.\xc2\xa0 Will the White House invite him here for a meeting given all the drama around the Iran talks after he forms a government?\xc2\xa0 I know you said you didn\'t want to interfere in the election beforehand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The thing that we have indicated -- Byron, you\'re right -- is that the President did not envision a meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu prior to the completion of the government formation process.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, the President was just as clear that that would have no impact on the deep and intensive security cooperation between our two countries.</p>\n<p>We know that the kind of security support that the United States provides to Israel is critical to the safety and well-being of the Israeli people.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a venture in which we are deeply invested, and one that will continue.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Netanyahu has observed himself that the level of security cooperation between Israel and the United States under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch has been unprecedented.\xc2\xa0 And the unprecedented security cooperation continues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I don\'t have any additional meetings to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if and when a new government is formed by Prime Minister Netanyahu, I would expect that the United States will continue to work closely with that government, and the Obama administration will continue to be closely in touch with them on a wide range of issues, but most importantly our close security relationship.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A second foreign leader question is that the Armenian President is in D.C. this week.\xc2\xa0 Why didn\'t the President meet with him?\xc2\xa0 And did it have anything to do with the ongoing issue of the use of word \xe2\x80\x9cgenocide\xe2\x80\x9d?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think it was more directly related to the President\xe2\x80\x99s rather busy schedule this week.\xc2\xa0 But I do know that the Vice President will be attending the prayer service that\'s scheduled for later this week, where the Armenian President will also be in attendance, as well, I understand.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was a meeting requested between the two Presidents?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware -- I actually don\'t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Chris.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Civil libertarians are raising some questions after these reports about drones over Baltimore during a time of unrest following Freddie Gray\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can articulate what the administration policy is on this type of surveillance, especially given the concerns that they often catch a lot of people who are doing absolutely nothing wrong in situations like this.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chris, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall that in the last several months the FAA has put out some basic regulations regarding the private use of unmanned aerial vehicles -- drones.\xc2\xa0 And so you could go to the FAA for the details of those regulations.</p>\n<p>Obviously, those kinds of regulations apply differently when it comes to law enforcement assets.\xc2\xa0 But for questions about law enforcement, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the relevant law enforcement officials.\xc2\xa0 In this case, I think that would be the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does the administration have a policy on that?\xc2\xa0 Is there -- are there conversations about it?\xc2\xa0 Or is this a situation where essentially the technology has -- or I guess the policy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t caught up with the technology?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there is a policy, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one that, again, if it relates to the use of law enforcement assets, then I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to law enforcement officials who can talk to you about those policies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to ask you quickly about the meeting, which may still be going on, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure, between Governor Scott and Sylvia Burwell.\xc2\xa0 And as you well know, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming and pushing for a billion dollars in federal aid for Florida hospitals.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s message to Governor Scott?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there has been a range of issues of concern about the willingness of Governor Scott and his administration to work with the administration to maximize the health care benefits for the people in his state.</p>\n<p>And I asked about this right before I walked out here actually, and the meeting was still ongoing when I walked out here.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say anything further until the meeting is concluded, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if we can get you some more information about how that meeting went.</p>\n<p>All right, let\xe2\x80\x99s move around.\xc2\xa0 Fred.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just this week, Governor Fallon in Oklahoma, a Republican governor, signed a bill on sentencing, mandatory sentencing reform.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something you just mentioned in answer to a previous question.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about it before.\xc2\xa0 There is a bill -- Mike Lee, Dick Durbin -- that they\'re pushing from the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Is this something -- given that there is pretty strong bipartisanship out there for criminal justice reform, is this something that the President might get out in front on in terms of there is an existing framework there with the Lee-Durbin bill that you could speak out on?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Fred, this is something that the President has had -- has discussed with members of Congress from both parties on a couple of occasions.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall a month or two ago, the President did convene a meeting with Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate in the Cabinet Room, I believe, to discuss this very issue.</p>\n<p>This is something that the President believes would be important to addressing some of the concerns about inequities in the way that the law is enforced.\xc2\xa0 And the President I think has been gratified that both Democrats and Republicans recognize that this is a priority, and that putting in place these kinds of reforms would be good for the country.\xc2\xa0 And the President is certainly interested and willing to work with Democrats or Republicans -- anybody on either side of the aisle -- that understands why this is an important step for our country to take.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do you have any thoughts on the legislation that was signed this week out in Oklahoma?\xc2\xa0 Have you seen anything on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with it, so I\xe2\x80\x99d reserve comment on it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, on former Speaker Wright, does the White House have any comment on his passing?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 On -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Former Speaker Jim Wright, is there any White House comment as of yet on his passing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I was not aware that he had passed away, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll check that out and get back to you.</p>\n<p>Susan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On April\xe2\x80\x99s question earlier, there have been reports out that the CBC -- that President Obama is making a pitch to the CBC members to pass trade and get it across the finish line in the House, at least.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that is a tough sell right now considering the Baltimore issue and the loss of manufacturing jobs in blighted urban areas around the country, and the lawmakers that represent them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think the response that I shared with April I think is relevant here, which is for those members of Congress who are particularly concerned about the impact that previous trade agreements have had on their communities, that\'s all the more reason that they should be supportive of the kind of Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that the President envisions.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simple:\xc2\xa0 That failing to act in this way would essentially lock in the status quo.\xc2\xa0 That those companies that have left seeking cheap labor are going to come back, or at least they would consider coming back if we can succeed in leveling the playing field.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But right now they have a built-in incentive to capitalize on cheap labor in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And if the United States disengages, I think what we\'re much more likely to see is erosion in those already low labor standards in a way that would only give companies a greater incentive to invest in places other than the United States.\xc2\xa0 But that if we can succeed in raising labor standards around the world, particularly in the most dynamic -- economically dynamic region of the world, then what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do is we will not only give American businesses located in this country an opportunity to compete on a level playing field, we\xe2\x80\x99ll actually give businesses around the world an incentive to consider relocating in the United States,</p>\n<p>Right now, the advantage that exists in some countries because of cheap labor standards, or access to cheap labor, outweighs -- at least in their calculation -- the other opportunities -- or other benefits that are available to them inside the United States.\xc2\xa0 This is things like a stable legal system where they can rely on the ability of their company to do business here, access to the greatest colleges and best-educated workforce in the world, access to the kind of innovation in research and development that is going on in this country.\xc2\xa0 That if we can level the playing field, more businesses are going to consider those benefits here in the United States and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to give them a good reason -- or good reasons to further invest here in this country.</p>\n<p>So I believe that our case for why Democrats should support a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement along the lines of what the President has described is strongest among those who are concerned about the impact that previous trade agreements with unenforceable labor and environmental provisions have about the impact that they\xe2\x80\x99ve had on their communities.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a big trade deficit, though, with South Korea.\xc2\xa0 The President renegotiated that when he came into office, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still a huge trade deficit there with them, and there was a report yesterday that the trade deficit is at all-time high overall.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if they can sweeten the deal for Congressional Black Caucus members by saying, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to provide new initiatives.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in the works to attract businesses to these blighted communities that are suffering that the President has talked so much about in the last couple weeks?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as it relates to the trade numbers that were announced yesterday, there are a couple of key facts that are worth being mindful of.\xc2\xa0 The first is that these were numbers that were taken from March, I believe, and this was the month after the labor standoff at the West Coast ports was resolved, which means that there was an influx of ships that were waiting to be offloaded in those ports and that would account for some of the increase in imports that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>The other thing that analysts have indicated is that the current strong value of the dollar has had an impact on our trading relationships.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But more generally, what the President does envision is doing everything that we can to promote investment inside the United States and in all of the communities inside the United States.\xc2\xa0 There are a variety of programs that I\'m sure that the Commerce Department and the Small Business Administration could talk to you about, about trying to focus investment in those areas where it\'s needed most.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is anytime that a company is considering moving more business into the United States, that significantly increases the economic potential for communities all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s what we\'re focused on, and we know that that contributes significantly to our GDP and to job creation.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why the President has been focused on increasing our exports since the earliest days that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in office.</p>\n<p>Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one follow-up on Chris\xe2\x80\x99s question about surveillance in Baltimore.\xc2\xa0 You responded about FAA and private drones.\xc2\xa0 If the Cessna that was flying over was acting on behalf of both local and federal law enforcement, that would violate potentially the 14th and 4th Amendments, respectively.\xc2\xa0 The White House doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a position on whether that\'s an appropriate surveillance of thousands of people simultaneously?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, for those kinds of questions I\'d refer you to law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t think that there\xe2\x80\x99s a potential damage here done if thousands of people are surveilled by aerial forces?\xc2\xa0 That\'s not something the White House is concerned about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jared, I\'m not sure that\'s exactly what happened.\xc2\xa0 But in order to confirm for you what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, I\'d refer you to law enforcement who can give you some facts here, and that we can -- you don\'t have to spend as much time conjecturing; you can actually deal in facts.\xc2\xa0 And you can talk to them about that.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House think that this isn\'t what happened?\xc2\xa0 Is that -- I\'m just trying to understand.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to move on.</p>\n<p>Laura.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up on Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 Will the President be ready to do an executive order to close Guantanamo?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Laura, the President has indicated a willingness to use as much of his executive authority as he can to try to take the steps that he believes are consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and that\'s closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 He does not believe that the millions of dollars that are expended every year to keep that prison open is a good use of taxpayer resources.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\'s counterproductive.</p>\n<p>And unfortunately, we have not seen cooperation from Congress in this regard.\xc2\xa0 In fact, what we have seen is we\'ve seen members of Congress repeatedly go to great lengths to try to prevent the closure of the prison in Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been the source of a lot of disappointment to the President, but it has not prevented him from continuing to push his team to try to take -- to go as far as we can to reduce the population there and to ultimately get to a place where we can close that prison.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in Boston, the trial is coming to an end.\xc2\xa0 The jury will decide death or life sentence for Tsarnaev.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view on it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously jury deliberations are ongoing, and so I wouldn\'t want to weigh in on it at this point.</p>\n<p>Connie, I\'ll give you the last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 How closely is the President watching the British elections today?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any message to the British people?\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned that any of the issues that the U.S. and the U.K. work on might be --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned to JC yesterday, I\'m going to reserve comment on the elections because I don\'t want to be in a position of even leaving you with the impression that we\'re favoring one side or the other.\xc2\xa0 The President is, of course, monitoring the results of the election -- or is monitoring the election and awaiting the results, because this is an election that\'s taking place in a country with whom we have a special relationship, one of our closest allies.\xc2\xa0 And I am confident that that strong alliance and that special relationship will endure regardless of who the next British Prime Minister is; that the depth of that relationship is so strong that it will continue.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can I say polls close very soon.\xc2\xa0 And the Brits, unlike us, don\'t campaign on Election Day.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Interesting.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Save a lot of money, I guess.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, everybody go look for your British exit poll results.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:24 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
