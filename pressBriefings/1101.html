EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hello, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Back by popular demand, because we\'re grooming him to be my successor, we have the Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood, who will talk to you again about an unfortunate situation where, because of a refusal of Congress to compromise and do something it has done without any problem 20 times in the past how many years -- five years, seven years -- there are now 70,000 Americans out of work.\xc2\xa0 At a time when we should be creating jobs, growing the economy, decisions by Congress are throwing people off the job.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I give you the Secretary of Transportation, Ray LaHood.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, good noontime, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I think all of you in this room know that the last thing the administration wants is a Republican to be their spokesman, so I\'m not auditioning for Jay\'s job, okay.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When it comes to creating jobs, members of Congress give a lot of great speeches.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve heard a lot of great speeches from members of Congress about creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 They talk the talk, but they have not walked the walk.\xc2\xa0 Their speeches ring very hollow to 4,000 FAA employees who are furloughed.\xc2\xa0 Their speeches about jobs ring very hollow to 70,000 construction workers who are not working, right in the middle of the construction season, on construction projects all over America. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was at one of those construction sites a few days ago at LaGuardia Airport, and I met with these unemployed construction workers.\xc2\xa0 They\'re ready to go to work.\xc2\xa0 They\'re ready to complete the work taking down the tower at LaGuardia.\xc2\xa0 And there are construction workers all over America that are ready to go to work.\xc2\xa0 This is their season.\xc2\xa0 This is the time when they make their money for their families so they can pay their house payments, they can buy food, they can make their car payments.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And for members of Congress to give speeches about jobs and then go on their vacations while construction workers have vacated their jobs rings very hollow.\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress could easily have put 74,000 construction workers and FAA employees back to work.\xc2\xa0 But instead, they went on vacation.\xc2\xa0 Congress turned a blind eye to these workers and their families.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The shutdown of the FAA is now in its 12th day.\xc2\xa0 With members of Congress on vacation, this means they are leaving these 74,000 workers without a paycheck, without an ability to pay their mortgages, to pay their rent, to make their car payments, to take their own families on vacation for at least six weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Airport construction projects around the country worth $11 billion are sitting idle.\xc2\xa0 And as I said, we\'re smack-dab in the middle of the construction season.\xc2\xa0 This is no way to run the best and the safest aviation system in the world, and it\'s no way to get America\'s economy moving again.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to just say, parenthetically, in addition to the $11 billion worth of construction projects, $1 billion in uncollected taxes will not go to the federal treasury.\xc2\xa0 Now, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard all the great speeches on debt and deficit for the last how many weeks about how everybody is concerned about debt and deficit.\xc2\xa0 Well, the way to tackle part of the debt and deficit is to have this $1 billion in taxes collected, which it won\xe2\x80\x99t be. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to come back, resolve their differences, compromise, and put our friends and neighbors and colleagues back to work.\xc2\xa0 They should not leave 74,000 people hanging out there, without jobs, without a paycheck, until September.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, you said -- you noted you were a Republican member of Congress, and Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office, one of your former colleagues, said today they\xe2\x80\x99re ready for a deal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a Democrat, it\xe2\x80\x99s Jay Rockefeller in the Senate who\xe2\x80\x99s blocking this.\xc2\xa0 So why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President gotten on the phone to him and figured this out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jay talk about what the President does or does not do.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to them for the last two weeks, since this started.\xc2\xa0 And one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve told them, which they know, is this is the thing that really makes the public mad, that Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t do their job.\xc2\xa0 When ordinary citizens around the country hear that their friends and neighbors ought to be working on a construction site at an airport and they\xe2\x80\x99re not because Congress couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do their work -- this is what infuriates the American people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress should have passed a clean bill, could have passed a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 I urged them to pass a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 They can still do it.\xc2\xa0 Congress can still do it.\xc2\xa0 The adjournment resolutions that they have passed allows them to come back every four days in the House and pass legislation.\xc2\xa0 They could do it.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking Congress to come back and do for the American people what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about:\xc2\xa0 Put 75,000 people back to work in good-paying jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what Congress should do.\xc2\xa0 Take a little detour from their own vacation, come back to Washington, and pass a clean bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Republicans are very clear that they will not change anything to do with union organizing, what Senate Democrats see as union busting and basically a payoff to Delta Airlines.\xc2\xa0 What do you say to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 What I say is, do what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done on 20 other occasions, in some instances in very short period of time: Pass a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done on 20 other occasions. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look it, when the House passes a bill and the Senate passes a bill, there are always these disputes.\xc2\xa0 There are always these controversies.\xc2\xa0 On 20 other occasions, Congress did not hold hostage 75,000 people.\xc2\xa0 What they did is they passed a clean bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Congress could come back -- they could come back today or tomorrow or next Monday or next Tuesday -- pass a clean bill, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve done on 20 other occasions.\xc2\xa0 People go back to work.\xc2\xa0 They resolve their disputes, whatever they are, whatever the disputes are.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the way legislation gets passed.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s gets passed by compromise.\xc2\xa0 It gets passed by people sitting down at a table, working out their differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a long -- you heard me say this last time -- a long, rich history in this town of compromise.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 Compromise.\xc2\xa0 Pass a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 Work out your differences.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary LaHood, is there anything that the President can do?\xc2\xa0 Is there any executive action that the President can do, any emergency action?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask Jay about that.\xc2\xa0 You know what, I\xe2\x80\x99m working hard right now --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know, as Secretary, of any emergency action that can be taken to remedy this situation or to help all these people who are out of work in the interim?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Jay answer that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, can I follow on my question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me take a question from Mike, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is specific action that analysts have told our transportation reporters, which is that the President can grant you, the Secretary, the authority to shift funds, and that would help out the FAA.\xc2\xa0 Is that something that you would do or would consider doing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 What I want done --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 What I want done is what Congress has done on 20 other occasions:\xc2\xa0 Send 75,000 people back to work, pass a clean bill, and work out your differences.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done it.\xc2\xa0 They know how to do it.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve done it in a short period of time.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what they need to do.\xc2\xa0 This is not fair to these people.\xc2\xa0 These are people that work hard.\xc2\xa0 These are people that are right in the middle of the construction season.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would the President be willing to give you that authority?\xc2\xa0 Could you or Jay answer that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will take that --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Let me just get a couple other people, okay?\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve talked about the impact on the 75,000 people and their jobs.\xc2\xa0 The American public trying to follow this sort of sees this as a labor dispute.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could put this into terms for the American people.\xc2\xa0 How does this dispute affect them in terms of flights, in terms of safety?\xc2\xa0 Does this have a broad impact on the American people?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRTARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The way it affects the American people is this:\xc2\xa0 Their friends and neighbors are out of jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, look it, I used to represent a rural district.\xc2\xa0 My hometown is Peoria.\xc2\xa0 I still have a home there.\xc2\xa0 People on Main Street in Peoria get this.\xc2\xa0 They know that when their friends and neighbors are out of work that hurts everybody.\xc2\xa0 And for politicians to run around Washington, as they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for the last seven months, and talk about creating jobs, putting people back to work -- this is not the way to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American people see the fallacy in these very hollow speeches.\xc2\xa0 If Congress really believes in the words that they\'re saying about jobs, creating jobs, putting people back to work, stop your vacation, come back to Washington, pass a clean bill. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 People get this, because it\xe2\x80\x99s hurting their friends and neighbors.\xc2\xa0 To me, people understand this.\xc2\xa0 They really do.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s easily fixable.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been fixed 20 times.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s easily fixable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President gave a lot of ground in these debt talks, backing off major, major pledges.\xc2\xa0 Do you think Democrats ought to give up on this rural airport subsidy, which is small --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I think what Congress ought to do is pass a clean bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll take issue with the premise.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I mean, with how Republicans have been, I guess from your perspective, unwilling to compromise, why not have the President give the authority to do -- to move some funds around on your own?\xc2\xa0 I mean, does that make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 All of my efforts are to persuade Congress to pass a clean bill, and to try and keep the morale at the FAA high.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s -- when I went to LaGuardia, I met with unemployed construction workers.\xc2\xa0 These people are hurting.\xc2\xa0 They really are.\xc2\xa0 They can\xe2\x80\x99t apply for unemployment yet and they\xe2\x80\x99re without paychecks.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t know at the end of the day whether they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to make their next mortgage payment, car payment.\xc2\xa0 Their kids, in about 30 days, are going to be starting school.\xc2\xa0 There obviously are costs incurred by people with their children starting school.\xc2\xa0 This is why people shake their heads when they think about Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if Congress is willing to leave as they did, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that speak more than their words in the sense of that they\xe2\x80\x99re not willing to compromise -- whichever side is right or wrong -- not willing to compromise?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, there is a way for Congress to pass a bill today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they left.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I know they did.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m calling them back.\xc2\xa0 Come back to Washington.\xc2\xa0 Leave your vacations.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Just for a couple hours.\xc2\xa0 Come back, Congress.\xc2\xa0 Help your friends and neighbors get back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if your message here is that whatever action is necessary should be taken to bring those people back, and if Congress -- if Congress isn\'t going to do this, then would you accept the authority -- would you accept an order by the President -- presidential authority to take this action if executive action --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking 24/7 about how to get our people back to work.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking 24/7 about getting Congress back here.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking 24/7 about our 4,000 people who are without a paycheck, and without a paycheck now for two weeks.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s where my time and energy is.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reports yesterday had you saying that you urged the Senate to pass the House bill.\xc2\xa0 Is that still your position even though --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 My position today is, since both houses are in pro forma session, is Congress come back, and in pro forma, they could pass a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s my message today. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday it was different, Sam, because the Senate was still in and I was trying to persuade them to do something different.\xc2\xa0 Today, both houses are in pro forma.\xc2\xa0 Come back, pass a clean bill.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the easiest way to fix this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the Leader of the House is John Boehner, the Leader of the Senate is Harry Reid.\xc2\xa0 Have you talked to them and asked them to come back?\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones that have to call Congress back, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, Bill.\xc2\xa0 I talked to Senator Reid probably half a dozen times yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to Barry Jackson, the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff, more than a half a dozen times.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And your request to bring back, what is their response?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can call their offices and ask them about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on the safety question, you said safety won\'t be compromised.\xc2\xa0 Can you continue to guarantee that, especially given --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I can continue to guarantee that safety will never be compromised.\xc2\xa0 We have the safest aviation system in the world.\xc2\xa0 We would never compromise safety.\xc2\xa0 The people that are involved in safety inspections at airports that work for the FAA, many of them are using some of their own money to do their job, to pay their expenses.\xc2\xa0 You know why?\xc2\xa0 Because they\'re dedicated federal employees who believe in their mission of safety.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I can say without equivocation, safety will never be compromised.\xc2\xa0 Flying is safe.\xc2\xa0 And passenger schedules should not be compromised by this issue. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get the India question.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This question is -- Mr. Secretary, as far as these many workers out of jobs, there are many congressmen who are -- these workers are from their own districts and they must be getting heat from these people.\xc2\xa0 And second, you said safety is not the problem, you cannot compromise safety.\xc2\xa0 Are you hearing anything from around the globe, aviation ministers, as far as what drama they feel is going on in Washington?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, look it, we\'re hearing from people -- primarily, we\'re hearing from our employees.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ve not had any calls from any other transportation ministers around the country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me take a second one here, and then you, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question of compromise, we saw during the debt ceiling debate that there are quite a few members in the Republican caucus who are not willing to compromise.\xc2\xa0 What makes you think that they would be willing to compromise over this?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Well, hopefully, the cloud of debt and deficit has been lifted.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully, they\'re hearing from their constituents who are laid off, whether they\'re FAA employees or construction workers.\xc2\xa0 Many of these members of Congress have these projects going on in their states.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to keep up our drumbeat and hopefully constituents will keep up their drumbeat.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully constituents will hold people\'s feet to the fire that love to give great speeches about creating jobs and then send people home off the job sites. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think you can realistically ask safety inspectors to work through Labor Day without pay, just pro bono, out of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 We have a corps of dedicated safety people at FAA.\xc2\xa0 I\'m very proud of them.\xc2\xa0 They\'re working every day, doing their job, making sure that airports are safe, making sure that the safety inspections they do are done by the book.\xc2\xa0 And I hope the American people are proud of these people.\xc2\xa0 These are --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aren\'t they on the payroll?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 But they\'re -- look, they\'re not -- they\'re doing this, spending their own money, to travel to airports and to do their safety inspections out of their own pockets. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wait a minute, I don\'t understand, Mr. Secretary.\xc2\xa0 They\'re still on the payroll.\xc2\xa0 They\'re essential employees, right, like the traffic controllers?\xc2\xa0 Yes, so they\'re still -- so then why wouldn\'t they be reimbursed by the federal government for their travel? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 They will be, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t right now. What they\'re doing is they\'re taking their credit card; they\'re taking a flight somewhere, inspecting an airport, with the hope that they\'re going to get reimbursed.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to reimburse them.\xc2\xa0 Ordinarily, they\'d be using a government credit card to do these things.\xc2\xa0 They\'re using their personal credit cards.\xc2\xa0 Now, how many of us could do that for very long?\xc2\xa0 These are dedicated federal employees. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask if you see the difficulty mainly on the House side, or the Senate side?\xc2\xa0 Are you focusing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 The difficulty is with Congress.\xc2\xa0 Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you focusing on your energies particularly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 I\'m focusing my attention like a laser beam on Congress.\xc2\xa0 We need both houses.\xc2\xa0 End your vacation for a couple days.\xc2\xa0 Get off the beach.\xc2\xa0 Get out of your mobile homes or whatever you\'re traveling in -- (laughter) -- come back to Washington.\xc2\xa0 Pass a bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a vision.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I should have said RVs, right.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Come back.\xc2\xa0 Pass a bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Is that it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it, as ever.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY LaHOOD:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Before I take additional questions, let me give you a readout of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call with President Medvedev of Russia. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Russian President Medvedev called President Obama to wish him a happy birthday and to discuss Russia\xe2\x80\x99s WTO accession negotiations.\xc2\xa0 The Presidents -- plural -- noted the significant progress that had been made since they spoke last a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 President Obama stressed the need for Russia to work with other WTO members to close out the last remaining issues and bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion by the end of this year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Ben.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you think about employing Secretary LaHood in the debt negotiations?\xc2\xa0 If not, why not?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He does have a full-time job.\xc2\xa0 But, look, you can see that he feels very passionately about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And I think that, going to some of these questions about other actions the President may or may not be able to take, and while I trust your transportation reporter may be highly qualified and knowledgeable, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the experts to decide what other actions could be taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All of this would not be necessary if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for a political dispute that has been inserted into this process that has normally gone off without a hitch 20 times since 2005, I believe, and that has created this stalemate, which is -- the result of which, over an ideological political dispute, is that 74,000 Americans are out of work, at a time when we need every possible person who could be working to be working.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s really inexcusable.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that, as the Secretary made clear, if you want to fight about union measures and have that kind of fight later that would be fine.\xc2\xa0 But it is wholly within -- and was wholly within -- the capacity of Congress to pass a clean measure, as it has done many times in the past, to extend this authority and allow these people to continue working. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t get August back in the construction season.\xc2\xa0 You never get those paychecks back, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get that month back in the construction season.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important that Congress take action and do what it has done in the past, and what Americans expect them to do, which is -- my goodness, they want Washington to be figuring out ways to help the economy create jobs, not figuring out ways to fire people or lay them off, which is what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So understanding that, clearly, that you think it\xe2\x80\x99s Congress\xe2\x80\x99s job, if the House and Senate do stay away for August, as it\xe2\x80\x99s looking like right now, is there anything the President can do?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will address that.\xc2\xa0 The simplest thing is -- because they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to do these pro forma recesses that allow them to come back on a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice -- and the mechanics of this I\'m not all that familiar with -- but it is quite easy for members to come back, vote on this, and leave again.\xc2\xa0 So we would anticipate that, if they did have interest in ensuring that these 74,000 Americans had work, they would come back and do it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If you have the power to move the funds you could do it today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we can talk about that issue, or maybe you can talk about it with the Secretary of Transportation further.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about that.\xc2\xa0 It is not acceptable for Congress to simply say, it\xe2\x80\x99s not my business to take care of my business.\xc2\xa0 This is a process that Congress has done in the past, should do, and because of decisions they made there\xe2\x80\x99s 74,000 people out of work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about the bus tour the President plans to take -- where he\xe2\x80\x99s going and why?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that it will be from August 15th through the 17th, and that it will be through the Midwest.\xc2\xa0 Further details will be forthcoming later.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s all I have for you now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I mean, he will get out -- very happily getting out in the country again, after a sustained period here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And he will -- he looks forward to talking to folks about growing the economy, creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details, again, as I said, about the specifics of the trip later.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you say out of the country or out of -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Out in the country.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, in the country.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Midwest.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that a campaign event or --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Negative.\xc2\xa0 It is an official event.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so it will be funded by taxpayers?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s the President of the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The bus tour -- it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a visual, but what are the tangibles? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more specifics about this trip itself.\xc2\xa0 The air of cynicism is quite thick.\xc2\xa0 The idea that the President of the United States should not venture forth into the country is ridiculous.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t suggest that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, but you implied it in your question.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely important for the President, whoever that person is, in the past and in the future, to get out and hear from people in different communities.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- this is a trip that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had on our books for quite a long time, and he very much looks forward to taking it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is it more of a listening tour, then?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to -- I know that people want specifics about what he may be announcing or what proposals he might have.\xc2\xa0 It will be very focused on the economy and jobs.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait for when we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to provide more specifics.\xc2\xa0 But he will be listening and addressing these very important issues.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I know -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to this a little bit, but obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s some people who just wonder really what kind of options he has, really -- what kind of realistic options?\xc2\xa0 Because some of the things he\xe2\x80\x99s laid out have seemed a little like maybe foregone conclusions that they might have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Would that anything were a foregone conclusion in Washington today.\xc2\xa0 For example, the previously known foregone conclusion that this authorization would be extended and 74,000 people would maintain their jobs -- that used to be a foregone conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you are right to assume that everything -- or most things are now difficult.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously collectively, Congress and the President, that can take different actions to enhance growth and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 And the President has already identified a number of things that have bipartisan support that are already in Congress\xe2\x80\x99s lap that Congress can act on quite quickly.\xc2\xa0 And there are other measures that he has identified that he feels strongly about that we should support, like extension of the payroll tax credit -- essentially, a tax cut, rather -- a tax cut for working Americans.\xc2\xa0 Everyone who works pays a payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 And this is a substantial amount of money in the pocket of every American family that has helped them this year and needs to be extended so that they have that help next year. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that money is important because, unlike a lot of things you can do, this is money that will likely be spent, and therefore help the families spending it, and then have add-on positive effects on the economy because that money is then introduced into the economy.\xc2\xa0 It helps create and sustain jobs; it helps businesses.\xc2\xa0 So this is a very important measure that he supports.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Sorry, I get confused.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s okay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about the very large series of cyber attacks that were uncovered by the security company, MacAfee, affecting governments around the world, including the United States.\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us which U.S. agencies were affected and how seriously the White House sees these incidents?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me start at the top.\xc2\xa0 We are aware of this report and its contents.\xc2\xa0 While we do not comment on outside reports, detecting and blocking cyber intrusion is a key cyber security goal for this administration, working across government and with the private sector.\xc2\xa0 Cyber threats to information and communications infrastructure pose an economic and national security challenge for the United States and our partners, which is why the President has made cyber security one of his top priorities.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As with all intrusions, we employ a \xe2\x80\x9call of government approach," with the appropriate agency in the lead.\xc2\xa0 We refer you to DHS and FBI for more information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue of which agencies were affected, we are working with all federal departments and agencies to deploy defensive tools, such as the Einstein Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems.\xc2\xa0 Again, I refer you to DHS for more specifics.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you tell us when you became aware of this series of incidents?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can only tell you that we are aware of it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a date for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has repeatedly pivoted back to jobs, as he did again yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Why is this time any different?\xc2\xa0 Why should the Americans have any confidence this time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 The President has been focusing on jobs and the economy since the day he was sworn into office, during a month that saw the loss of 800,000 -- nearly 800,000 American jobs in just one month.\xc2\xa0 And that was the situation that he encountered when he took the oath.\xc2\xa0 And that has been his focus since he became President. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no question that as President you have to deal with other problems.\xc2\xa0 And in this case, the debt ceiling crisis, if you will, was a manufactured crisis.\xc2\xa0 It was a self-inflicted wound.\xc2\xa0 It was the linkage between something that Congress absolutely has to do -- which is extend the borrowing authority of the United States government -- to specific legislation that one-half of one body of Congress wanted passed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We worked through that.\xc2\xa0 We reached a compromise.\xc2\xa0 We avoided and averted catastrophe.\xc2\xa0 And that is a good thing.\xc2\xa0 Again, it was not a crisis that needed ever to present itself. But we did, through compromise, achieve some important things for the economy, for jobs -- which is a package that lifts the cloud of uncertainty of whether or not we were going to extend our borrowing authority for a significant period of time, and significantly -- has some significant initial deficit reduction attached to it, and creates a process for more significant deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Deficit reduction is an element of an economic strategy that we think is broadly agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans.\xc2\xa0 There are other things that we need to do -- and I just addressed this earlier in answer to Brianna\xe2\x80\x99s questions -- and there are measures that can be taken right away.\xc2\xa0 If Congress is very interested in creating jobs and growing the economy, there are things that it can do right away.\xc2\xa0 In addition to reinstating the 74,000 people they\xe2\x80\x99ve thrown out of work, they can move quickly to pass the free trade agreements -- the three of them that are up there -- that will create or support 70,000 additional jobs.\xc2\xa0 They can get patent reform done and they can move forward on a number of other issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President will continue to promote and put forward ideas for things we can do to create jobs and grow the economy.\xc2\xa0 But there are certainly a number of things that we can do, working together, already.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the risk of appearing cynical --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I -- not you.\xc2\xa0 Surely not after all these years.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President is really so interested in getting those 74,000 people back to work, then why don\xe2\x80\x99t you stop bashing Congress and switch the funds over so they can go to work?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, this is a fascinating process where the party with the responsibility -- the party that created this problem is out of town, and the reporters here are blaming the party that wants the problem fixed.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 look, we are obviously looking at the different options that we have, that the President has.\xc2\xa0 The simple reality is that because of a political dispute -- this is exactly what Americans loathe about the process here, justifiably and understandably -- because of an ideologically driven decision made, there is a stalemate over a measure that has never been a problem in the past. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They can resolve -- we need to, and we can, have fights over these issues that divide us.\xc2\xa0 But we should not have these fights in a way that throws 74,000 people out of -- in ways that throw 74,000 people out of work who -- innocently.\xc2\xa0 This is not their fight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so, as Secretary LaHood made clear, it is wholly inappropriate for members of Congress to go on recess, go on vacation, and leave this issue hanging, and take away from these hardworking Americans their paychecks for at least another four, five, six weeks, when they could resolve this issue right away.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure, but if your goal is to get them back --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question, Bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the goal is to get them back to work, then get them back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s within the President\xe2\x80\x99s power, apparently.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Apparently based on your hearing from some other reporter --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- who is hearing it from another.\xc2\xa0 I think maybe a little --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that not correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- a little reporting on everybody\xe2\x80\x99s part would be efficacious and --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you dispute that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- what I can say is that we are looking at things that the President might be able to do.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that Congress -- a crisis, yet again, that Congress created unnecessarily that can be resolved instantly by Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mr. Henry.\xc2\xa0 Are we going to ask this question again, because I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can the President do -- no.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you why the President can\xe2\x80\x99t call the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, who he gets along with quite well.\xc2\xa0 And Democrats yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m told, blocked a unanimous-consent agreement in the Senate to push the bill forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 I know that\xe2\x80\x99s what the Speaker of the House --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s run by a Democratic --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and his office is saying, Ed.\xc2\xa0 And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 The House measure has a provision that is designed -- that is politically motivated.\xc2\xa0 And we can have that fight.\xc2\xa0 The way to resolve -- the way to not -- in the name of achieving that<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- getting that scalp, we are preventing these 74,000 Americans from working.\xc2\xa0 So the way to do it is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Democrats blocked it, though.\xc2\xa0 Democrats blocked the request.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the House refused to pass a clean bill, which the Democrats would -- which the Senate would pass.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Then you pass a clean bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and come back in a month --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, that\'s how it works.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, no, no.\xc2\xa0 You say the top priority is to put people back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\'s how it works.\xc2\xa0 We get what we want on our unrelated political agenda item, and then we come back and fight it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s not how it works.\xc2\xa0 If you have a dispute that\'s creating a logjam that will not allow this extension to pass because of an ideological dispute, preventing 74,000 people from working, you remove the problem.\xc2\xa0 You take the splinter out, or whatever is causing the problem, and you pass the clean bill.\xc2\xa0 And then you have the fight -- if you want to have the fight on the other issue.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we believe.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick follow on the jobs issue.\xc2\xa0 If the President going -- saying yesterday in the Rose Garden, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to focus on jobs -- you were just asked about that.\xc2\xa0 He has said that over and over again.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a number of quotes.\xc2\xa0 One, January 2010: Jobs must be our number one focus in 2010.\xc2\xa0 A year and a half later, unemployment still over 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 So why should the American people have confidence that this pivot to jobs is actually going to create jobs?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, it is -- I believe I just answered this question, but the --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about patent reform and the trade deal.\xc2\xa0 Trade deals have been sitting there for a couple years, and nobody thinks that the trade deals are going to magically lower it to 7 percent --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good point.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been before Congress and they -- well, I never suggested that.\xc2\xa0 I said 70,000 jobs that could be created or supported.\xc2\xa0 The fact that there is no magic bullet that lowers our unemployment rate to where it would be ideally if -- and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not dismantling Medicare.\xc2\xa0 Is that going to put people back to work?\xc2\xa0 Is slashing clean energy investments -- will that put people back to work?\xc2\xa0 Because I don\'t hear a lot of jobs plans coming from other quarters.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I do know is that this President from the day he was sworn into office has focused aggressively on the need to, first, prevent a Great Depression, the second in our history; second, stabilize our economy, begin to see it grow again, as it has been; begin to see it create private sector jobs again, as it has been -- 2.1 million jobs -- more private sector jobs created in that period than were created in the -- net in the eight years of the previous presidency -- and then keep pressing forward to do that.\xc2\xa0 Everything that we do that\xe2\x80\x99s related to the economy is related to economic growth and job creation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What the President is saying now, and what you will be hearing him saying, is that you, the American citizen, have heard a lot of talk in Washington about debt ceilings and deficits; and while those are important issues -- very important -- and they have -- they are important in relation to our economy, and they are important in relation to jobs if they are addressed appropriately -- there are other things we can do directly that affect jobs and economic growth. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\xc2\xa0 This is not a -- I think \xe2\x80\x9cpivot\xe2\x80\x9d is not an appropriate word.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s refocusing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s continuing the focus that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had and allowing us to focus even more intently now that we have reached the compromise that was reached with Congress a couple of days ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The S&amp;P announced that it was giving the United States a negative outlook while keeping its AAA credit rating.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we focus on the things we can control, which is why we worked so hard with Congress to reach this compromise to avert a crisis that would have unquestionably resulted in bad news from the ratings agencies.\xc2\xa0 So we believe that the measures we have taken to lift that cloud, to avert that crisis, to ensure that we have borrowing authority through 2012, should send a reassuring message around the world.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that the deficit reduction that is embedded upfront within the compromise reached with Congress should send a positive message that Washington is beginning to get serious about this issue.\xc2\xa0 And the way that we approach further deficit reduction should do the same as well.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have to focus on the things we can control, and assume that, if we do our work and we do it well that the rest, if you will, will take care of yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And yet, Wall Street doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be reassured.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen stocks dip this week.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the level of concern that maybe this compromise bill didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough or isn\xe2\x80\x99t having the impact that you want it to have on the markets?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we certainly believe that we could have done more.\xc2\xa0 And the President worked very hard to try to get a grand bargain, a significant $3 trillion to $4 trillion package over 10 years that would have dealt with the real things that drive our debt, which are entitlements and revenues.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to work for a balanced package that raises that number higher -- at least the additional $1.5 trillion that has been the target for the committee, the special committee when it\xe2\x80\x99s set up, and then beyond that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, we focus on the things we can control.\xc2\xa0 We believe that if we make the right decisions about dealing with our debt and dealing with our deficits, taking measures that are responsible and effective to help create jobs and grow the economy, that other things like markets will take care of themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion that these indicators might be signs that the economy is continuing to stagnate or potentially dipping back into a recession.\xc2\xa0 Do you see it that way?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we do not believe that there is a threat there of a double-dip recession.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the economy will continue to grow.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that growth has slowed over the past two quarters.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that job creation has slowed.\xc2\xa0 But there are reasons for that --again, some of them beyond our control -- but that are beginning to -- the headwinds created by them like the earthquake in Japan, have subsided somewhat.\xc2\xa0 But there are other challenges that we have to contend with, including high energy prices, the situation in Europe, et cetera. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We, again, have to focus on what we can do to ensure that our economy is strong, that it continues to grow and create jobs. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any projections to make from here, but I would note that the outside consensus among forecasters is that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in the third and fourth quarter. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Larry Summers today in an op-ed both in The Washington Post and the Financial Times said there\xe2\x80\x99s a one in three chance that the U.S. would slip back into a recession if some more things aren\xe2\x80\x99t done to stimulate the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that a question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, what is your response to that?\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same response that I just gave to Kristin.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And he also wrote about kind of this debate over baselines in terms of what this committee of 12 or super committee is going to use as its baseline.\xc2\xa0 I know the White House has made clear that the committee has flexibility to choose whichever baseline it wants.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a preference in terms of which baseline the committee should use?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I think that what\xe2\x80\x99s important is that that committee address seriously the need to achieve further significant deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the only -- because this will be an important and clarifying process, because to achieve\xc2\xa0 -- we have now, if you will, identified and removed from the table the roughly $1 trillion in discretionary cuts that we agree on.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to get bigger, we now have to deal with these difficult issues, entitlements, for example, and tax reform.\xc2\xa0 Because, otherwise, to get bigger you have to make very specific choices about on whose backs these issues will be resolved.\xc2\xa0 Will it be only the middle class and seniors that have to ensure that our deficits and debt come down?\xc2\xa0 Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the choice you\xe2\x80\x99d have to make if you say no to revenues and you say no to cuts in our Pentagon spending.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you really have to focus -- I mean, this will be a very clarifying process, because, in some ways as we led up to this compromise, there was some understandable confusion about what deficit reduction could be achieved and where was there agreement and disagreement.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is that this President wanted to reduce deficits to cut spending.\xc2\xa0 He identified, through his negotiations with the Speaker of the House, through the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations in the group he led with the House Majority Leader -- roughly that trillion dollars that we see in the agreement represent cuts that we all agree on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, you have to make some really hard choices.\xc2\xa0 And this will be a clarifying and, we think, edifying debate in the fall.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to make sure I understand you, getting back on this FAA thing.\xc2\xa0 Did you mean to leave the impression that the President is not considering taking any action --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 In fact, I think I said three or four or five times that we will look at the measures the President may be able to take.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m simply not saying one way or the other whether I agree with Dorning\'s colleague in terms of what actions may be available to him. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are intently interested on ensuring that these 74,000 Americans who had jobs get them back, and the simplest path to that, since they were thrown out of work by a failure of Congress to act, is to bring Congress back, pass a clean extension -- which they have done 20 times in the past, in the recent past -- and put them back to work.\xc2\xa0 And then, we can have the political fight later, not at the expense of 74,000 Americans.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to sum it up, you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the measures --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but you\'d rather this to be -- you want Congress to take care of this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the measures.\xc2\xa0 And Congress has absolutely within its capacity to very quickly fix the problem it created.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Harry, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not on the FAA.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All right. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sorts of relates to Kristin\xe2\x80\x99s questions.\xc2\xa0 The stock market has been going down for eight days, which is the longest downswing in quite some time, while the bond market is rising --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just since you\xe2\x80\x99re a business reporter, where was it when he took office -- or where was it in March of \xe2\x80\x9909?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve written -- the last time I wrote about it, a lot more than 50 percent.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Close to 100 percent.\xc2\xa0 Just saying.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you obviously have a Bloomberg, too.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s been down for eight days now.\xc2\xa0 What message does the administration take from this?\xc2\xa0 A lot of the market commentators take it to be that there\xe2\x80\x99s less optimism about economic growth.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s some debate on whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going into double-dip recession.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said, you guys don\xe2\x80\x99t see that.\xc2\xa0 What message do you take from eight days going down in the stock market?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time focusing on things that we can\xe2\x80\x99t control.\xc2\xa0 We spend a lot of time focusing on things we can do that will have a positive effect on people\xe2\x80\x99s lives and specifically on their economic lives. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So markets go up, markets go down.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not for me to judge why.\xc2\xa0 The fact, broadly speaking, is that there have been a number of headwinds this year that have affected, we believe, and economists everywhere believe, have affected growth in America and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And they include the Arab Spring, the uprisings in that part of the world that have affected the energy markets; certainly, the earthquake and tsunami and the terrible devastation that caused, and it affected global supply chains; and other issues including the situation in Europe. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are taking -- and then, obviously, most recently the uncertainty created by this debate in Washington over whether the United States would, for the first time in its history, default on its obligations.\xc2\xa0 Having resolved that, fortunately, we move on to other issues and we deal with what we can deal with.\xc2\xa0 And we think if we get our part of it right, working with Congress, the economy will grow and we will create jobs and the markets will appreciate it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why did the President decide against a public signing of the bill yesterday?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he came out -- he wanted to speak immediately after the passage.\xc2\xa0 That was the moment, if you will. There was no reason except that it just a matter of signing a piece of paper, and it needed to be signed very quickly to ensure that we didn\'t inadvertently default on our obligations.\xc2\xa0 So he took care of that piece of business right away once it came down to him.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who gets the pens?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a number of people, including the leaders of both houses, who will get pens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For the interpretation that when optimum big bills pass, big important bills pass, there\xe2\x80\x99s a public --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President believes that this was an important compromise.\xc2\xa0 But make not mistake, the bigness of it in terms of the attention that was paid to it was because of a crisis that was wholly manufactured.\xc2\xa0 So he does not believe that we should be popping champagne bottles or celebrating the fact that we averted a crisis that was never necessary in the first place. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He does think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that Congress came together and compromised to avert the crisis, and compromised to achieve some measure of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 But he does not believe it is enough.\xc2\xa0 He is not, to say the least, impressed with the process, Just like every American who watched it who was appalled by the three-ring circus that was created down here that caused some of the uncertainty out there and the doubt about whether or not the greatest nation of the world could get its act together.\xc2\xa0 But he believes it was significant and that we have a lot more work to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Obviously -- well, not obviously, but my guess is the White House is not going to be making recommendations about the lawmakers who serve on this committee of 12.\xc2\xa0 But what would the President like to see in terms of those selections?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, Mitch McConnell has come out and said he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to appoint anyone who wants tax cuts on that committee.\xc2\xa0 Nancy Pelosi said something similar about protecting entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 What would the President\xe2\x80\x99s guidance to the people who are actually choosing the members be?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That they take it seriously, and that they understand that serious choices have to be made as we figure out ways to accomplish further deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would note, in terms of the comments you attributed to the Senate Minority Leader that that creates a problem within his caucus since such a substantial number of the Republicans in the Senate have supported and endorsed the ideas behind the Gang of Six proposal, which takes a very balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes $2 trillion in revenues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is simply -- as we saw after the passage of the House Republican budget, there is explaining that has to be done by the leaders in Washington.\xc2\xa0 If they want those members who believe that we should achieve deficit reduction only on the backs of senior citizens and vulnerable Americans and the middle class, they need to explain that.\xc2\xa0 And that will be ever more stark if that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach they believe is the right approach as the super committee gets started, because, as I said earlier, the initial discretionary cuts have now been accomplished and moved off the table.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with the tougher issues. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is the choice they they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make dramatic cuts, further cuts in the discretionary budget?\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be ending Medicare as we know it?\xc2\xa0 Or is it going to be a balanced approach that includes modest reforms to strengthen entitlement programs and changes in our tax code -- tax reform that simplifies it, and ends preferences for the oil and gas industries, for example, or corporate jet makers, or hedge fund managers who -- billionaires who pay lower rates of taxes than their secretaries? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that that is a debate that we look forward to having.\xc2\xa0 We believe that the preponderance of the American public supports us in that.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that for this super committee to accomplish something, there needs to be membership that represents an appreciation of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What will the White House\xe2\x80\x99s involvement be in the selection process and in the legislative process --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we obviously -- none of us here, starting with the President, is an elected member of Congress and therefore will not be on the committee.\xc2\xa0 We are not shy about making our opinion known about the kind of seriousness that we think the members of this committee should approach the task.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to express that opinion.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Steve.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I was waiting for the debt cloud to raise --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe they discussed the WTO session process. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No Syria?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The administration has had increasing pressure on the Hill and from Syrian dissidents to do more to punish Syria in the latest escalation of the crackdown.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House considering further sanctions, perhaps measures to punish foreign firms that deal in Syria, that kind of thing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that we are looking at ways to increase the pressure.\xc2\xa0 The images coming out of Syria of the Syrian government\xe2\x80\x99s brutality against its own people have been grotesque and appalling, and they demonstrate the true character of the regime.\xc2\xa0 Once again, President Assad has shown that he is completely incapable and unwilling to respond to the legitimate grievances of the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 His use of torture, corruption, and terror puts him on the wrong side of history and his people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we have stated, President Assad is not indispensable, and the U.S. has nothing invested in Assad remaining in power.\xc2\xa0 We do not want to see him remain in Syria for stability\xe2\x80\x99s sake, and rather, we view him as the cause of instability in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Through his actions, Bashar al Assad is ensuring that he and his regime will be left in the past, and that the courageous Syrian people who have demonstrated in the streets will determine Syria\xe2\x80\x99s future. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want to see the Syrian people\xe2\x80\x99s desire for democratic transformation carried out.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to call on the regime to immediately halt its campaign of violence and arrests, pull its security forces back, release the many thousand of detainees, and to respect and act upon the clear demands of the Syrian people for a peaceful and democratic transition to democracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why has this President delivered this message personally, like he did with Mubarak before?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, all I can say is that we take this matter very seriously.\xc2\xa0 I think you just heard what I said about our attitude towards what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria and to the regime\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xc2\xa0 We will certainly continue to look at ways to take further steps to put pressure on the regime to end its violence. And we think, frankly, that it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that Syria would be a better place without President Assad.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he seen pictures of Mubarak today in court?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
