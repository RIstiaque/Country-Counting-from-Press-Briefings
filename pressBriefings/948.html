EARNEST MR. PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would anticipate that today\xe2\x80\x99s events will be typical of the other campaign political events that the President has spoke at and participated in.</p>\n<p>\n\t10:36 A.M. EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, as we fly on Air Force One toward a beautiful neck of the woods in the country.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve got a couple of campaign events each, both in Vermont as well as in Maine.</p>\n<p>\n\tI have one quick announcement before I take your questions. Before departing the White House this morning, the President signed the 90-day extension of the Surface Transportation Act.\xc2\xa0 The President was pleased that Congress acted to prevent construction workers from having to go off the job because of a lapse in funding.\xc2\xa0 So he was pleased to sign the 90-day extension today.\xc2\xa0 However, we encourage Congress to act in a bipartisan fashion on a longer-term extension.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you have a readout of that coming -- since this isn\'t getting piped back, are you going to have a readout of that, signing the 90-day extension?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There will be the regular pro forma notice that will be distributed.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will that be?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think they\'ve sent it yet.\xc2\xa0 They\'re waiting for me to gaggle before doing that.\xc2\xa0 So you\'re the first to know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, do you have any update on the President\'s determination that he has to make today on the Iranian oil sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yesterday Jay made reference to the fact that we were aware that this deadline was coming and signaled our intention to meet it.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements to make on that determination this morning.\xc2\xa0 However, there will be -- we\'ll have more on this for you later today, including a conference call that will be convened by some senior administration officials who can answer any questions you may have about that determination.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said opening -- I mean -- I\'m sorry -- Jay said opening the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an option that\'s on the table.\xc2\xa0 Will the Iranian declaration play into that decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'ve said for a number of weeks now that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is one of many options that remains on the table.\xc2\xa0 But there are no specific proposals -- as we\'ve said before, there are no specific proposals that have been floated at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAs it relates to the presidential determination related to the Iran sanctions, I would refer that question to this conference call that I referenced that will take place this afternoon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President talking to officials about this during the day between campaign stops, or has the determination already been made?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any calls at this point to read out to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on Congressman Ryan endorsing Mitt Romney today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As you know, this process -- the process of the Republican Party choosing their nominee has been going on for some time.\xc2\xa0 We have, generally speaking, shown respect for that process by allowing the Republican candidates and other Republican officials and certainly Republican voters to make the decision about who they\'re going to support to be the Republican nominee.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have a specific reaction to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Republicans are coalescing, though, around Romney now -- Bush and Rubio and now Ryan -- as the eventual nominee.\xc2\xa0 It seems like that\'s moving in that direction, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There is no -- there is a primary election scheduled in Wisconsin on Tuesday and I don\'t want to get ahead of Republican voters, members of the Republican Party making their own decisions about who they believe their nominee should be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Vice President\'s remarks yesterday that an event in the Gulf could possibly cause the President to lose reelection -- was he referring to the Persian Gulf?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House see Iran as a political problem, not just a geopolitical threat?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at the fundraiser last night so I haven\'t seen the full context of the Vice President\'s remarks, so I\'m not sure I could refer to them specifically.\xc2\xa0 However, I have heard many other senior administration officials and other campaign officials note that it is not uncommon for significant outside events to influence elections.\xc2\xa0 They certainly have in the past.\xc2\xa0 And so my guess is, is what the Vice President was referring to is any series of outside events that could have an impact to some degree or another on the election.\xc2\xa0 And so my sense is that he made that reference in the context of other kinds of things like this -- certainly the ongoing financial turmoil in Europe and other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo my sense is that he was referring to some of the turmoil in the Middle East and referring to that frankly being a news-making event, but not drawing any other conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President plan to say anything at any of his events today about the Supreme Court\'s health care arguments?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\'ve certainly heard the President at previous events like this, where he\'s talking about his reelection campaign, make the case for the success that he\'s enjoyed in his first three years of fighting on behalf of middle-class families in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 And the health care has been an important -- health care reform, the Affordable Care Act was an important part of that achievement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\'re already seeing that there\'s significant benefits that the American people are enjoying because of passage of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 So there are 5 million seniors who have gotten some assistance in paying for their prescription medicine that saved them more than $3 billion --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m referring specifically to how the argument went this week.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for the President to talk about how proud he is of the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the important benefits that the American people are already enjoying as a result of that passage.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate, however, that he would comment specifically on the hearings necessarily today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, gay marriage is on the ballot in Maine in November.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to weigh in on that ballot initiative or discuss his evolving position today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that the President would make news on either of those things today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the Supreme Court, Jay said yesterday that the President thought Solicitor General Verrilli had done a good job in the arguments.\xc2\xa0 Did he listen to those himself, the audio of that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Has the President heard the audio?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if the President himself has heard the audio.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out on Wednesday, the President has been following the news coverage and received briefings from our staff at the White House about the arguments and how they\'ve proceeded.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically whether or not the President has heard the audio of those -- of the arguments.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As a constitutional law professor, is he not sort of interested in that on two fronts?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There are many reasons why the President is interested in it.\xc2\xa0 As I pointed out earlier, the Affordable Care Act is certainly one of the significant achievements of the first term of this administration and so the President is both personally and professionally invested in the arguments that are taking place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President has been following them in the news reports and has gotten specific briefings from our legal staff at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And I feel confident in saying that the President shares the opinion of our White House staff that Mr. Verrilli did a terrific job in representing the interests of the government for the Supreme Court, but also representing the interests of the 2.5 million young adults who have health insurance coverage through their parent\xe2\x80\x99s plan because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And Mr. Verrilli effectively was an advocate for the 50 million Americans who have access to free preventative coverage -- or free preventative services through their private insurance coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s essentially the role that Mr. Verrilli was charged with and everyone at the White House was pleased with his performance.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you still saying there are no contingency plans, though, if it does get voted down?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s got to be something that you guys are doing as a backup.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing and it\xe2\x80\x99s related to the implementation of this law to ensure that we can maximize benefits of the Affordable Care Act for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And I can say that when the Supreme Court rules that we\'ll be prepared to deal with it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on the RNC web ad that apparently altered the audio from the hearing of Donald Verrilli, making him sound more halting than he was?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to my colleagues at the DNC about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you do a week ahead and talk about the North American Leaders Summit on Monday?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot here, so write fast.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will host Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada and President Felipe Calderon of Mexico for the North American Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C.\xc2\xa0 The meeting will build on wide-ranging and ongoing cooperation among the United States, Canada and Mexico, with a particular focus on economic growth and competitiveness, citizen security, energy and climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe leaders will also discuss North America\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Americas in anticipation of the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia later next month, as well as other global, economic, political and security issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 And then on Wednesday the President will host an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of breakfast?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 An Easter prayer breakfast at the White House as he has done in previous years.\xc2\xa0 Christian leaders from across the country will join the President at the breakfast for a time of prayer, reflection, and the celebration of Easter.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on Wednesday, the President will sign the STOCK Act, which makes clear that members of Congress are subject to the same insider trading laws that apply to everyone else.\xc2\xa0 You will recall that this is legislation that the President called on Congress to pass in his 2012 State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, the President will sign the Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 You will recall this is bipartisan legislation that was passed by the Congress a week or two ago and it includes key initiatives that the President proposed last fall in his American Jobs Act to help small businesses and startups grow and create jobs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then on Friday, the President will deliver remarks at the White House Forum on Women in the Economy.\xc2\xa0 And later that day, the President and First Lady will mark the beginning of Passover with a seder at the White House with friends and staff.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- we should be waiting for today, Josh, from the President?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would anticipate that today\xe2\x80\x99s events will be typical of the other campaign political events that the President has spoke at and participated in.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne other noteworthy thing about our trip is the illustrious Dr. Joynt Kumar informed me this morning that this is actually the first trip of a sitting President to the state of Vermont since July of 1995 -- a little noteworthy color for the morning.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The first trip of a sitting President to Vermont since July of \xe2\x80\x9995?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 President Bush never -- President Clinton did not travel to Vermont in his second term and President Bush did not visit Vermont as President.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask one question on NALS?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are they doing that now and not just waiting to Cartagena and doing it on the margins there?\xc2\xa0 Is there some kind of thing that they\xe2\x80\x99re teeing up, some kind of joint deliverable for the summit?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any sense of -- a preview of whether or not there might be anything that will come out of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 I know that they had originally planned to do this on the margins of APEC and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Calderon had to leave.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right, because of the tragic helicopter crash. So this was an effort to reschedule that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why they\xe2\x80\x99re doing it -- they aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing it on the margins of the Summit of the Americas.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it\xe2\x80\x99s a time constraint that they had in Colombia or if there\xe2\x80\x99s something else that may have contributed to this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it certainly is -- the President does view this as an important opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Harper and President Calderon.\xc2\xa0 He meets with them frequently and their staffs are obviously in close coordination.\xc2\xa0 This will be another important opportunity for them to get together and talk.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 We have a long day, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in touch over BlackBerry and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to come find you when we\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t10:48 A.M.
