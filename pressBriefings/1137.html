EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay, you guys ready?\xc2\xa0 All right, well, good day, everyone, as we make our way to Joplin, Missouri.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I think you know, will -- upon arrival we will travel to and he will visit one of the neighborhoods that was devastated by the terrible tornadoes.\xc2\xa0 After that, he will head to Missouri Southern University, where he will participate in and speak briefly at a memorial service for the -- to the victims of the tornado, after which we will come back and fly home.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I don\'t have any other announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Joplin, do you have any sort of count on the amount of federal aid that\'s been committed so far?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to get that for you.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll find out where we are with that.\xc2\xa0 We will have -- Craig Fugate, as you know, will be meeting us -- the FEMA Administrator -- and I\'m sure he or his people will have up-to-date information on what we have provided thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been briefed this morning on the efforts on the ground?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President have a response to Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s comments on the air strikes where he said it was, I believe, \xe2\x80\x9chis last warning\xe2\x80\x9d were his words?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t spoken to the President about that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that, as you know, we work very hard, our military in Afghanistan, to do everything we can to avoid civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 We coordinate, obviously, work with the Afghan government, Afghan military with that goal.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I\'d refer you to the Defense Department in terms of the nature of the missions and what we\'re doing over there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s comment, it seemed very provocative.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there anything --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything more on that, except obviously President Karzai has expressed on a number of occasions his concerns about civilian casualties.\xc2\xa0 Those are concerns that we share and take very seriously.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the French foreign minister\xe2\x80\x99s remark that there\xe2\x80\x99s agreement among the G8 that Lagarde should be the new IMF chief?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\'t go beyond what we\'ve said, which is we support the process that\'s been set up by the IMF to find a successor, and we support the process that produces the best possible candidate.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- McFaul to Russia?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to comment on an announcement that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you want the job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would take the job, but nobody has offered it to me.\xc2\xa0 I would love to go back to Moscow at some point.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the President briefed on the cyber attack on Lockheed Martin?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been part of the briefing materials that he has, but I -- I have seen what the Defense Department has been saying about this and I can\'t go beyond -- I don\'t have anything more than they have.\xc2\xa0 And my understanding based on what I\'ve seen is that they feel it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly minimal in terms of the damage.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, what was that question?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The cyber attack on Lockheed Martin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about the Republican conference meeting this week and what the President hopes to get out of it in terms of the deficit talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as he has in the past when he\xe2\x80\x99s had these kinds of meetings, he looks forward to this because he thinks that sitting down and meeting with lawmakers -- in this case, Republicans -- is an important part of the process.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important part of listening and comparing ideas.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of thing that I think he believes the American people and the vast majority of the American electorate expect our leaders to do in Washington, rather than just trade opinions back and forth without actually talking; that talking is good.\xc2\xa0 So he looks forward to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will Vice President Biden be involved in the talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have to check.\xc2\xa0 He tends to be.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know specifically if he\xe2\x80\x99s -- he might be traveling or something, but he tends to be.\xc2\xa0 As you know, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously leading the negotiations on the deficit --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any new proposals for them to chew on?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\'t think so.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the negotiations being led by the Vice President, that\'s the venue for trying to find an agreement on significant deficit reduction, and that smaller venue is where that sort of discussion would take place, not in a bigger meeting with a lot of members.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel that process is going so far -- the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s talks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He feels, and we feel, optimistic, that the process has been serious, that the participants have worked together to try to find common ground.\xc2\xa0 And the President remains, the Vice President remains optimistic that it will produce an agreement that will allow for significant deficit reduction, which is a goal that the President and the Vice President share with the leaders of Congress that they\xe2\x80\x99re negotiating with.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- were gone the Republican presidential nominating process got heated up a little bit.\xc2\xa0 There were some slings shot at the President from here.\xc2\xa0 Tim Pawlenty said that while the President was off on a European pub crawl he -- instead of offering a Medicare plan of his own.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on that or some of the other --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I have no comment on the -- in response to that statement.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say that the President has put forward a serious deficit reduction plan that does produce entitlement savings, including in Medicare, building on the entitlement savings he\xe2\x80\x99s already included in the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated his commitment and seriousness to reducing the kind of spending in that important part of -- important contributor to our deficit and debt problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut he has also put forward a balanced plan that includes -- that makes sure that both prosperity and sacrifice is shared by everyone.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes very strongly that his approach is the right approach so that we can -- again, so that the burden as well as the prosperity is shared by everyone and that we continue to invest in the areas like education, innovation, infrastructure, that will allow us to continue to grow and create jobs in the 21st century -- which, after all, is the purpose of this, right?\xc2\xa0 The reason to cut the deficit, the reason to get your fiscal house in order is to ensure that we continue to grow our economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 It is not, in and of itself, an esoteric goal.\xc2\xa0 It is a goal -- the goal here is job creation and economic growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President feels strongly that to position ourselves most effectively for the coming decade and decades to compete economically we need to -- this is something that needs to be done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the report in The Washington Post today that tensions with the Pentagon are the reason that the President is not going with Cartwright for the Joint Chiefs job?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no comment on potential appointments he might make.\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s relations with the Defense Department, the Pentagon, with his military commanders are excellent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t12:25 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
