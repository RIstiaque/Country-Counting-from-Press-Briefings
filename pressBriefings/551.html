Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:54 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have with me, as you can see today, another guest briefer, the Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who is going to talk to you a little bit about the President\xe2\x80\x99s event today where he will sign the executive order that raises the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour, and why it is an important step forward towards achieving the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective here, which is ensuring that if you work hard, if you take responsibility for yourself and your family, you should not be paid a wage that keeps you in poverty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, as you know, the President very much wants to see Congress take action on this, but this is a step he can take using his authority, and he will sign that order today.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, as in keeping with past practice, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the Secretary speak first.\xc2\xa0 You can address questions to him on subject areas that he covers at the top.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll let him go and I\xe2\x80\x99ll remain for questions on other subjects.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The President has said that this year will be a Year of Action, and so today he will take an important step to expand opportunity by rewarding hard work with fair wages.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In a short time from now, the President will sign an executive order to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 for workers employed through federal contracts.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re serving food or doing laundry on a military base, if you\xe2\x80\x99re a nursing assistant caring for our nation\xe2\x80\x99s veterans, if you\xe2\x80\x99re staffing the parking lot at a federal courthouse, or if you\xe2\x80\x99re working concessions at our national parks, then you deserve a raise.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in the State of the Union address, if you cook our troops\xe2\x80\x99 meals or wash their dishes, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to live in poverty.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President believes that the federal government should lead by example as a model employer, joining so many other private businesses who recognize that paying a fair wage is both the right thing to do, the smart thing to do, and the efficient thing to do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We estimate that the executive order will benefit hundreds of thousands of people directly by increasing their pay, but it will also improve taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 return on their investment.\xc2\xa0 Higher wages make for a more productive workforce, thus improving the quality and efficiency of services provided to the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this should be a first step.\xc2\xa0 Every American worker, not just federal contract employees, need a raise.\xc2\xa0 That will take an act of Congress.\xc2\xa0 So the administration will continue to push strongly for the passage of the Harkin-Miller bill, which will increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 And in the meantime, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to encourage and support efforts at the state level and at the local level to do the same.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with that, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to take any questions.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, do you have an estimate on how many workers are going to be helped by this federal contract raise?\xc2\xa0 I know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been coming up with a -- there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a full -- in the last few weeks.\xc2\xa0 Do you have a better --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, we estimate that it will be in the hundreds of thousands.\xc2\xa0 And the reason we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a more precise estimate than that is as we finalize the regulations in the course of the ensuing months, that will give us a better handle on that.\xc2\xa0 I had read a study that it indicated that it was in the millions.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\xe2\x80\x99s too high.\xc2\xa0 And the assumptions that were involved in that estimate, including the fact that they had a $12/hour minimum wage, those assumptions didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to the executive order that the President will be issuing.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that our estimates are where the actual number will be.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 You said hundreds of thousands -- during what time period?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 During the course -- it goes into effect January 1st of next year.\xc2\xa0 So not every contract will come up January 1st of next year.\xc2\xa0 So in the course of the ensuing period of time, which will be months and years for contracts to come to the end of their life and be renewed, then you will have more and more people benefitting.\xc2\xa0 The President was very explicit about not wanting it to interfere with contracts that are already in place.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you a specific question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve given us an estimate here.\xc2\xa0 You claim this is going to benefit hundreds of thousands of workers.\xc2\xa0 So is this during the first year, during the first five years, during the first ten years?\xc2\xa0 What period of time are we talking about?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 It will benefit hundreds of thousands of workers as new contracts come in place.\xc2\xa0 And new contracts will come in place over the course of years beginning January 1st of 2015 when the executive order goes into effect.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So over the course of eternity?\xc2\xa0 I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering, what\xe2\x80\x99s the --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Over the course of a number of years -- three to five years.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Three to five years?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Some will benefit year one, more will benefit year two, more will benefit year three.\xc2\xa0 Even more will benefit in the ensuing years.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what percentage of workers on federal contracts make the minimum wage, or make less than $10.10 an hour?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a precise figure because we\xe2\x80\x99re still finalizing the regulations and preparing the regulations.\xc2\xa0 But, again, we estimate that there are hundreds of thousands of workers who will benefit from this, which means they are making below $10.10 an hour right now.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one last question.\xc2\xa0 What more will this cost?\xc2\xa0 Because obviously you\xe2\x80\x99re raising the wages of those working on federal contracts, so what will be the cost of this?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 All federal agencies will be doing this within their existing budget.\xc2\xa0 And the reason why this is the efficient thing to do is because when employers are paying a fair wage, they have a more efficient workforce.\xc2\xa0 And when you have a workforce where you have less attrition, you have those sorts of efficiencies.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that just like so many other private sector companies that have paid a fair wage and have low attrition and an efficient and effective workforce, that we will realize the same efficiencies here in the federal government.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowing the price of the contract to go up?\xc2\xa0 Are you preventing that in the executive order?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 All of this will be implemented within the existing budget of agencies.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s not a bump-up in the budget to account for this.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, the efficiencies of paying a fair wage are what we will gain from this executive order.\xc2\xa0 The President has said many times that the federal government should set the example, and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, there were some who had hoped that this would apply to existing contracts.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain both the legal and economic reasons why that decision was not made?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President made a judgment, and I agree that it should be applying to new contracts so that in the middle of a contract there\xe2\x80\x99s not the disruption of having to have a wage inserted that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in place when you negotiated the contract to begin with.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there ever going to be litigation over that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, no, again, the President wanted to draw an appropriate balance between ensuring that we have a minimum wage and also minimizing disruption on contractors.\xc2\xa0 And changing the rules in the middle of a contract we felt would be disruptive and that is why it applies to future contracts and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take effect until January of 2015.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you can see there will be some economic lag time before these benefits are actually enjoyed and then translates to the broader economy?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, any law that you put in place will have an effective date that is some time down the road.\xc2\xa0 And so this is no different than any other law, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s increases in the minimum wage that Congress has passed, which had an effective date down the road.\xc2\xa0 We just issued some regulations to help home health care workers and we had a delayed effective date so that we could work with the various stakeholders to ensure the effective implementation of that law.\xc2\xa0 This is no different than any other law that would address these important pocketbook issues for people.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, this is obviously something -- right here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jeff.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi -- that the President can do with his pen.\xc2\xa0 How likely is it, though, that you will get congressional support for doing a broader minimum wage hike?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of appetite for this among Republicans.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m very optimistic --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m optimistic because I look at history.\xc2\xa0 First of all, I look at where the American people are.\xc2\xa0 The American people, regardless of your ideological stripes, strongly support an increase in the minimum wage and they support it because they support the proposition that nobody who works a full-time job should have to live in poverty.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when members of Congress go home, they listen to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 I was in New Jersey earlier this week -- or last week, in Jersey City, listening to baggage workers who are working at Newark Airport talking about how they\xe2\x80\x99re making choices between food and health care; how a guy\xe2\x80\x99s son just turned 16 and he had to look him in the eye and say, I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to buy you a birthday present because I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to buy food for us.\xc2\xa0 These are stories that we hear all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if you look at the history of the minimum wage, it has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support, whether it was the increase that George W. Bush signed or the increase that one of my predecessors, Elizabeth Dole, spoke proudly of in helping to shepherd.\xc2\xa0 And so this issue has enjoyed bipartisan support, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that it will continue to.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll fight very hard because, again, people are working hard and falling further behind, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy bipartisan support right now.\xc2\xa0 What do you think needs to change to make that political calculus different?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 I think when members listen even more to their constituents they will see that people are working 40, 50 hours a week and they\xe2\x80\x99re on food stamps.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll see that we\xe2\x80\x99re subsidizing the banking industry to the tune of $900 million a year, because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got bank tellers who are working and collecting food stamps.\xc2\xa0 The fast food industry subsidized to the tune, according to one report, of $7 billion a year.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If we want to reduce reliance on public subsidies like food stamps, if we want to promote self-sufficiency, which I think there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support for, if we want to make sure that we reward work and really acknowledge the dignity of work, raising the minimum wage makes a lot of sense.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think the American people are ahead of some in Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that as people go back and listen to their constituents that this movement will continue to grow.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, this is not indexed for inflation, right?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect.\xc2\xa0 It is indexed for inflation.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 And then the second question is, in the job retraining -- or job training project that the Vice President spearheaded, is there a timeframe?\xc2\xa0 Can you just remind us, is there a timeframe in which that work is going to be completed?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working feverishly now and we will be throughout the year, because we want to get back to the American people as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 And I meet with the Vice President with great regularity as we draw a blueprint for ensuring that people have career pathways and those tickets to the middle class that come when you have access to training and upward mobility.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I apologize, maybe I should have looked this up.\xc2\xa0 Are there people -- I understand this is for contractors.\xc2\xa0 Are there federal government employees who earn less than $10.10 an hour now, people at the Justice Department or Labor Department or in the White House complex who are earning less than that $10.10 figure now?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the answer to your question, so I\xe2\x80\x99d have to get back to you.\xc2\xa0 And to that extent that there are, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly looking into ways to address those issues as well.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At the end of last month, the President talked about helping out the long-term unemployed by encouraging companies to overlook their employment history and also their credit scores.\xc2\xa0 Aside from doing a solid for the people that are affected by that, why is that good business practice?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve met with so many long-term unemployed in the course of the last few months.\xc2\xa0 And what I saw was these are people with immense talent.\xc2\xa0 They find themselves in a predicament that is no fault of their own.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re in the quintessential Catch-22 -- I can\'t pay my bills right now, and I need a job to pay my bills.</p>\n<p>And so what we did and what the President did in meeting with the CEOs and getting the pledges of over 300 companies was, again, to use his convening authority to help address this issue.\xc2\xa0 And it was a fascinating conversation, because what we realized is that there are so many companies who have practices that are benign, such as a credit check.\xc2\xa0 I can understand why someone would want to do a credit check for somebody, but the reality is, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been unemployed for two years, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably missed a couple payments.\xc2\xa0 And what we saw in that room was a willingness from companies to look at people\xe2\x80\x99s abilities and take a fresh look.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we also compared and highlighted many best practices, including the fact that we have the authority and are actually involved in some very promising work where we subsidize wages.\xc2\xa0 So if an employer hires someone who is long-term unemployed right now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll pay half the wage over six to eight months, and sometimes even more.\xc2\xa0 And what we have found is that program really works well.\xc2\xa0 So that convening really helped us to shine a light on this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we have a $150 million grant solicitation that is going out imminently to further promote those best practices.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If two employees who are otherwise equally qualified, one of whom currently has a job or has been unemployed for a day, another one who has been unemployed for 13 months, the company shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t look at that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, this -- what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do in this program is have the company appreciate that that person who has been unemployed for 13 months has tremendous talent.\xc2\xa0 And what we heard from companies was that, you know what, I used to look skeptically on that person who had been out for 13 months.\xc2\xa0 We took a risk, and they\'re some of our most productive employees.\xc2\xa0 And so that\'s what we were trying to communicate is that sometimes we put in place certain filters that prevent us from seeing potential in people, and that\'s what this initiative is about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I was really heartened at the spirit of the enterprise. It\xe2\x80\x99s very similar to our actions in hiring veterans where employers have really stepped up in a big way.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to see the same thing happen here.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just am wondering why if the administration feels so strongly about this it didn\'t do it before?\xc2\xa0 So is this something --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 What is the \xe2\x80\x9cthis\xe2\x80\x9d in your sentence?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry -- the executive order.\xc2\xa0 Going back to the executive order.\xc2\xa0 So is this something that you pushed for personally?\xc2\xa0 Or is it something that would have had a negative impact on the economy when it was more fragile a couple of years ago?\xc2\xa0 Or how do you explain --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President has been very, very strong in stating that we have to reward work with a fair wage.\xc2\xa0 And he has continued to work with stakeholders across the aisle in an effort to raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 And over the course of the last year, that has been unsuccessful to date.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that the winds are changing in that context.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the President felt that it was important for the federal government to model behavior.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t go out and tell the private sector that they need to raise the minimum wage if we\xe2\x80\x99re not practicing what we preach.\xc2\xa0 And so that\xe2\x80\x99s what this executive order is about:\xc2\xa0 practicing what we preach; modeling best practices; and demonstrating that you can pay a fair wage, have an efficiently run government, and help put money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, which stimulates consumption, which stimulates job growth.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chris.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of executive orders, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of discussion recently about a potential executive order that would bar federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\xc2\xa0 If the President were to sign such an executive order, could the Labor Department implement it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get into what-ifs.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly aware of the executive order that was proposed that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.\xc2\xa0 And the President takes a backseat to no one in his commitment for equal access to opportunity for people regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that we continue to contemplate and work on.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a related note, there\xe2\x80\x99s also been talk about implementing existing order -- Executive Order 11246, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, and apply that to transgender workers to prohibit discrimination against them in the wake of Macy v. Holder.\xc2\xa0 Will the Labor Department take that step?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 That issue is under review in the aftermath of the Macy decision.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my staff to expedite that review so that we can bring that issue to conclusion at the Department of Labor.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When will the review come to an end?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping it will come to an end as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just following, in terms of -- the President has been in office now for more than five years.\xc2\xa0 Why is this coming now -- now, and not in 2009 or 2010?\xc2\xa0 What has changed?\xc2\xa0 Now is just the broader focus on the issue of income inequality?\xc2\xa0 Or is there --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to put us back in context.\xc2\xa0 In 2009, we were dealing with the Great Recession, bleeding 800,000 jobs a month.\xc2\xa0 The President was I think appropriately focused on the Recovery Act and all the issues that were involved in trying to stop the bleed and prevent this economy from going into a depression.\xc2\xa0 And he succeeded in doing that.\xc2\xa0 There are so many things -- and Jay is far more conversant in things happening around the world.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has taken multitasking to new levels in this administration.\xc2\xa0 And so it certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect a lack of interest in this, it reflects the fact that we were confronting in 2009 a crisis.\xc2\xa0 As we move forward, as the economy continues to grow -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 47 consecutive months of private sector job growth to the tune of 8.5 million private sector jobs -- the time is now, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, to really act on the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a way to put more money in people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, stimulate consumption, stimulate job growth, and really address this issue of fairness.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think now is the right time, and the President is going to continue to do his level best to ensure not only the effect of implementation of this EO, but also to ensure passage of a federal minimum wage hike.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just get two clarifications, just very quick, on the hundreds of thousands?\xc2\xa0 Is this 200,000; 900,000?\xc2\xa0 How many hundreds of thousands will this benefit?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, as we develop the regulations we will have a better sense of that.\xc2\xa0 And as soon as we have that better sense we will let you know.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me make sure I got what you said -- I think it was to Chuck -- correct.\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- contractors will pay more money to their employees but this won\xe2\x80\x99t cost any more money?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 The federal agencies --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t be more expensive?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Federal agencies will be doing this within their existing budgets.\xc2\xa0 And again, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty robust body of evidence that demonstrates that when you have a workforce that receives a fair wage, you lower attrition, you increase efficiency and you can do more.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why Costco pays a fair wage.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Ace hardware store in Northwest D.C. that I just visited pays above the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a very strong body of evidence that demonstrates that.\xc2\xa0 And we will be efficient here and --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But we are going to close the loop on something.\xc2\xa0 I guess what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying is it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to cost the budgets more, but the contracts themselves, could they cost more?\xc2\xa0 You say they got to work within their own budget, but it could it mean, say, instead of 10 contracts it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be nine because of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, agencies are going --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the contracts could end up costing more?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Well, again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know that, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what -- first of all, agencies, as I said before, are operating within their existing budgets.\xc2\xa0 And businesses will bid on these contracts, and frankly, many of them already pay the minimum wage or a higher minimum wage in other contexts.\xc2\xa0 And so this won\xe2\x80\x99t be an increased cost for them.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think it would be inaccurate to suggest without further evidence that that would happen, because we already see a lot of employers out there.\xc2\xa0 Remember, we have prevailing wage laws that have been in effect for decades that require employers to pay prevailing wages, which are far above the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen contracting dry up or go away.\xc2\xa0 When I was Labor Secretary in Maryland we implemented the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first living wage law.\xc2\xa0 We saw an increase in the number of contractors.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you promote efficiencies like we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here, good things happen.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 SECRETARY PEREZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Take care.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank the Secretary for joining us today and I will take your questions after I make a couple of points at the top.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>First of all, as you know, according to the National Weather Service, a very complex weather pattern will continue to affect the southern United States through Thursday.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, President Obama declared an emergency for 45 counties in Georgia at the request of Governor Nathan Deal, authorizing FEMA to support the state in its efforts to respond to the storm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President was briefed yesterday morning and updated during today\xe2\x80\x99s presidential daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 He directed his team to stay in close touch with our federal partners as well as the state and local officials leading the response.\xc2\xa0 FEMA has deployed an incident management assistance team to the Georgia emergency operations center, and additional teams are on alert for deployment as needed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>FEMA has liaisons in the emergency operations centers of South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, and has identified liaisons for other impacted states ready to deploy, should they be requested.\xc2\xa0 FEMA has activated its national response coordination center in Washington, D.C. and its regional response coordination center in Atlanta.\xc2\xa0 And later today, FEMA will activate in Philadelphia to help coordinate any requests for assistance from affected states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In addition to providing around-the-clock staffing support to FEMA\xe2\x80\x99s distribution centers in Atlanta, FEMA has also activated an incident support base to pre-stage commodities, including generators, meals, water, blankets, and cots in Augusta, Georgia.\xc2\xa0 We encourage residents and visitors in the track of the storms to follow the instructions of state, local, and tribal officials; to monitor NOAA weather radio, and to monitor their local news for updates and directions provided by local officials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, I wanted to let you know that due to the severe weather that I just mentioned and that is forecasted to hit this area, the D.C. area tonight and tomorrow, and acting out of an abundance of caution, we will reschedule the event at the White House tomorrow to launch the \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d initiative.\xc2\xa0 We are working to find a new date for this event and we\xe2\x80\x99ll share more information about that as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>And now to your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just to move the minimum wage debate into the legislative realm, what has the White House been asking of Senator Reid and Democrats on the Hill in terms of a timeline for bringing this up?\xc2\xa0 Do you now see this, especially with immigration perhaps moving to the background a bit, as the most realistic legislative priority for the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a very high priority for the reasons that Secretary Perez just outlined.\xc2\xa0 In America, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work full-time and live in poverty.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.\xc2\xa0 And I think a broad majority of Americans support that idea; certainly the President does.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with both houses of Congress and leaders in both houses of Congress to press this issue.\xc2\xa0 I would not agree with the premise that immigration is moving to the background.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Speaker Boehner said he\xe2\x80\x99s not planning to bring it up any time soon.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the Speaker identified the fact that this has long been a difficult issue for the Republican Party, but the fact is there has been significant progress on comprehensive immigration reform, including the principles that the leadership of the House put out just a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a giant step in the direction of comprehensive immigration reform becoming a reality -- well, maybe not a giant step, but a reasonably large step given where the House had been in the past.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are certainly not of the opinion that we can\xe2\x80\x99t get this done in 2014.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re still optimistic that comprehensive immigration reform can get done this year -- not because we want it, not because the President says it should happen, but because businesses across the country say it, Republicans and Democrats across the country say it; labor groups, faith-based groups and law enforcement groups say it should happen.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the minimum wage, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to work with leadership to have the Congress take this matter up.\xc2\xa0 And we want to see Congress raise the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But have you set any kind of timeframe for that?\xc2\xa0 Because you wanted them to do this last year and obviously that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re putting a timeframe around it or something to try to ratchet up the pressure.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe to describe to you today.\xc2\xa0 But we are in active conversations with leaders on the Hill about how to move this issue forward.\xc2\xa0 Because, again, this is broadly supported by the American people.\xc2\xa0 The evidence that the Secretary was talking about with Jon about the fact that raising the minimum wage does not have a discernable effect on job creation and creates efficiencies across the board, and injects energy into the economy, because you\xe2\x80\x99re paying people a living wage.\xc2\xa0 And especially, when you\xe2\x80\x99re at that minimum wage, you tend to be spending what you earn and that has positive economic impact.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of reasons to get this done, and we think it will get done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, a bit of a logistical question.\xc2\xa0 King Abdullah of Jordan has been in Washington for most of the week, and he met with the Vice President today.\xc2\xa0 Why couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President have met with King Abdullah in Washington?\xc2\xa0 Why does he have to go out to California to do that?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve announced the schedule and the fact that he is meeting with the King out in California, and the President looks forward to that meeting.\xc2\xa0 The King has a lot of partners that he has conversations with, including in the administration the Vice President, the Secretary of State and others, as well as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure on Capitol Hill -- Jordan being an important partner in the region for the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President will meet with the King out in California, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout yet of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with him this morning, but I know that was an important part of his time here in D.C.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess I just don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, though, if the King has been here where the President is for three, almost four days, why do they both have to go --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, I think we put out a schedule for California that includes the President is going to Fresno, where he is going to discuss the effects of this historic drought in California.\xc2\xa0 The King is also going to go out to California.\xc2\xa0 The President and the King can meet there and will meet there as part of this trip.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to follow up on something that Secretary Perez said in response to Chris\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration contemplating executive action on LGBT workplace non-discrimination?\xc2\xa0 That was the word that he used.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what I can say to that is what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said in the past, is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on obviously the discussion in Washington and beyond about that kind of executive action.\xc2\xa0 What our position is and has been is that we strongly support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\xc2\xa0 We note the progress made in the Senate, the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s been movement in the Senate on this, and I think against some of the conventional wisdom we\'ve seen movement on this.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the broader range of issues around LGBT rights, we\'ve seen dramatic progress, and we\'re going to keep pressing Congress to catch up with the country on these issues.\xc2\xa0 Turning the Employment Non-Discrimination Act into law would be a huge step forward by Congress, and the President looks forward to that happening.\xc2\xa0 But I just don\'t have any update on the discussion around other hypothetical EOs, and I think that\'s what Secretary Perez was indicating.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a hypothetical, so I just wanted to clarify, should we read into that any sort of a shift in the position of maybe going away from just a congressional push back to the possibility of an executive order?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think broadly speaking, the administration looks at all opportunities to advance an agenda that expands opportunity, that levels the playing field, that sustains equal opportunity for all that is part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s vision.\xc2\xa0 That\'s as a broad matter.\xc2\xa0 On specific -- would the President do this executive action or that executive action, I mean, that list could be endless, and I don\'t have any update for you on that kind of proposition.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that it is our policy position that the House ought to and the Congress ought to send the Employment Non-Discrimination Act to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk so he can sign it into law.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one question on the debt ceiling.\xc2\xa0 Is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view, or your view, that what happened yesterday is the end of debt ceiling fights with the Republicans?\xc2\xa0 Or is this a temporary blip for 2014?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our view that yesterday represented a victory for the American economy and the American middle class. An end to that kind of brinksmanship for now is a very welcome thing.\xc2\xa0 As a sort of starting principle, Washington should not be causing harm to the American economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s what Washington and Congress, Republicans in Congress had been doing through the kinds of brinksmanship that we\'ve seen in the past over shutting down the government or threatening default.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So obviously, yesterday was a very positive development.\xc2\xa0 It says something about the expectations that the American people have of Congress that people notice when Congress actually doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do direct harm to the economy.\xc2\xa0 And by Congress I mean Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 This has been an effect brought about entirely by the ideological passions of House Republicans in particular.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing that we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing it happen again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can\'t predict the future.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is this will be the third time now, hopefully, that the debt ceiling has been raised without drama or delay.\xc2\xa0 And it would be hard to argue in the future that somehow having done it three times doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter; now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to threaten to shut the government down again.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s threaten to default on the full faith and credit of the United States again.\xc2\xa0 I think that argument becomes harder to sustain in the future, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what the future will bring.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Brianna.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 On the debt ceiling, does the President think that this came about because of taking this position of we will not negotiate on the debt ceiling?\xc2\xa0 Does he think it has to do with election-year politics?\xc2\xa0 What does he attribute this development to?\xc2\xa0 Maybe speaking to a certain --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what happened yesterday reflects the fundamental soundness of the position the President has taken, which is that the President of the United States -- whether he or she is a Democrat or a Republican -- should not pay on behalf of the American people a ransom to Congress so that Congress authorizes the bills that Congress racked up to be paid.\xc2\xa0 You engage in that practice and you undermine the faith that the world has in the American economy, and you do enormous harm to the American economy and the American middle class -- all out of ideological pique.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President held firm to the position that he\xe2\x80\x99s had, feeling very confident that it was the right position. \xc2\xa0Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a reward to any President, as Democrat or Republican, for Congress to do its fundamental responsibility.\xc2\xa0 It is the least that Congress can and should do -- and in this case, Republicans can and should do -- on behalf of their constituents, which is not to throw the American or global economy into chaos.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s an important milestone in our view.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you worry at all, having sort of gone out in this move to go around Congress where he can -- I mean, if this is a sign of maybe slightly -- you had the budget deal, you have this -- I mean, did maybe he jump the gun on sort of talking about going around Congress when maybe there is a sign that right now it\xe2\x80\x99s a little easier to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You left out the farm bill.\xc2\xa0 I think that what that reflects -- no, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important question.\xc2\xa0 It reflects that the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposition was never that he was, from now into the future, only going to act using his administrative authority or executive authority.\xc2\xa0 He was making clear that where Congress would not work with him on behalf of expanding the economy and rewarding hard work and responsibility, he would take actions that he could to advance that agenda.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But he\xe2\x80\x99s always eager, as demonstrated by the bipartisan farm bill that he signed into law, by the budget deal and the funding that went along with the budget deal, and by the prospects for immigration reform and the prospects for raising the minimum wage, that he\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely eager to work very hard with lawmakers of both parties to advance an agenda that helps the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s never been an either/or proposition.\xc2\xa0 We have seen a lot of obstructionism in Congress and that\xe2\x80\x99s been to the detriment of the American economy and the American people.\xc2\xa0 So where that continues to be a problem, the President is going to act using the authority that he can.\xc2\xa0 He is certainly not going to allow Congress to prevent him from doing the very best he can do on behalf of the American people and the economy.\xc2\xa0 But he can\xe2\x80\x99t, he fully recognizes, do everything that needs to be done by himself.\xc2\xa0 Some of the actions that we need to take here to solidify our recovery, to further secure the middle class, to advance innovation has to be done with Congress.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to working with Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 Can you just comment on Senator Paul and FreedomWorks have filed a class-action lawsuit against President Obama and the FBI Director, NSA Director, DNI when it comes to the phone metadata program that was revealed by Edward Snowden. \xc2\xa0Do you have a reaction to that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, about a specific matter of litigation I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 And while I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to speak to a pending lawsuit, what I can say is that in January the President emphasized that, \xe2\x80\x9cin an extraordinarily difficult job, one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic, the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.\xc2\xa0 They are not abusing authorities in order to listen to your phone calls or read your e-mails.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And to the extent that the question you ask refers specifically to the Section 215 bulk metadata collection program, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said previously, we believe that the program, as it exists, is lawful.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not alone.\xc2\xa0 It has been found to be lawful by multiple courts and it receives oversight from all three branches of government, including the Congress.</p>\n<p>So, again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to the specific litigation, but I can speak to what the President\xe2\x80\x99s views are and what the administration\xe2\x80\x99s views are about the program in question.</p>\n<p>Let me move around a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Clearly, Syria was on the agenda.\xc2\xa0 Biden talked with King Abdullah, and will be as well in California.\xc2\xa0 I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t make a habit of commenting on everything that Senator McCain says, but he had a fairly broad attack this morning in the Senate floor on the President.\xc2\xa0 He cited the Directive on Mass Atrocities, of Holocaust Museum comments, U.N. speech.\xc2\xa0 He said, how can a leader of a free world who says it\xe2\x80\x99s the moral obligation to do what we can to prevent worst atrocities -- how can it be that he\xe2\x80\x99s not doing more to prevent atrocities occurring every single day in Syria.\xc2\xa0 Is the President still feeling pretty fulfilled -- everything he said about atrocities in all of these venues in terms of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States is doing more than any other country in an effort to provide humanitarian relief to the Syrian people, in an effort to help bring parties together and help bring the two sides together to resolve this conflict in the only way it can ultimately be resolved, which is through a negotiated political settlement and the creation of a transitional governing authority.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way out for Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has made clear, as he did just yesterday in his press conference with President Hollande, that he understands how terrible the situation has been and continues to be in Syria.\xc2\xa0 And that is why it is so important to continue to press for progress in the talks and to continue to keep the pressure on the Assad regime so that it is held responsible for the brutality that it has inflicted on the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we support the opposition.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why we provide aid to the opposition.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t see Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what exactly he\xe2\x80\x99s advocating.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x99s advocating a U.S. invasion of Syria, I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 Is he advocating a bombing campaign?</p>\n<p>The President has spoken clearly about his views on these issues.\xc2\xa0 He, as he made clear yesterday, doesn\'t take options off the table as a general principle as President.\xc2\xa0 But it has certainly been his view that the course of action that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken when it comes to Syria has been the right one.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press for a resolution through the only means that one can be achieved.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up briefly on NSA.\xc2\xa0 Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the President actually visited NSA?\xc2\xa0 We had all those reports about morale -- damage to morale there because of the controversy over the surveillance.\xc2\xa0 Is he planning a visit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has spoken clearly in a very high-profile speech about his high regard for the professionals, largely anonymous professionals, Americans who, in our intelligence community and specifically at the NSA, work under enormous amounts of pressure to keep us safe and do so following protocols that ensure the privacy of ordinary Americans, and do so knowing that their successes -- because of the nature of their work -- will go unnoticed and unreported upon by and large, and that any failures, any mistakes, any misses can result in calamity.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a lot of pressure to put on any American, and we should remember -- and the fact that so many of our fellow citizens are doing that work on our behalf.</p>\n<p>Major, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you agree that the import of today\xe2\x80\x99s executive order, at least for the short term, is political symbolism, not economic vitality?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not if you\xe2\x80\x99re one of the families that\xe2\x80\x99s affected.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be affected until next year, at the very earliest.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I think as Secretary Perez said, yes, the executive order takes effect on January 1st.\xc2\xa0 And then as contracts become --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Contracts have to come in, be approved.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a considerable amount of time after.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can diminish or dismiss --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- the effect for that family where the father or the mother is now going to be making $10.10 an hour instead of a lower wage and the effect that will have on that family.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t resolve the problem or the need to raise the minimum wage across the country.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on Congress, in the same breath, to take action.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons for it -- to create this political symbol of you taking this action to jumpstart that debate.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think symbols by definition are not substantive -- that this has a substantive effect on federal contractors and those who make below $10.10 an hour.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no question -- and I think we stated clearly -- that our projections fall into a range of hundreds of thousands, not millions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not suggesting otherwise. \xc2\xa0But those are real people for whom this will mean a very positive change.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it demonstrates the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to do everything he can using his authority to advance an agenda that expands opportunity, that rewards hard work, that follows the basic principle that if you work full-time, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in poverty.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we have more work to do.\xc2\xa0 And in order to have every American benefit from placing that principle into law, we need Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to encourage states to take action, as many have, to raise state minimum wages.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to implement this executive order.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 There was a lengthy principals meeting here last week on that topic.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting in the aftermath that the administration has sort of come to the grudging conclusion that this BSA is not going to be signed by Karzai before the elections, and that it is important within the Pentagon and the larger NATO communications to reassess and begin planning for a post-2014 troop presence, because that is not going to be signed before April and you just have to accept that reality and move ahead.\xc2\xa0 Is that true?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think two things --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- shift in the conversation?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- two things are true.\xc2\xa0 And these are good questions.\xc2\xa0 Two things are true.\xc2\xa0 We continue to seek to conclude the bilateral security agreement.\xc2\xa0 We continue to press the Afghan government to sign the agreement.\xc2\xa0 We continue to make clear that absent a BSA signed, we cannot plan for U.S. or NATO troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014.\xc2\xa0 And planning has to take place around the contingencies that exist with either a signed BSA or a BSA that is not signed.\xc2\xa0 And as time progresses into this year, it becomes more difficult to plan for a post-2014 troop presence that would be there to focus on two missions absent a signed BSA.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the broader question, what is the Pentagon planning? I think you can take to the bank that the Pentagon is planning for more than one outcome, as they always do.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 But I guess the central question is, do the discussions now sort of fall into a category of assuming after the election this is going to be resolved and so the U.S. and its NATO partners can begin planning with that assumption?\xc2\xa0 That Karzai is the single impediment here and he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be on the stage and not going to be an impediment past --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t look at it as personality-based.\xc2\xa0 We can\'t -- this was an agreement negotiated with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 It was an agreement, and negotiated in good faith over a long period of time with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 It was an agreement that was endorsed by the loya jirga in Afghanistan, a significant milestone and hurdle cleared.\xc2\xa0 And it ought to be signed.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not renegotiating it, and we can\'t -- I think the answer to your question is I don\'t think that planners would start doing things based on the hope or prediction that a future government would take action.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think that\'s how this works.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is the Afghan government that negotiated this agreement.\xc2\xa0 There is the reality that this is -- we\'re now in February of 2014 and we\'re having to look at, with our NATO allies, what the world looks like in terms of our troops beyond 2014.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why it needs to be signed promptly if we\'re going to be able to fulfill our preferred approach here, which is to have a limited troop presence in order to continue to conduct CT operations and to train and support the Afghan security forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last one.\xc2\xa0 The Michael Sam story continues to generate a lot of comments on social media and elsewhere, and people are describing it as a significant moment not only for the NFL but sports in general.\xc2\xa0 When we asked this to you on Monday you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to the President.\xc2\xa0 One, I wonder if you\xe2\x80\x99ve had a chance to talk to the President about this, or if he\xe2\x80\x99s made any effort to reach out to Michael Sam.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have any details on the President\xe2\x80\x99s conversations or phone calls.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that I have spoken about this with him, and he, like the First Lady and like so many others, admires Michael Sam\xe2\x80\x99s courage and believes that the action he\xe2\x80\x99s taken is an important step, and looks forward to seeing him playing in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on health care, we\'re getting indications Secretary Sebelius may be announcing new enrollment numbers today.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sense of where the administration is?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 My understanding is enrollment numbers will become available.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure about the timing.\xc2\xa0 As has been the case in the past, what I am confident of is that after a very rocky start to healthcare.gov, we have seen a significant increase in enrollments, in signups, and we passed the 3 million mark, so I can predict that it will be above 3 million when the next figures are announced, and that we were seeing in December and January an increase in the demographic diversity of those who were enrolling, including a surge greater than the overall surge among younger enrollees.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So when it comes to predictions about how many people will have signed up come March 31st, I don\'t have an exact number.\xc2\xa0 CBO has made predictions.\xc2\xa0 What we are confident about is that that will be a large number, and it will be a population that is diverse enough to allow the marketplaces to function effectively.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you\xe2\x80\x99re saying there seems to be a surge in young people and the demographics are better, when we will see numbers beyond \xe2\x80\x9cenrollment,\xe2\x80\x9d see how many people are actually paying into the system?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, payments -- this is private insurance -- not often characterized in some quarters as that, but it is private insurance.\xc2\xa0 It is a contract between an individual or -- well, an individual even representing his or her family -- and a private insurance provider.\xc2\xa0 So insurance companies obviously have data about when those payments are made.\xc2\xa0 But this would be no different from any other insurance contract that you would purchase.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as far as what data or what information we have about those who have paid their premiums, I would refer you to CMS.\xc2\xa0 But it is important -- this is not -- again, when people like to talk about it as government health care, it is profoundly not that.\xc2\xa0 When people write that the law was crafted by Democrats alone, they forget that it was based on a Republican law entirely; enacted and signed into law by a Republican governor; modeled in part off of a proposal in the mid \xe2\x80\x9890s from a Republican senator.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s because it -- and as such, when you know that that\'s what it is, you\xe2\x80\x99re not surprised to learn that it\xe2\x80\x99s based on the private insurance market.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 Republicans are holding up a McKinsey &amp; Company study that suggests only about 11 percent of the enrollees are actually new people getting insurance, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of people who have moved plans or are renewing, and that a lot of the Medicaid recipients are not new Medicaid recipients.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any sense of the breakdown?\xc2\xa0 Is that study anywhere close in terms of --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that study.\xc2\xa0 I think there are several areas that fall into that question.\xc2\xa0 There are those who have enrolled through the marketplace, either the state-run marketplaces or the federally run marketplaces on behalf of the states.\xc2\xa0 And that figure is over 3 million.\xc2\xa0 It will continue to grow, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen steady growth in enrollments.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Separately, the 6.3 million individuals were determined eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP between October and December.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a figure cited often.\xc2\xa0 We have said all along that those numbers include both Medicaid and CHIP new eligibility determinations in states that expanded coverage.\xc2\xa0 In other words, individuals who are eligible because of that expansion, as well as determinations made based on prior law, and some states Medicaid renewals in groups not affected by the health care law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a mix there, and I don\'t know what the breakdown of that mix is, but what is absolutely true is that there is a significant number of new Medicaid and CHIP and enrollees because of the expansion in those states where Medicaid has been expanded under the Affordable Care Ac.\xc2\xa0 That number would be significantly larger if those hold-out Republican governors were to follow the lead of other Republican governors and expand Medicaid on behalf of their constituents.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 The Washington Post has a pretty tough editorial on the President\xe2\x80\x99s latest executive action on health care.\xc2\xa0 To be clear, they criticize Republicans at the beginning in saying that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be trying to gut the individual mandate.\xc2\xa0 They say that\'s a bad idea.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But \xe2\x80\x9cnone of that excuses President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly cavalier approach to picking and choosing how to enforce the law.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\'s The Washington Post editorial.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to the notion that this has been cavalier?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because this is a common-sense approach to phasing in an aspect of the law and its implementation for some employers.\xc2\xa0 Often not noted in reporting on this is that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 2 percent of employers when we talk about those employers with between 50 and 99 employees.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s 2 percent.\xc2\xa0 Ninety-six percent of employers in America are unaffected by the so-called employer mandate because they have 50 or fewer employees.\xc2\xa0 Those with more than 100, larger companies, are not affected by the moving of or the phasing in of the deadline over 2015 and 2016.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this phase-in is reflected by the phase-in you have for individuals, where the penalty -- if you can afford insurance, you don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for the hardship exemption, but choose not to buy it -- that penalty is phased in over several years.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, again, with 2 percent -- 2 percent of the employers in the country.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to just follow up quickly on Syria.\xc2\xa0 You said something in response to the question that you got earlier on McCain\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 You said the President believes he\xe2\x80\x99s got sort of the right policy right now.\xc2\xa0 And yet, yesterday, the President sounded as if he knows the policy is not working.\xc2\xa0 He said the situation on the ground is horrendous, acknowledging that Geneva is just -- the only good of Geneva is they showed up.\xc2\xa0 Other than that, nothing else.\xc2\xa0 Can you really classify this as the right policy if it\xe2\x80\x99s not working?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The right isn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I was trying to contrast that with those who I think honestly come by and support a different position, which involves in some cases the use of U.S. troops or other U.S. military assets.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not assigning that position to any specific individual.\xc2\xa0 There are obviously a broad range of opinions about the approach that should be taken in Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President readily acknowledges and did yesterday how difficult the situation continues to be in Syria, but he continues to believe that the only path out of that conflict is through a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 And as we press for progress on that front with our partners, we continue to be the leader in providing humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 We continue to press for a United Nations Security Council resolution to open up corridors for the provision of humanitarian aid.\xc2\xa0 We continue to call on Russia to stop blocking the passage of a United Nations Security Council Resolution that would achieve that -- because it is unfathomable to argue that you care about the welfare of the Syrian people and block a resolution that would ensure that humanitarian aid prevented Syrians from starving to death.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re pressing forward on all fronts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think that the point I was making -- and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify -- was not that the situation in Syria is not serious, but that when contrasted with an approach that might involve a U.S. military presence, for example, in Syria, or directly engaging in a civil war in Syria, the President believes this is the right approach.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you can\xe2\x80\x99t sit here and say that this approach is working right now, since it\xe2\x80\x99s not, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, this policy is not working.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I say that the Syrian civil war has ended?\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Can I say that the two sides have met for the first time?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s modest progress to be sure, with an emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9cmodest.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But it is an improvement over where we were a few weeks and months ago.\xc2\xa0 And, meanwhile, we continue to press for the ability to provide more direct humanitarian aid to Syrians, and we continue to --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President himself didn\xe2\x80\x99t sound confident yesterday that this policy is the right one, but he said at the same time he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe there\xe2\x80\x99s a military solution now.\xc2\xa0 And he said that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a military solution either.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like he is still searching for a better policy.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President reflected that this is an extremely difficult problem; that the path forward here is complicated and will be long, but that the only resolution here is through a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way this civil war is going to end and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re working with our partners.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pressing everybody involved in this to help bring that about.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to come easy, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on that, acknowledging that there may not be a better policy out there right now, certainly that there could be policies that would be worse, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to acknowledge that when it comes to easing the humanitarian crisis in Syria, that the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy has been an absolute failure?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you had the Director of National Intelligence tell Congress that the situation on the ground was an \xe2\x80\x9capocalyptic disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How can we look at the policy towards Syria as anything other than a failure?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, we provide more humanitarian aid to the Syrian people than any other nation on Earth.\xc2\xa0 And we are --</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s greatly admirable, but what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is in terms of ending the crisis within Syria.\xc2\xa0 The crisis has gotten worse.\xc2\xa0 Assad\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power has not weakened at all over the past year.\xc2\xa0 And we have our own top intelligence officer saying it\xe2\x80\x99s an \xe2\x80\x9capocalyptic disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 How is that anything but a failure?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The crisis in Syria is a crisis.\xc2\xa0 The circumstances on the ground are horrific.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have to bring the parties together to try to compel them towards a negotiated political settlement, because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a military solution here.\xc2\xa0 The Assad regime is not going to win militarily.\xc2\xa0 And the Assad -- the opposition, the Syrian people are not going to abide by a future in which Assad continue to govern them.\xc2\xa0 That creates a stalemate, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it has to be negotiated.\xc2\xa0 There has to be -- based on the Geneva principles, there has to be a negotiated political settlement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is no question that the circumstances on the ground are terrible and they are exacerbated by a failure of those countries who could help improve the humanitarian situation on the ground from taking action to do that through the United Nations Security Council.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to press for that kind of action.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to provide assistance to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to be the leader in providing humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask, while the French flags are flying, why is it that the President still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t nominated a U.S. ambassador to France?\xc2\xa0 I mean, that post has been vacant since November.\xc2\xa0 I assume he knew long before that, that the post was going to become vacant.\xc2\xa0 Why have we not nominated -- or why has he not nominated a U.S. ambassador to France?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m still being vetted.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, a serious question.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s an important post.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When the President has a nomination for that post we\xe2\x80\x99ll make an announcement.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will it be somebody who has donated or bundled or helped raise $500,000 or more for the Obama campaign?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, as you know, being a donor to the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign does not guarantee you a job in the administration but it does not prevent you from getting one.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is the President has made nominations to ambassadorial posts and other posts from the ranks of the private sector, from government service, and has put in place qualified nominees across the board.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer for you on that particular nomination.\xc2\xa0 When I do, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But more than half of the political appointees he has made to ambassadorial posts gave more than -- or bundled, helped raise more than $500,000 for his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 Is that a coincidence?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, the President takes an approach where he finds qualified nominees for these posts from a variety of walks of life.\xc2\xa0 And in that, he\xe2\x80\x99s not different from his predecessors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he promise it would be different than his predecessors on that point?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you that being a donor does not get you a job in this administration nor does it preclude you from getting one.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that some of our non-career Foreign Service ambassadors, like Ambassador Rivkin in France and Ambassador Roos in Japan, have been widely noted as enormously effective and successful in those jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 A budget question.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House support the military COLA bill that just passed, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s paid for by extending the sequester?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, the Defense Department spoke to this a few weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 And while we need to make some important reforms in this area, we are supportive of efforts to grandfather current recipients so they are not affected.\xc2\xa0 In addition to dealing with this issue, the President continues to urge congressional Republicans to stop blocking efforts to extend unemployment insurance to 1.6 million hardworking Americans.\xc2\xa0 So on this bill, it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the position that the DOD took a few weeks ago.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Scott.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Fresno.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about what he hopes to achieve there and what the administration is doing?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details on it.\xc2\xa0 I think as we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about a little bit in the past, the situation with the drought in California is quite serious and the President is concerned about it.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick question.\xc2\xa0 As you know, OFA is raffling off the President for the purpose of ginning up public, I guess, enthusiasm for enrollment in ACA.\xc2\xa0 Can you describe what the policy goal is that the President hopes to achieve by being the prize in OFA since he\xe2\x80\x99s no longer a candidate and we tended to think of them as a political organization but now they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to advocate for policy?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of it?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 To get people to enroll.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how does he being the prize, how does that help?</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I mean, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a broad array of efforts aimed at reaching people who are important to get enrolled, especially young people.\xc2\xa0 And there have been a range of efforts, some of them I think quite novel, that have been designed around that principle -- that calling on moms to tell their kids that they should do the right thing and get insured, that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 They may not be sick today but they could get sick tomorrow.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And so I think that -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not specifically familiar with this particular effort, but this is reflective of I think the kind of approach that\xe2\x80\x99s being taken to ensure that we get that information out there so that folks know this opportunity is available to them -- that quality, affordable health insurance is available in a way that it never has been before.\xc2\xa0 Because it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely important that we get not just a large number of people enrolled in the exchanges but that that mix of people is diverse and that there\xe2\x80\x99s a sizeable portion of young Americans as part of that group.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what the effort is about.</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>1:59 P.M.
