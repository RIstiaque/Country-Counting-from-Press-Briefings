PDT</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for joining us.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just have a brief announcement at the top that the President later today will deliver remarks at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College, where he will again call for our nation to rally around economic patriotism that says rather than protecting wasteful tax loopholes for a few at the top we should be investing in things like education and job training that grow the economy for everybody.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Specifically, the President will highlight the need to close one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most unfair tax loopholes that allows companies to avoid paying taxes here at home and will call on Congress to close it immediately.</p>\n<p>With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can you settle the question of what the President did last night at the hotel?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 As I mentioned yesterday, the President had a full day of events.\xc2\xa0 You were with him at each of them.\xc2\xa0 In fact, you filed 17 pool reports tracking each one of his movements.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Last night, the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any public events or leave the hotel.\xc2\xa0 If he had you would have been with him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he meeting with anyone for dinner?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t leave the hotel.\xc2\xa0 And if he would, you would have been with him.\xc2\xa0 And he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any public events.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s office put out a bit of prebuttal to the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech today.\xc2\xa0 They say that these companies aren\'t taking advantage of a tax loophole to move overseas.\xc2\xa0 They say it\'s not a loophole, but they\xe2\x80\x99re doing this because of the high tax rate.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 To quote Josh Earnest, I don\'t think that claim withstands scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 Right now, a few big corporations are shifting their residence for tax purposes outside the country to get out of paying taxes even though they keep their headquarters and most of their business inside the United States.\xc2\xa0 These transactions are known as inversions.\xc2\xa0 And the President today will call on Congress to take action to close this specific loophole immediately.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats are divided over whether to take action on inversions.\xc2\xa0 On Capitol Hill, we have reports saying that today. What is the White House going to do to convince members of their own party to take action?\xc2\xa0 How likely do you all think legislation is?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Sure, I\'d say a few things.\xc2\xa0 One, we support congressional proposals that have been proposed recently that would make the effective date for action retroactive to early May 2014, given the significant upsurge in activity in this area to date.</p>\n<p>As you know, Senators Wyden and Levin and Congressman Levin and Van Hollen have supported legislation to address this abuse of our tax system and make it retroactive.\xc2\xa0 The President today will call on Republicans in Congress to do what they did 10 years ago when the Republican-led Congress cracked down on corporations moving to offshore tax havens like the Cayman Islands and do it again.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll note that that happened in 2004 and signed into law by a Republican President.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President accept campaign contributions from companies or executives, companies that practice corporate inversions or complete those kinds of mergers?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President today is calling on Congress to close this tax loophole.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that there\xe2\x80\x99s any realistic chance of it happening, given the track record with Congress?\xc2\xa0 Or is this another thing that the President proposes and doesn\'t actually happen?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Isaac, you\xe2\x80\x99re so cynical.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I understand the basis for the cynicism, but we do believe that this, again, is an issue that has garnered bipartisan support in the past and we don\'t understand why it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t again this time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, apropos having a basis for cynicism, the reason we were pressing you yesterday and today about the President\xe2\x80\x99s plans last night is because the last time we did this, he had dinner with Jeffrey Katzenberg.\xc2\xa0 Is there a reason you can\'t just tell us what he did in his hotel, even though it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a pool movement that we were involved in?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, I understand the interest here.\xc2\xa0 Our obligation to you is to let you know when there is a public movement or even a private meeting you are often -- you often join us for.\xc2\xa0 There was no public events, and he stayed in the hotel after a long busy day last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- economic patriotism, is he suggesting that the CEOs that do these transactions are unpatriotic?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 We believe that this is a loophole -- let me back up.\xc2\xa0 The middle class in this country, the President believes, is the engine for economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that we should be supporting businesses and working people who contribute to that cause here at home.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why when companies are using loopholes to take advantage and reduce the tax base, we believe that should be something addressed; that should be something addressed immediately; that has garnered bipartisan support in the past from Democrats and Republicans, signed into law under a Republican President.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t see any reason why that can\'t happen again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he agree with Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s characterization that these are corporate citizenship scams?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have not spoken with the President about Senator Reid\xe2\x80\x99s statements on this.\xc2\xa0 But I do think the President has made clear these companies are essentially renouncing their American citizenship by shipping their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes, even as they benefit from all the advantage of being here in America.\xc2\xa0 That\'s precisely what we mean by economic patriotism.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any more on the meeting tomorrow with Central American leaders?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything you can tell us about what precisely the President is going to ask of them, and any development that might come out of that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of a future meeting yet, so as soon as we have more guidance on that, I will get that to you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, I just wanted to know about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s developing guidelines on corporate drones -- on privacy rights on drones -- can you talk a little bit about that?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I have seen that story, but, unfortunately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment right now for you.\xc2\xa0 What we have said on this issue in the past is that the interagency continues to develop and review policies concerning the domestic use of unmanned aircraft systems, and that remains that case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a quick sanctions question.\xc2\xa0 The EU is coming out with a sanctions list.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. going to add to that?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s your take on the EU sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Are they sufficiently severe?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Lisa.\xc2\xa0 We welcome reports that the EU is likely adding additional names to its sanctions list today, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any details for you at this moment.\xc2\xa0 We also understand they\xe2\x80\x99re continuing discussions to impose further, more significant measures.\xc2\xa0 I know those preparations continue for more robust measures.\xc2\xa0 We anticipate some of their names will overlap with those already sanctioned -- that we have already sanctioned, and we will look closely at that list when it comes out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Eric, can we go back to economic patriotism for a second?\xc2\xa0 Are companies that are not doing what the President wants here and people who are not supporting that legislation not economically patriotic?</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question, Isaac.\xc2\xa0 I would just again reiterate that when companies are renouncing their American citizenship by shipping their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in America that raises significant questions.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that can be addressed very quickly by Congress, as they did in 2004, again signed into law by a Republican President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what the administration is doing to make sure that the supplemental gets passed?\xc2\xa0 It sounds like some Republicans are saying the White House is not actually actively pursuing or working to get that passed.\xc2\xa0 And it sounds like it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen before the recess.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prognosticate, but I will tell you I take issue with the characterization that the White House isn\xe2\x80\x99t working aggressively on this.\xc2\xa0 We sent a letter a few weeks ago outlining our request.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a lot of concerns expressed by Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0 We hope that those concerns are backed up by action, because we need to surge resources to the border in order to address the problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen by the recess, will you guys transfer funds to cover the period until Congress returns to provide more resources?<br/>\n\tMR. SCHULTZ:\xc2\xa0 Again, our belief is that Congress must act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t10:42 A.M. PDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
