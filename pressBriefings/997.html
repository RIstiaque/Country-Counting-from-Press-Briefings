Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t10:26 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being with us for this off-camera gaggle, but on the record.\xc2\xa0 I have with me this morning, and I\xe2\x80\x99d like to start with him, Mr. Jeff Zients.\xc2\xa0 He is the Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget.\xc2\xa0 He is also the President\xe2\x80\x99s chief performance officer, the first ever chief performance officer.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has overseen the process, the review of -- the review that has led to the announcement this morning of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to request consolidation authority from Congress so that he can make our government more efficient and more effective for the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I will turn this over to Jeff, who will make a few remarks, take questions from you on this initiative.\xc2\xa0 And if you hold questions on other subjects until after Jeff leaves, I will remain and answer them, and then get you out of here in time for the 11:00.</p>\n<p>\n\tOkay, with that, I give you Mr. Zients.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Now, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d start just with a little bit of background, then as Jay said, open it up for questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tReally, since the very beginning of the administration, the President has been focused on making government more accountable -- getting rid of waste, saving money and making government services more responsive.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s really what companies across America have done:\xc2\xa0 increase productivity, save money, and improve service quality.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd as you know, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten rid of billions of dollars of unneeded real estate.\xc2\xa0 Contracting -- across the government total contracting actually decreased last fiscal year, fiscal year \xe2\x80\x9810, for the first time in 13 years.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve reduced those improper payments.\xc2\xa0 Those are the payments to the wrong people, the wrong place, the wrong time; those payments to people that are in jail.\xc2\xa0 As an example, they decreased by more than $20 billion.</p>\n<p>\n\tToday, the President is asking Congress to pass consolidation authority, which is a critical next step in our efforts to continue to streamline government, save money and improve government services.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe government we have is not the government we need.\xc2\xa0 The last major reorganization of the whole government was done more than a half century ago, led by Herbert Hoover.\xc2\xa0 Since then, agencies have been layered on top.\xc2\xa0 Rarely has an agency been downsized or eliminated.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve added incrementally over time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President is asking for the reinstatement of the same authority that presidents had, from Hoover through Reagan, for more than 50 years.\xc2\xa0 And that is to submit to Congress specific proposals for a fast-track up or down vote.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s an important distinction here, and that is that the consolidation authority requires any proposal save money and reduce the size of government.\xc2\xa0 Again, in the past, government has been added to incrementally.\xc2\xa0 Consolidation authority requires saving money and reducing the size of government.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe bottom line is that the President, like any chief executive, needs the ability to streamline and modernize operations, and save money and improve service.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will also announce today that his first proposal, under the consolidation authority, would be to consolidate six agencies focused on business and trade.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll run through those.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s the core business and trade components of the Department of Commerce.\xc2\xa0 Over half of the Commerce Department\xe2\x80\x99s budget is actually NOAA, so NOAA would move to the Interior Department.\xc2\xa0 But the core business and trade business components of the Department of Commerce -- along with SBA -- the Small Business Administration -- USTR, Ex-Im, OPIC and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency.\xc2\xa0 All six of those consolidated and integrated into one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe most important reason for doing this is to better serve businesses, especially its small businesses.\xc2\xa0 Today, when a small business is thinking about exporting for the first time, there are multiple websites, forms and applications.\xc2\xa0 The consolidated department will have one website, one telephone number and one mission:\xc2\xa0 to help American businesses succeed and make it much easier for small businesses to access government services.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we wait for Congress to act and pass consolidation authority, given the importance of small business to the economy, the President is elevating the Small Business Administration to his Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 The administrator, Karen Mills, will join the Cabinet.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that background, why don\xe2\x80\x99t I open it up for questions?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we start with Associated Press?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff, just on this larger issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s something a lot of the administrations have tried to do in the past, reorganize government, make government smaller.\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you have a window of opportunity here?\xc2\xa0 I mean why is this time different, I guess?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, first, as I said, for 50 years or so, presidents had this type of authority, so this is not new.\xc2\xa0 I think we would all agree we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point where we need to make sure that every taxpayer dollar is well spent.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan belief, and I think we can all believe that making government operations leaner, smarter, more efficient is essential.\xc2\xa0 And consolidation authority is a very important tool for ensuring that we achieve a smarter, leaner government.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What happens --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I called on Matt, if I could just -- let me just do this in order.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, the Republicans are already kind of scoffing at the idea of this being fairly modest relative to the size of the overall federal budget.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the President has presided over one of the largest expansions of government ever.\xc2\xa0 So in view of that attitude, in view of the gridlock in D.C., what makes the administration think that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to get the up or down -- the authority for up or down votes to come from this Congress?\xc2\xa0 And maybe Jay would weigh in on that, because it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a political question, too.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, presidents have enjoyed this authority for 50 years.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in time where we have to streamline government, make sure every dollar is well spent, improve the quality of government services.\xc2\xa0 The proposal that the President is outlining, which would be his first specific proposal, would be one of a series of proposals across time that collectively would save billions of dollars.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What was the political aspect of it?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, considering the gridlock in D.C., the in ability to move legislative projects past the Congress with Republican resistance, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking them to give the President somewhat of a carte blanche and move straight to the up or down vote without any kind of intermediary steps involving lawmakers.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, two points.\xc2\xa0 One, I think we do not share the pessimism about -- that others have expressed about an inability to get things through Congress.\xc2\xa0 We think this is the kind of thing that should have bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Republicans have expressed a desire to make government less costly, more efficient, more effective.\xc2\xa0 We agree with that assessment.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what this is designed to do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe consolidation authority would require, as Jeff said, that it would reduce costs overall, would save the federal government money.\xc2\xa0 That is something that we certainly would expect Republicans would want to agree to.\xc2\xa0 So every elected official in Washington has to explain to his or her constituents on this issue, as on others, why they oppose it, if they oppose it.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we, again, think this is very common sense, this very much what we need to make our government more efficient and more effective, and we look forward to working with Congress to get it done.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you clarify on the EPA?\xc2\xa0 I mean the SBA, sorry.\xc2\xa0 Moving it to a Cabinet agency requires what?\xc2\xa0 And nominating the administrator as a Cabinet Secretary means confirmation, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The President has the ability to designate his Cabinet, and the SBA will be now part of his Cabinet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it could get done?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just to clarify, so you would -- the President would lift the SBA into Cabinet status, but then with the consolidation authority eliminate the SBA as a separate agency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0 The SBA would be represented in the new agency by the secretary of the agency that is focused on business competitiveness.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a short timeframe.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We hope to get consolidation authority very quickly so we can begin to streamline government and save money and improve services.\xc2\xa0 The first specific proposal would be the one I outlined.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff, you just said the agency focused on business competiveness, is this going to be the Commerce -- I mean, is that going to be -- what is the --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the agency?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the name of the new agency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The name of the agency will be worked out through the process of submitting the specific proposal to Congress once we get the consolidation authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will John Bryson be the head of that department?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The President will decide once the new department is created who the secretary is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you effectively eliminating the Commerce Department?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re saying?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We are effectively taking the core business and trade components of Commerce and bringing those -- integrating those with the other five agencies that I mentioned in creating a new streamlined department that will save $3 billion and better serve businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other component of Commerce --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 NOAA --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 NOAA, which is more than 50 percent of the budget of Commerce, will go to the Interior Department.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s left of Commerce that goes into that?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What about the Census Department?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The Census will be part of the new department.\xc2\xa0 There will be a division of statistics, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics from the Labor Department will be integrated into the Census and the BEA for one economics statistics department, which will save money and help modernize our -- continue to modernize our statistics.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- hey, Laura, let me just -- okay, go Laura, and then let\xe2\x80\x99s get back to calling on people.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the new statistical agency would include the Census Bureau and the Labor Department statistics?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 And BEA, which is part of Commerce today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and any of the other government statistic agencies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s one component from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Commerce would cease to exist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Commerce would cease to exist?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 There will be one new department that integrates the six departments -- the six agencies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Which will be housed where?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 That will be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can you guys -- can we -- I just want to return to not just shouting questions and calling -- go ahead, Laura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If this proposal were to go through, would the SBA administrator remain in the Cabinet even though SBA would be part of the new agency?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 There would be one secretary of the new agency which is focused on small businesses, business and competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 That person will be part of the Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 Until then, given the importance of small business, the President has decided to put the Small Business Administration administrator on his Cabinet.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Kristen, then Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 How many -- I just heard you mention the $3 billion figure for savings.\xc2\xa0 How many jobs could potentially be lost under this reorganization?\xc2\xa0 And also, the President talked about doing this initially during his State of the Union address?\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about why now?\xc2\xa0 Why not put forth this type of proposal sooner?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The answer to the jobs component of it is 1,000 to 2,000, and that can be handled through attrition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is hard, important work, and we spent a lot of time out and about talking to businesses, particularly small businesses, hundreds of businesses, getting input on what works best and how can we make things work better, how can we streamline.\xc2\xa0 We spoke to the current heads of these agencies.\xc2\xa0 We solicited ideas from frontline employees through a website.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is based on a lot of work and analysis.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an important decision, and one that\xe2\x80\x99s well thought through, and it\xe2\x80\x99s driven by how do we best serve our customer in this situation, which are businesses, small, medium and large businesses; and at the same time, how do we save money.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 The 1,000 to 2,000 jobs, what percentage is that of the total payroll of those agencies as they exist right now?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s -- we can follow up with an exact number, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a few percent.\xc2\xa0 Few percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A few percent?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about cutting the total by roughly what?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s $3 billion over 10 years; on an FTE basis, it\xe2\x80\x99s a few percent.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how long does it take that attrition to do away with the number of jobs you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Across a couple of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple years.\xc2\xa0 And also, could you just explain the consolidation authority a little bit?\xc2\xa0 Where does it derive from?\xc2\xa0 What happened to it?\xc2\xa0 Why did it go away?\xc2\xa0 How did it work?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 It sunsetted under Reagan.\xc2\xa0 And again, what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here is reinstating something that existed for that 50-year period of time, but with a very important change or requirement, which is that we will save money, reduce the size of government.\xc2\xa0 The history of reorganization authority is that it was used more to add to government than it was to streamline or save money.\xc2\xa0 Consolidation authority requires saving money, streamlining government.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why even go and ask Congress for this authority, given the resistance that it\xe2\x80\x99s likely to face?\xc2\xa0 Why not instead -- wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t there be a way to figure out how to do this through a \xe2\x80\x9cWe Can\xe2\x80\x99t Wait\xe2\x80\x9d initiative?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing all we can.\xc2\xa0 To do this type of consolidation requires legislation, legislative authority to do it.\xc2\xa0 You can\xe2\x80\x99t do this through executive action.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the President, about 75 days ago -- because I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got 15 days left on our deadline -- ordered us, directed us to launch a one-stop website, which we will do in the next couple of weeks, which will allow small businesses finally to go to one website to understand the various services that different agencies can provide.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99re doing what we can do.\xc2\xa0 But to realize this cost savings, the $3 billion, and to integrate and create improved service, we need the authority and then the specific proposal for this new department to pass.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Dave.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This might be better for Jay, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 But in Hawaii a couple weeks ago you guys described the payroll tax cut as the final must-do legislation of sort of -- as we head into the rest of the year and possibly the election.\xc2\xa0 But would you add this to that?\xc2\xa0 And how would you describe how far the President is willing to go on this one to sort of engage in a real potential fight with Congress, or if they want to add their own --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 The payroll tax cut must be extended or else taxes will go up on 160 million Americans at just the wrong time.\xc2\xa0 We fully expect Congress to extend the payroll tax cut for the remainder of the calendar year, to extend unemployment insurance for the remainder of the calendar year, and to do so without drama, with political brinksmanship, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that, in the end, as it should have in the beginning, garnered broad bipartisan support.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a proactive initiative that the President is putting forward.\xc2\xa0 We absolutely, as Jeff said, hope that Congress will act very quickly to pass the consolidation authority, because Democrats and Republicans alike have a keen interest in making government more efficient and in doing what this specific authority would require, which is reducing the size of government and saving money.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we want this to happen as soon as possible.\xc2\xa0 It differs from the payroll tax cut in that it is absolutely essential that Americans\xe2\x80\x99 taxes -- 160 million Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t see their taxes go up on March 1st.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 One, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether this also reflects in any way a dissatisfaction with the way the Commerce Department functions as it\xe2\x80\x99s currently organized.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, is there any danger that by taking USTA and merging it into something else, you sort of make the trade agenda and the importance of reaching further trade deals or maybe even a global trade deal, you end up taking that position and appearing to diminish its importance?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Good question.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. Trade Representative will maintain his Cabinet status, and this will strengthen our trade enforcement, our trade promotion, our export promotion, our financing for exports by integrating them into one department.\xc2\xa0 So this strengthens our trade position.</p>\n<p>\n\tYour Commerce question, that\xe2\x80\x99s a structural issue.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Commerce does a great job with the set of services it provides, but if you take something like trade enforcement, their trade enforcement functions at several different agencies in addition to Commerce, so bringing them all together will make us more effective and save money across the board.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mike, and then Brianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, you said that this was the first major reorganization since -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, was it Hoover, or FDR?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Looked at the whole government, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you contrast that, though, with the reorganization that happened after 9/11 that created the Department of Homeland Security?\xc2\xa0 How is that different or more expansive?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Hoover commission looked at the whole of government.\xc2\xa0 Obviously DHS was a new department around a set of agencies and bureaus.\xc2\xa0 This is a new department that will be very integrated, that will save money, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to plan for in advance in terms of how we realize the cost savings and the efficiency gains and the service quality improvements.\xc2\xa0 And when I -- I guess just lifting up again, DHS was the creation of one new department; Hoover was a look across government.\xc2\xa0 Consolidation authority gives the President to submit specific proposals like the one he\xe2\x80\x99s outlining today that save money and improve service at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo once given consolidation authority, we anticipate this would be the first proposal, but there would be many thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A couple more for Jeff.\xc2\xa0 Yes, Lesley.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that the consolidation authority sunsetted under President Reagan.\xc2\xa0 Has any other President tried to reauthorize it since then, and what was the track record on them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 There have been some attempts -- we can get you more background -- I think President Bush -- obviously it has not been reinstated, and no one has positioned it as consolidation authority, which I think is essential in these times, that we do more with less, that we save money and improve services at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think that we can all -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a bipartisan issue, as Jay said, to streamline government, make sure every taxpayer dollar counts.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in time where we all can agree that the chief executive needs this authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 George, and then --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to make sure that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t misread your answer just now on USTR.\xc2\xa0 USTR would be in this new department but would retain Cabinet status?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be reporting to the new secretary of the --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Be reporting both -- it\xe2\x80\x99s similar to the U.N. ambassador, Susan Rice, in terms of reporting in to the Secretary of State and being part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet.\xc2\xa0 Similar here.\xc2\xa0 Part of the integration and making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re strengthening our trade and export strategies overall is that this be integrated into this new department at the same time the U.S. Trade Representative would maintain his or her Cabinet status.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is going to be the last one for Jeff.\xc2\xa0 Donovan.\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Brianna and then Donovan.\xc2\xa0 I did call on her before and then forget.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 So the umbrella, sort of asking for the congressional authority and then specific votes on different proposals, this being the first, will the other proposals -- I mean, how quickly do you plan -- is there going to be a series?\xc2\xa0 And will you be looking for things that have what you would argue should be bipartisan consensus like this specific one, or are we going to see other ones that might not be --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for terrains that are fragmented, inefficient, where we can achieve cost savings and service quality improvement simultaneously.\xc2\xa0 So once we get the consolidation authority, first we will be working to get the very specific proposal in the terrain of trade and competitiveness and business that I outlined.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to our next terrains, and again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking for areas where we\xe2\x80\x99re fragmented, inefficient, where streamlining can both save money, which will be a requirement, and improve service at the same time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is that the sole requirement, or is it something that you think you could get buy-in from Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Individual proposals.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s been partisan bickering over some of the proposals.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 You know, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s important that these be -- that you have the fast-track authority.\xc2\xa0 If not, you run into a lot of special interests, jurisdictional lines in Congress.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of resistance to this.\xc2\xa0 So having that fast-track authority, the consolidation authority is critical.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many proposals?\xc2\xa0 How many?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- every month?\xc2\xa0 Every --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s one step at a time.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are there several?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Hopefully that first step comes very quickly, we get consolidation authority.\xc2\xa0 Once we get it, we just outlined what the specific proposal -- what the outline of the specific proposal would be, it would be much more detailed at that point working together with our agencies to make sure that we have a plan that\xe2\x80\x99s fully integrated and that saves the money we talked about and provides better service.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And these are done, obviously, after careful review and consolidation that Jeff has led.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fast-track is to avoid some of that jurisdictional and special interest lobbying, basically?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 The fast-track authority is needed to get these hard things done, and to make sure that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get bogged down in amendments and special interests and all the rest.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Donovan, did you --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, mine is very bureaucratic.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any paper on this, on like -- you mentioned a lot of detailed things about this section.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 11:15 a.m., I\xe2\x80\x99m told, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have paper.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you be sending this up or asking Congress to develop it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Consolidation authority, the bill, will be sent up in short order --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When Congress returns from recess.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 In short order.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Last one, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take questions.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a few minutes until you guys have to go.\xc2\xa0 So if you have questions on other subjects -- is that a yes?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jeff, what are the costs associated with doing this consolidation with elevating SBA to Cabinet level?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is this --<br/>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no cost associated with elevating SBA to Cabinet level.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- consolidated departments, the DHS consolidation turned out to be very expensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Factored into our cost savings is this transition period of time where we can handle, through the current budgets, the transition.\xc2\xa0 And then the cost-saving kicks in, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the $3 billion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a lot of concern on the Hill about consolidation of presidential power.\xc2\xa0 I mean, given that you were actually able to establish a whole new agency and a Department of Homeland Security without this authority, why do you necessarily need this type of fast-track authority to do this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think the DHS was in a period of crisis, and it was the creation of something new.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about streamlining and saving money, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s always even more difficult to do.\xc2\xa0 And again -- and we don\xe2\x80\x99t see one opportunity to do this, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be multiple opportunities to do this.\xc2\xa0 Given the imperative that we save money and improve government services, we need this authority.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jeff.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. ZIENTS:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve got about five, six minutes on other subjects.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the New York Times piece this morning, has the administration directly told the Ayatollah that closing the Strait of Hormuz would provoke an American response?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have a number of ways to communicate our views to the Iranian government, and we have used those mechanisms regularly on a range of issues over the years.</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into the details of those communications or mechanisms, but any message that we have delivered -- and this goes to your question -- to the Iranian government would be the same as what we\xe2\x80\x99ve said publicly.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we obviously have means of communicating with the Iranian government.\xc2\xa0 We use those means and methods and -- but our message privately -- we deliver the same message in private that we deliver in public.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How serious does the administration take these threats?\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern that this may be tilting towards some sort of military action?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States and the international community have a strong interest in the free flow of commerce and freedom of navigation in all international waterways.\xc2\xa0 We have consistently communicated our views on that subject and concerns on those issues to the Iranians and to the international community broadly.</p>\n<p>\n\tI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the nature of this issue right now beyond saying that our views are clear, we\xe2\x80\x99re expressing them publicly and privately, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it at that.</p>\n<p>\n\tYes, Matt.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Myanmar freed 200 prisoners, and they promise to free more in amnesty.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. has said that freeing political prisoners was crucial to even considering the lifting of economic sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Will that process now get underway of giving consideration to --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have seen those reports, Matt, thank you for the question.\xc2\xa0 If true, that would be a positive development.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I have no new announcements with regard to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tJulianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just back to Iran.\xc2\xa0 So does that mean, then, that the White House does agree that -- with Panetta and other administration officials who have said that any disruption or closing of the Strait of Hormuz would be considered a red line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, without using -- I would refer you to the comments of the Secretary of Defense, but we are -- this would clearly be an issue because we have a strong interest in the free flow of commerce and freedom of navigation there and around the world.\xc2\xa0 And obviously that\xe2\x80\x99s a very important part of the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I can almost anticipate other questions about how we might react, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- we take no options off the table.\xc2\xa0 But we are engaged in the kinds of diplomatic efforts that you would expect in a situation like this and will continue to make our views on this known very clearly.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you won\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to call it a red line?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not that I won\xe2\x80\x99t, I\xe2\x80\x99m just -- he kind of outranks me on issues like these, so I would just point you to his comments.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do two more, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark.\xc2\xa0 And then Brianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any other announcements on Myanmar?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s your question?\xc2\xa0 Awesome.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any other -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question.\xc2\xa0 I might have forgotten an announcement.\xc2\xa0 But no, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Not at this time.\xc2\xa0 As I said to Matt, we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- these reports suggest a positive development.\xc2\xa0 It is the kind of development that we expressed -- that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear would be a good one if it were to take place.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll I\xe2\x80\x99m sure have more to say about it as things progress.</p>\n<p>\n\tBrianna.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a published excerpt of Michael Hastings\xe2\x80\x99s new book out that quotes a State Department official talking about President Obama during a visit to Iraq complaining about taking photos with soldiers.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if you\xe2\x80\x99re responding to that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I saw that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just -- I know from my time with him that there is nothing he would rather do than spend time with the men and women in the military.\xc2\xa0 And so I -- anonymous, unnamed, single sources saying something ridiculous like that, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put too much credibility in.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s all I have to say about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you all very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Coming shortly, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t11:07 A.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
