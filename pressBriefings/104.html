Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t12:54 P.M. EST<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Nice to see you all. \xc2\xa0I do not have any statements to make at the top, so we can go straight to your questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDarlene, do you want to start?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0There was a time \xe2\x80\x93- I wanted to ask about the economy. \xc2\xa0There was a time when, every month the jobs report would come out, and the President would have something to say about the numbers. \xc2\xa0Then he stopped doing that for a little while, and it seems now that he\xe2\x80\x99s resumed. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if you could explain why the resumption.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What continues to be true here is that we were mindful of the need to not be too disappointed when one set of jobs numbers fall short of expectations, and not get too excited when one set of jobs numbers exceeds expectations. \xc2\xa0But what we are focused on are the longer-term trends. \xc2\xa0And the longer-term trends were further cemented in this month\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers \xe2\x80\x93- 72 consecutive months of private-sector job growth; 14.3 million jobs created -- that is over the last two years. \xc2\xa0The fastest rate of job growth since the late 1990s. \xc2\xa0The longer-term trends when it comes to wage growth continued to be pretty good. \xc2\xa0I know wage growth is increasing \xe2\x80\x93- or wages are growing at about 2.5 percent a year. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good; it could be better. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly has some ideas for how to make that better.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think the reason that it seems particularly important to discuss it now is precisely for the reason that the President explained. \xc2\xa0And that simply is this: \xc2\xa0There is a vigorous political debate going on in the country, and the intensity of that debate will only increase as we get closer to the general election. \xc2\xa0And the debate in the general election will be focused on whether or not we build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years that have led to the longest consecutive streak of private-sector job growth in American history, or are we going to go back on that progress and are we going to the policies that actually led to the Great Recession. \xc2\xa0And the reason the President feels it\xe2\x80\x99s important to comment on this with increasing frequency is it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that we have made important progress. \xc2\xa0And there are a lot of ways to measure it. \xc2\xa0This is the measurement that tends to get the most attention, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason the President chose to discuss it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo will we get another good set of jobs numbers next month? \xc2\xa0Hopefully. \xc2\xa0Does that mean the President will necessarily talk about it? \xc2\xa0Not necessarily. \xc2\xa0But, look, this will be an important part of a discussion because, look, if people don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize that we have made progress, then it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be harder to make the case that we need to build on that progress. \xc2\xa0And it won\xe2\x80\x99t just be in reaction to release of information from the Department of Labor. \xc2\xa0This is certainly something that all of you who cover the President\xe2\x80\x99s fundraisers hear him talk about. \xc2\xa0And as the President becomes more engaged in the campaign across the country over the course of this year, I\xe2\x80\x99m confident this will be an important part of his stump speech.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s warming up for the campaign basically?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d say it quite that way. \xc2\xa0But I think the President is certainly pleased about the important progress that our country has made; that\xe2\x80\x99s borne out in the numbers. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t just mean the numbers that relate to the state of the economy in February of 2016. \xc2\xa0I mean, the longer-term trends point to important strength in our economy, and there is a fundamental question about whether or not we want to build on that progress or if we want to turn back to a set of policies that actually weakened our economy. \xc2\xa0That is a legitimate subject of political debate. \xc2\xa0Republicans obviously have their own ideas, the President just happens to think they\xe2\x80\x99re the wrong ones.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I also wanted to ask about Cuba. \xc2\xa0Secretary Kerry apparently has decided not to go \xe2\x80\x93- to make a stop in Cuba before the President arrives there later this month. \xc2\xa0Apparently there is still some disagreement with the Cubans over which political dissidents the President will be allowed to meet with. \xc2\xa0I was wondering if Secretary Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to go has any bearing in any way on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, because as Secretary Kerry testified before Congress a couple of weeks ago, he was considering a trip to Cuba. \xc2\xa0He had made no plan to follow through on it. \xc2\xa0Since then, Secretary Kerry has decided to travel with the President to Cuba in just a couple of weeks. \xc2\xa0On that trip, the President does intend to meet with some political dissidents inside of Cuba. \xc2\xa0The guest list for that meeting will be determined solely by the White House. \xc2\xa0There will not be any input from the Cuban government about the list of people who attend that meeting. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s no real dispute about this. \xc2\xa0I suspect that there\xe2\x80\x99s no real dispute about this because the\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAyesha.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On North Korea, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports that North Korea has told its military to be ready to maybe make a preemptive strike or even to use nuclear weapons. \xc2\xa0And this is coming after they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit with these additional sanctions. \xc2\xa0I mean, is it a concern that they\xe2\x80\x99re still engaging in this rhetoric, that they\xe2\x80\x99re still making these threats? \xc2\xa0Obviously, the sanctions are just starting, but is it a concern that they may not be changing their posture at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve often discussed in other contexts, where the United States in coordination with the international community has imposed sanctions against another country, our expectation is that that will not yield a change overnight. \xc2\xa0But over time, we have seen that increasing isolation does prompt some countries to reevaluate their strategy. \xc2\xa0Iran is, of course, the best example of that. \xc2\xa0There are some situations where we have seen that international isolation has had a tangible and increasing impact on a country\xe2\x80\x99s economy. \xc2\xa0Russia is a good example of that situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I think it is too soon to evaluate what impact the recently agreed-upon sanctions against North Korea has on the leaders of that country\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making. \xc2\xa0The fact is, as you pointed out in your question, the kinds of comments and provocative actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen out of Pyongyang in the last 36 hours or so are not new. \xc2\xa0And we continue to urge the North Korean regime to refrain from provocative actions and statements that tend to aggravate tensions. \xc2\xa0Instead, we believe they should focus on fulfilling their international obligations and commitments, particularly when it relates to their nuclear program. \xc2\xa0And that is not just the view of the United States, that\xe2\x80\x99s the view of the international community.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that will continue to be our posture moving forward, even as we implement a set of sanctions that are tougher than have ever been implemented against them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there concern that -- I mean, even though the rhetoric is not new, they have been doing more testing -- testing more equipment and things of that nature -- is there a concern about maybe eventually them following -- or being able to follow through on some of these threats? \xc2\xa0Are these threats that they\xe2\x80\x99re doing now, like, how much concern does -- or how seriously does the White House take the threats that they\xe2\x80\x99re making at this moment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the concern about the North Korean ballistic missile program and nuclear program should be evident based on the significant sanctions that were passed by the United Nations Security Council. \xc2\xa0I think that is an indication that the international community agrees that this is a subject of concern. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed a level of sanctions and inspections against them that have never been imposed against them before.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOur concern stems primarily from our need to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about steps that the administration has taken at the direction of President Obama to bolster the defenses of the United States in the face of threats that emanate from North Korea. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are ballistic missile defense systems that have been moved to the Asia Pacific region to protect the United States. \xc2\xa0There was a ballistic missile defense system that was moved to Alaska in 2014. \xc2\xa0There are ballistic missile warning radar systems that have been moved to Japan. \xc2\xa0There are a set of naval assets that are part of a ballistic missile defense constellation that have been moved to the Pacific. \xc2\xa0And that ramped-up presence there enhances the security not just of the United States but also of our partners and allies in the region, including countries like Japan and South Korea that are most likely to be in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we certainly take very seriously the responsibilities that we have to protect the security of our allies -- Japan and South Korea. \xc2\xa0We\'re going to continue to monitor the situation closely, and we\'re going to continue to call upon the North Korean government to avoid destabilizing actions and other provocations that tend to rattle an already jittery region of the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on Zika, the White House is planning to hold a summit on Zika in April to try to control the spread of the mosquitoes that would spread the disease. \xc2\xa0Can you talk a bit about why the White House has chosen to move ahead with this summit at this time, the main goals that you hope to accomplish out of that, and just kind of the outlook for Zika response at this point?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This summit is actually the result of a discussion at the National Governors Association Conference here at the White House a couple of weeks ago. \xc2\xa0The CDC will be hosting this conference in Atlanta on April 1st, and it will include representatives from state and local governments across the country, including many governors. \xc2\xa0And it is an opportunity for us to bring together these leaders from across the country with the foremost public health experts in the U.S. government to discuss what prudent steps should be taken to protect the American people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe administration has treated this as a top priority, and we certainly recognize that when confronted with risks like this, early action is important. \xc2\xa0And that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken the kinds of steps that we have already taken to try to get ahead of this situation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe most important of those steps, frankly, was putting forward a package to the United States Congress that would ensure that all of these activities that are necessary to protect the American people are adequately funded. \xc2\xa0And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Congress do anything with that proposed package.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd these -- our request is predicated on steps that are necessary to protect the American people, and it is necessary for Congress to take action to protect the American people. \xc2\xa0We\'re mindful of what the risks are. \xc2\xa0For most people, the Zika virus does not pose a risk, but it does pose a particularly acute risk -- potentially -- to pregnant women.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so an important part of this effort is a public education campaign. \xc2\xa0But there are resources that are necessary to ensure that our public health systems are adequately oriented to this threat. \xc2\xa0There is important work that can be done with what\xe2\x80\x99s called vector control to essentially try to prevent the spread of mosquitoes that we know carry the virus. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we need Congress to support that effort. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s important for Congress not to be asleep at the switch when we have a significant emerging threat.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDevon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Well, with Super Tuesday in the rearview mirror, we\'re sort of in a new phase in the campaign. \xc2\xa0And something struck with the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks today. \xc2\xa0He sort of had a few subtle jabs at Republicans and some candidates in what he was saying, specifically Donald Trump -- well, not so subtle in some cases. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But is he chomping at the bit to get back out there? \xc2\xa0How would you describe his interest level in getting into the mix right now?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s just mindful of the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s a general election ahead. \xc2\xa0And I think the President is certainly looking forward to having an opportunity to make the case in support of a successor who understands that we need to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made. \xc2\xa0And that makes him an important voice when the candidates on the Republican side of the aisle are suggesting policies that would actually roll back that progress.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd as somebody who has devoted a lot of his own sweat equity to the last seven years, and as somebody who loves this country, the President is somebody who feels like he\xe2\x80\x99s got a vested interest and is somebody who can make a pretty persuasive case in favor of a candidate that\'s committed to building on this progress.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you is, he seems eager to go right after the Republican frontrunner. \xc2\xa0Are we reading that right? \xc2\xa0He really seems to want to get back in the mix and not just defend his own record and support the Democratic nominee, but he really seems to want to take some swipes at the other side.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the President is quite focused on making a substantive case on the issues that are most important to the country and most important to the American people. \xc2\xa0And certainly the economy would fit that description. \xc2\xa0And having a substantive discussion about what sort of economic policies will allow us to continue the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made I think is a subject of legitimate discussion on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0And when it is, the President will be an eager participant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you about a development at the State Department today? \xc2\xa0Their IG has issued a final memo on the email practices of past and current Secretaries of State, and they claim pretty definitively that past Secretaries -- specifically Rice and Powell -- have handled classified material on unclassified systems. \xc2\xa0And basically, the bottom line is they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of moving towards making this case closed. \xc2\xa0And my question is, does the President, with respect to Secretary Clinton, consider this matter closed? \xc2\xa0Should the matter be closed with respect to her email situation?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m reluctant to weigh on directly on your question, because there is an ongoing independent investigation into this. \xc2\xa0And I certainly want to avoid even the appearance of trying to influence the outcome of that independent investigation by suggesting the President\xe2\x80\x99s view of how it should conclude. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo we\xe2\x80\x99ve all along been respectful of that ongoing independent investigation. \xc2\xa0And once that independent investigation is concluded, then that will be announced by the independent investigators who are performing it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And could you just -- in October, on \xe2\x80\x9c60 Minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s email arrangement endangered national security. \xc2\xa0Does he still, in the months since and what\xe2\x80\x99s come out, does he still share that view?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0His views on this haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed. \xc2\xa0But his views also include, as he noted in that interview, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing independent investigation that is led by independent investigators. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll follow the facts and they\xe2\x80\x99ll reach their own independent determination.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJustin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0First, I was wondering if you have any updates on the Supreme Court in any capacity -- the timing next week, what the President is doing over the weekend; if he or Brian or anyone is going to meet with candidates for the bench.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Just to manage expectations here, I would not at any point -- I do not at any point expect to be in a position to confirm any individual private meetings with potential candidates either at the staff level or the presidential level. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s what I can\xe2\x80\x99t talk about. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about what I can talk about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would expect that the President will have an opportunity to meet with his team before the end of the day today, and that will essentially -- to get some additional material that he can review over the weekend as he weighs this important decision. \xc2\xa0Obviously, there\xe2\x80\x99s been extensive consultation involved in this process with both Democrats and Republicans. \xc2\xa0I noted earlier this week that White House officials from the President on down have now been in touch with every office in the United States Senate to discuss the constitutional responsibility that the Senate has to fill this vacancy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not there will be additional calls over the weekend, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get an update for you on that early next week. \xc2\xa0But certainly the work to review relevant material about potential nominees is ongoing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President is expected to meet with financial regulators on Monday. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can preview that meeting at all but also talk about whether discussions on the fiduciary rule, which obviously is kind of getting close to being finalized, will be part of that discussion.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President is meeting with a number of federal independent financial regulators on Monday here at the White House. \xc2\xa0The President has done that periodically over the course of his presidency. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously quite respectful of the independent role that these regulators have to play, but there seems value in at least keeping an open line of communication from the White House to these regulators with periodic engagements like this one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good sense for you of exactly what\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda as it relates to the conflict of interest rule. \xc2\xa0I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s still going through the regulatory process. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of how soon it will emerge from that process, but I know that that process is ongoing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne of the key legacy achievements of this presidency will be the important reforms of Wall Street. \xc2\xa0And those reforms have led to a financial system that is more stable and ensures that taxpayers are not on the hook for bailing out financial institutions that make risky bets. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it so many times now over the last few years that it sort of sounds like a really easy thing, but the truth is, in implementing that law, administration regulators have had to fight tooth and nail with Wall Street institutions and their highly paid lobbyists to ensure that that law is effectively implemented.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the President also takes some pride in knowing that we were able to keep the promise that he made at the beginning, which is that we could impose greater regulations on Wall Street to make the system more stable, while at the same time not shutting down the dynamism of the U.S. economy. \xc2\xa0In fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking a lot about economic numbers in the context of this briefing. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m loath to talk about independent movements of the stock market because it fluctuates so wildly based on sometimes unknown forces. \xc2\xa0But the truth is, when you look at it over the last seven years, there may be no metric on which the economy has performed better than the significant growth of the financial indexes. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication -- it\xe2\x80\x99s just one piece of evidence that we have succeeded in both making our financial system safer and more stable, and less of a threat to middle-class families, while at the same time allowing Wall Street to perform an important function, which is to ensure that homeowners and business owners, small and large, have access to capital in a way that allows them to innovate and create jobs and grow our economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo all along, we saw immediately in the aftermath of Wall Street reform being passed, that this was something that was going to be really bad for the economy, and the numbers just don\xe2\x80\x99t bear that out. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one. \xc2\xa0On Prime Minister Trudeau\xe2\x80\x99s visit next week, the Canadian press is saying that the U.S. and Canada are negotiating an environmental climate package announced, talking about auto emissions, car technology, and also maybe a trade element having to do with Canadian lumber. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm that those discussions are going on, and if you have any detail or light that you can shed on it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been briefed on those reports. \xc2\xa0I haven\'t seen them firsthand. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of information to share about what\xe2\x80\x99s on the agenda for Prime Minister Trudeau\xe2\x80\x99s visit next week. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can get you some more information about that early next week that we can discuss. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI can tell you that in the first meeting that the President had with Prime Minister Trudeau during our trip to the Philippines last fall, it was clear that there were a number of issues where the United States and Canada very effectively cooperate. \xc2\xa0And countering climate change is an important one. \xc2\xa0Obviously, Prime Minister Trudeau dedicated a significant amount of time in his campaign on the campaign trail, talking about how the policies of the government in Canada needed to be and could be more effectively oriented to counter the threat from climate change. \xc2\xa0And he made a case quite similar to the case that the President has made, that the people of Canada and the economy of Canada can benefit from focusing on this in the short term. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd I think what that does mean is it means that there may be an opportunity for the United States and Canada to coordinate even more effectively our policies when it comes to fighting climate change. \xc2\xa0How much of a discussion that will be when Prime Minister Trudeau visits the White House next week is something that I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I can track down for you for next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tScott.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That meeting today with the staff on the Supreme Court, is that something he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing every day, or that is that sort of in the week check-in? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Periodically, the President has been meeting with members of his team who are working on this. \xc2\xa0Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s more formal than others, and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s just an opportunity to hand him some paper so that he can go do his homework, if you will. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to share about this particular meeting, but it certainly is an opportunity for the President to consult once again with his team prior to the weekend about the work that he\xe2\x80\x99s already done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0When we heard from the President today on the economy, it was almost as if he was framing the entire news in political terms. \xc2\xa0I mean, talking about it contrasts the Doomsday rhetoric. \xc2\xa0At one point, he even said that America is doing great right now. \xc2\xa0I mean, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the news stand on its own? \xc2\xa0Why did he feel the need to frame it that way?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it certainly seems to have attracted all of your attention. \xc2\xa0And I certainly welcome the opportunity to have a robust discussion of them. \xc2\xa0But, look, to your point, I think that these numbers do merit attention in on their own. \xc2\xa0In their own right, this is an important indication of the direction that the economy is headed and of the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly relevant to the ongoing political discussion in the country, and will be even more relevant in the fall when you have one candidate on the ballot, a Democrat -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Senator Sanders or Secretary Clinton -- making an aggressive case about how important it is for us to build on this progress. \xc2\xa0And they\xe2\x80\x99ll be matched up against a Republican candidate who is vowing to roll back that progress and roll back the policies that led to that progress. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an important debate for the country to have, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that the President is looking forward to engage in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But as much as you and the President himself has diminished that rhetoric out there and basically said it\xe2\x80\x99s hurting the country, you\xe2\x80\x99ve basically trashed a lot of what is said out there. \xc2\xa0So why does the President feel the need to respond directly to individual points in that rhetoric? \xc2\xa0Does that in a sense just give as much attention to the rhetoric as it does to the economic news that the President was announcing? \xc2\xa0I mean, he could have said, here\xe2\x80\x99s why this news is great for the economy and here\xe2\x80\x99s what it did. \xc2\xa0But no, he wanted to kind of match individual points in that news to individual things that Donald Trump has said. \xc2\xa0You know what I mean?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the -- given the colorful style of some of the Republican candidates, that they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten plenty of attention for their rhetoric talking down the economy. \xc2\xa0So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s little risk of inflating that attention even further. \xc2\xa0I think the benefit is that particularly when you have jobs numbers illustrating a much broader trend, that that warrants some attention too. \xc2\xa0And oftentimes, these kinds of positive economic reports include a whole set of pretty inconvenient facts for those who are getting the most attention. \xc2\xa0And the President felt it was worthwhile to point that out, as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I guess maybe a better way to frame the question and more simply is to say, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t the President get his own attention for these points without having it be political? \xc2\xa0I mean, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he have a -- you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about getting attention for this. \xc2\xa0Does the President have to bring in the Republican rhetoric to get the amount of attention that he wants for what he feels he has done?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, I think this has more to do with the fact that there is an active, roiling debate that\xe2\x80\x99s going on across the country and in newspapers and on your airwaves every day. \xc2\xa0And most of the attention is focused on the colorful candidates who are talking down the economy. \xc2\xa0And the President felt like this was a good opportunity to weigh in on other side with the facts. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wow, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to be asking this many questions about it, but now that we\xe2\x80\x99re on it -- (laughter) -- it almost seemed --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m pleasantly surprised.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It almost seemed as if he was maybe referring to, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, the debate that went on last night and was pretty colorful. \xc2\xa0So did he watch it? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President did not watch the debate last night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You know that for sure, he did not watch. \xc2\xa0And also -- I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask any more questions really. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, never mind. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m good. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Have a good weekend, Michelle. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Following up, was the economic reading on the schedule before this morning, or was only the photo-op in doubt?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team was meeting today to discuss a handful of economic issues. \xc2\xa0And the President dropped by that meeting to discuss a couple of them, and we decided to invite all of you in there to attend the President\xe2\x80\x99s drop-by and also give him an opportunity to speak with all of you about the good news from the report.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another subject, does the President have any misgivings that we overheard him talking about remaining in Washington after his term in office is over?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting way to ask the question. \xc2\xa0Not the way I expected you to. \xc2\xa0I did talk with the President earlier today about some of these reports. \xc2\xa0And look, the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach here -- you guys have all heard him talk about this to one extent or another over the last couple of years. \xc2\xa0And the President has previously noted the significant sacrifices that members of his family have made for him while he\xe2\x80\x99s been engaged in public service.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the truth is, he\xe2\x80\x99s reluctant to disrupt the high school career of his youngest daughter after having disrupted her education at least once before when they moved to Washington back in January of 2009. \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing definitive that\'s been decided here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, it sounded definitive. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s staying in Washington, right?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Or the Washington area.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing definitive that\'s been decided about where he or the family will live precisely. \xc2\xa0That\'s what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to convey here. \xc2\xa0But I think you get a good sense, based on the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments yesterday, about how he thinks about this.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, I think this is an opportunity for the President to, again, after having asked his family to make some sacrifices for him as a result of his demanding schedule and public service, that at this point he can be sure that the education of his youngest daughter is not disrupted once again.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there now a concern that the President will be inundated with real-estate offers? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m confident --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Have I got a house for you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet, right? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing the President and the First Lady will be able to handle it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are you remaining Washington after your term here? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Time will tell. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tKevin.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a realtor for you. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI just want to ask you about North Korea and sort of the complicated relationship that the U.S. has with China. \xc2\xa0How much pressure can the administration realistically put on Beijing to sort of rein in Pyongyang? \xc2\xa0And is it fair to suggest that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone so well, at least based on the last 36 hours? \xc2\xa0They seem to sort of just be doing what they\xe2\x80\x99ve always done, which is saber-rattle and threaten. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s your assessment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, my assessment is that the North Korean government understands how isolated they are. \xc2\xa0The set of sanctions that were imposed on North Korea by the United Nations were significantly stronger than the sanctions that had been imposed on them before. \xc2\xa0So this includes inspections of all cargo moving in and out of North Korea. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s an outright ban on small arms and other weapons. \xc2\xa0And it imposes broader sectoral sanctions on those aspects of the North Korean economy that do actually generate some revenue for the government. \xc2\xa0There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many that do. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the imposition of those sectoral sanctions is so significant.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious based on the way that we negotiated this so intensively with the Chinese that their support was going to be necessary for this to move forward. \xc2\xa0I think this is an indication that our diplomacy with China was quite effective in yielding a set of sanctions that will impose pressure on the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0The North Koreans themselves recognize this. \xc2\xa0And I think as a result, you see the kind of provocative rhetoric and behavior in response. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what is true is that it is not possible to judge overnight the impact of these sanctions. \xc2\xa0It will be over time that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to determine what impact they have on the strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s laid out by the North Korean government. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Let me follow on diplomacy. \xc2\xa0Do you think it would be more fruitful -- or a better way, how much more useful or impactful might it be to focus on Japan and South Korea applying more pressure on Pyongyang versus sort of working through Beijing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we have talked before that there\xe2\x80\x99s no government in the world that has more influence with the North Koreans than the Chinese. \xc2\xa0And that is why we have sought to gain leverage or to work with China to try to encourage them to use their leverage and influence with the North Koreans. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why having Chinese support for this set of sanctions is so critically important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, South Korea and Japan are close allies of the United States. \xc2\xa0So us being able to reach an agreement about what kinds of sanctions we should impose on North Korea requires some diplomacy but it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly complicated. \xc2\xa0When we\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with China, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more complicated. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the United States and China don\xe2\x80\x99t see eye to eye on everything. \xc2\xa0Fortunately, when it comes to North Korea, we see eye to eye on the most important things, including the fact that the Korean Peninsula should be denuclearized. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so that is why we have chosen what is admittedly a more difficult path to work closely with the Chinese to impose these sanctions. \xc2\xa0Because, frankly, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be more impactful if the Chinese go along. \xc2\xa0And, fortunately, they have. \xc2\xa0And they haven\xe2\x80\x99t just gone along -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States as we have led this international effort to impose these sanctions. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, time will tell whether or not it will have the desired effect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A couple more. \xc2\xa0And I know part of this will come from the Pentagon. \xc2\xa0Can you sort of give me a broad assessment of the movement of a carrier group into the area in the South China?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I can confirm that the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier group is in the vicinity of the South China Sea. \xc2\xa0I know that the Department of Defense made an announcement about this late in the day yesterday. \xc2\xa0This is part of the regular movement of that aircraft carrier group. \xc2\xa0It is not part of an ongoing freedom of navigation operation or anything like that, but rather part of the routine movement of U.S. naval assets through the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0The number of U.S. naval assets in the Asia Pacific region has increased significantly under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, so this is not an uncommon occurrence. \xc2\xa0But for more details about their mission, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to United States Pacific Command.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Last one, and this is sort of a Friday fun question. \xc2\xa0So the President will be binge-watching \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Cards\xe2\x80\x9d like the rest of us this weekend? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know the President has watched earlier seasons of \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Cards.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that will be part of his weekend plans this weekend or not. \xc2\xa0But I think there are a lot of people in Washington that are looking forward to spending some time in front of the television, watching \xe2\x80\x9cHouse of Cards\xe2\x80\x9d this weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, was the President watching cable news today? \xc2\xa0What was the reference to O.J. Simpson at the beginning of his remarks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is that prior to seeing all of you, the President had been in the Situation Room. \xc2\xa0He was actually -- (laughter) -- stick with me here. \xc2\xa0He was in the Situation Room; he was actually doing a secure video teleconference with President Ghani and CEO Abdullah of Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more formal readout of that meeting later this afternoon. \xc2\xa0But as the President was coming out of the conference room where they were conducting the video teleconference, there are a bank of television monitors right there as you walk out the door of the Situation Room. \xc2\xa0And the television monitors are regularly tuned to cable news, as I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Kevin and Michelle are pleased to hear. \xc2\xa0And so that\xe2\x80\x99s where the President saw that all of the networks were covering this bit of news.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He seemed bemused.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He did seem bemused, didn\xe2\x80\x99t he? \xc2\xa0Are you suggesting that you weren\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was shocked he even referenced it. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no, I mean bemused about the news that was being reported.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know where to begin on what I think of that. \xc2\xa0But you said you are going to have a readout of what he was discussing about Afghanistan?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a more formal readout on paper of the video teleconference with the Afghan leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On SCOTUS, you\xe2\x80\x99ve had obviously personal appeals by the President to Senate leadership, and now you have the Vice President having written this op-ed, making a very public appeal. \xc2\xa0Is the White House\xe2\x80\x99s view at this point that all of this is just falling on deaf ears, or is there any room to think that the conversation is moving forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, based on the reaction of at least some senators, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that the message is being heard. \xc2\xa0And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear that the public is hearing this message; that there now is ample public data to indicate that a strong majority of the country doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support the apparent initial reaction of Senate Republicans to put politics ahead of their constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make a case, both publicly and privately, directly to senators and directly to the public, that their constitutional duty should come first. \xc2\xa0The President is committed to putting his constitutional duty first. \xc2\xa0That will come before any political considerations that he makes. \xc2\xa0And we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll do the same. \xc2\xa0That certainly is what Vice President Biden did in 1988, as he alluded to in his op-ed. \xc2\xa0And we hope that Senate Republicans will do the same thing in 2016.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At a minimum, would ask or expect the Senate to at least meet with a nominee, even if they won\xe2\x80\x99t yet say if they\xe2\x80\x99ll give a hearing or reverse Mr. McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s position?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We certainly believe that they should do that. \xc2\xa0But those kinds of courtesy visits are a sign of a functioning, professional United States Senate. \xc2\xa0Refusing to meet with presidential appointees is inconsistent with longstanding tradition -- but look, so would be refusing to have a hearing and a vote. \xc2\xa0Since 1875, every single presidential nominee to the Supreme Court has gotten a hearing and/or a vote from the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0So this would be a stark break from longstanding tradition. \xc2\xa0And it also would be inconsistent with the expectations of the U.S. Constitution. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a strong case to make here, and we\'re going to keep making it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You\'re not at that point, though, of asking for them to meet with the nominee -- or with the candidate?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Once the President has put forward a nominee, that nominee will begin, as previous nominees have, begin making courtesy visit on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that those courtesy visits will include requests to meet with Republican senators. \xc2\xa0And it will be up to Republican senators to determine whether or not they will accept that invitation. \xc2\xa0I do feel confident that the Democrats will. \xc2\xa0And I would just note, in 1988 -- that was the last time we faced this situation -- you had a Republican President dealing with a Democratic majority in the United States Senate, and that was the last time that any President was asking the Senate to confirm his Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd Senators Grassley and McConnell know this because Senators Grassley and McConnell voted to confirm Justice Kennedy in 1988 in a presidential election year. \xc2\xa0So they certainly understand the stakes. \xc2\xa0They understand the tradition. \xc2\xa0And they understand the requirements of the United States Constitution. \xc2\xa0The question now is whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re going to follow it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And is it safe to say that the President has made some progress in his review and consideration of nominees?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It is safe to say that the President has been doing a lot of work on this. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to quantify exactly -- it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to discuss publicly how we would quantify that progress. \xc2\xa0But he\xe2\x80\x99s devoted significant time to this, and I know that there have been some sleepless nights on the part of his legal team making sure that he\xe2\x80\x99s got the materials that he needs. \xc2\xa0And that work is going to continue through the weekend.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tCarol.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There have been reports lately that -- one, that the President was -- or the administration is vetting someone, a judge in Iowa who had been supported by Chairman Grassley, and now potentially a relative of House Speaker Paul Ryan. \xc2\xa0Is there some directive given to the President\xe2\x80\x99s team to find people who have the closest possible ties to some of these top Republicans, or to make it as difficult as possible or as uncomfortable as possible for them to reject either the nominee itself or not hold any hearings?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t confirm that either of those individuals that have been publicly reported a number of times are part of the process.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re not denying it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to confirm and deny any individual candidates. \xc2\xa0What I can tell you, though, is I can tell you the instructions that the President has given his legal team. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty simple. \xc2\xa0The President has said, I want to find the best person for the job, and I want to evaluate this person based on their legal credentials. \xc2\xa0I want to evaluate this person based on their judicial temperament. \xc2\xa0I want to evaluate this person based on their life experience. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if this person is a Democrat or a Republican, I want the best person for the job. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what his legal team is trying to help him do. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to -- once the President has selected that person, it will be a little easier for me to be in a position to help you explain how he arrived at that decision. \xc2\xa0But as he\xe2\x80\x99s in the midst of that decision, it\xe2\x80\x99s just hard to discuss.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You just said a minute ago that there\xe2\x80\x99s ample data out there that suggests that the public sees it your way that the Senate should act, or the President should. \xc2\xa0But were you referring to something specific, or is it just anecdotal news reports? \xc2\xa0Or is there some --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s anecdotal. \xc2\xa0There are national polls, there are polls in individual states that indicate that a substantial majority of people who were surveyed in those polls believe that both the President and the United States Congress should fulfill their constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How aggressively is the -- or is the administration doing its own polling and its own analysis to try and gauge the public sentiment?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0This is not a decision that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be made based on polls. \xc2\xa0There are not names that are included in polls. \xc2\xa0There are not blind biographies that are --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This issue of whether -- of how the process should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go forward.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been clear since just a couple hours after Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s death was announced that the President intended to fulfill his constitutional duty. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s not -- fortunately, the Constitution is so clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s the only place we need to look for direction about what the President should do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last nomination process, how many people did he interview personally? \xc2\xa0Did you ever reveal that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\xe2\x80\x99ve revealed that. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve been asked that question before, but let me see if we can get you an answer to that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0If you can get a sense of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s one or two, or 10 or 20, or just where that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me see if that\xe2\x80\x99s information that we have revealed about past searches. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get into about this search at least until it\xe2\x80\x99s been completed, but let me see if I can get you some information about previous searches.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Because you said this search is going to be very similar to the last search.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, it will in that the President is evaluating the same kinds of criteria. \xc2\xa0And I guess the other reason to keep the searches at least similar is the last two searches yielded nominees that performed very well during the hearing, it yielded nominees that got bipartisan support in the United States Senate, and it\xe2\x80\x99s gotten two nominees that, even in their short time on the bench, have already demonstrated an ability to serve in that position with honor and distinction. \xc2\xa0And those are the kinds of goals we have in mind this time, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting out there suggesting that the nominee may play a more public role in trying to move this whole process forward. \xc2\xa0Is that a fair strategy to anticipate?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, there are some that have speculated that that would be a good strategy; there are some who have warned about the risks associated with that strategy. \xc2\xa0So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to tell. \xc2\xa0Obviously, people are entitled to their opinion. \xc2\xa0But that also is something that will be easier for us to discuss once the President has made a decision about who his nominee will be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\'re still -- and again, what is your guidance again as to what the time frame is from now? \xc2\xa0You had said I think before, just like the other situations. \xc2\xa0Can you say -- 24 hours, two weeks? \xc2\xa0There has been a number of things.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point I don\'t have additional timing guidance to share. \xc2\xa0I think the things that we have acknowledged is that the two previous vacancies -- that nominees for the two previous vacancies were announced about four or five weeks after those vacancies occurred. \xc2\xa0In his SCOTUSblog, the President noted that he would expect an announcement in a matter of weeks. \xc2\xa0But, unfortunately, I just don\'t have more specific guidance to share with you at this point.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get some more specific guidance before it happens, or it will just kind happen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My guess is it will probably just happen. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \xc2\xa0We will at least endeavor that all of you are in a position to report when it does happen.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0We\'re here all the time. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That\'s good. \xc2\xa0That\'s good. \xc2\xa0That\'s probably a wise choice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLaura.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Last night the debate was watched by Americans, but by people all over the world. \xc2\xa0And according to French TV, the candidates spent more time instead insulting each other than talking about Syria and problems all over the world. \xc2\xa0Is the President -- is the White House concerned about the degree of vulgarity we saw last night and the image we saw that America has now in the rest of the world with this type of debate? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think it was widely reported -- I assume overseas -- that most people concluded that the debate last night was a pretty bad night for Republicans. \xc2\xa0My observation was actually it was a pretty bad night for journalists -- primarily because I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve used up all the metaphors at this point. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ve got \xe2\x80\x9cdemolition derby\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cslow-motion train wreck\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdumpster fire,\xe2\x80\x9d and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t even gotten to the Republican convention yet. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So I wish you guys luck. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that when we get around to the general election, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a pretty clear choice. \xc2\xa0And there will be ample opportunity for the President to make the case that the Democratic nominee is the person who understands the challenges facing the country and understands the value of building on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made thus far.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a follow-up. \xc2\xa0Is the President concerned that Donald Trump can become the President of the United States?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The President has previously observed that he does not think that Donald Trump will become President of the United States. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But he might become the nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He might become the nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And that\'s a concern all over the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes. \xc2\xa0And the President has not weighed in on the horse race on the Republican side, but the President has been pretty resolute in his belief that Mr. Trump will not be the next President.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tGregory.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0I want to go back to the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0You mentioned again, for the umpteenth time, the Anthony Kennedy precedent in 1988. \xc2\xa0One name I haven\'t heard is that of Robert Bork, who, of course, was the nominee who was rejected by the Senate the previous year that led to the election-year confirmation. \xc2\xa0I went back and I read Vice President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s floor speech that\xe2\x80\x99s been often quoted. \xc2\xa0He actually cited the Bork nomination 41 times in that speech. \xc2\xa0And he argued that the problem with Bork was that President Reagan tried to remake the Court during a period of divided government. \xc2\xa0He said that the President, during a period of divided government, should moderate his choices for the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe public has not given either party a mandate to remake the Court into a body reflective of the strong vision of our respective philosophies, and both of our parties should finally, honestly admit to that fact.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIs the President willing to concede that, in an era of divided government, he does not have a mandate to remake the Supreme Court? \xc2\xa0And what are the lessons -- are there any lessons to be learned these many years later from the Bork nomination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think there is a -- well, let me start with the lessons first. \xc2\xa0I think there is an important lesson to be learned from the Bork nomination, which is that, at the time, then-Senator Biden was the chair of the Judiciary Committee and he presided over the hearings that Judge Bork participated in. \xc2\xa0And what\xe2\x80\x99s notable about the outcome is that Senator Biden presided over a confirmation hearing process even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t support the nominee. \xc2\xa0So it would have been easy for Vice President Biden -- then-Senator Biden -- to say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t support Judge Bork, we\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to have hearings. \xc2\xa0He could have said that. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s what Republicans are saying right now. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not what Senator Biden did. \xc2\xa0Senator Biden moved forward with hearings. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the irony of the difference here is that Republicans have taken the position that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to have hearings, even though the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t named who his nominee is. \xc2\xa0And one thing, Gregory, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be in a position to confirm potential nominees, but there was a Republican governor who has the strong support of Republicans in his state who was publicly considered -- or publicly discussed as being under consideration, and Republicans in the Senate said that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a hearing either. \xc2\xa0So I think it is an indication of just how starkly different the Republican approach in 2016 is from the Democratic approach in 1988.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ll make one other point about this, because I think this is relevant, too. \xc2\xa0So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that Vice President Biden -- then-Senator Biden -- presided over those hearings; he allowed a vote in the committee. \xc2\xa0And he voted against the nominee, but despite his opposition, he allowed that nomination to go to the floor of the United States Senate for the entire Senate to vote on. \xc2\xa0I think that does show a commitment to the functioning of the institution of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of commitment to functioning, to governing, that we expect Republicans to show. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s a little longer answer than I intended, but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that there are a lot of lessons out of the Bork nomination, and it underscores just how unreasonable the Republican position in 2016 is. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere was an earlier part to your question, though.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The earlier part was that the Vice President, then-Senator, in that speech, was arguing that a President should not be able to remake the Court in an era of divided government; that that situation necessarily calls for more moderate choices to be nominated. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think -- I read think a similar part of the speech, as well, which is that then-Senator Biden says that the White House should engage in aggressive consultation with the Senate, and if they do, that\xe2\x80\x99s when he would consider supporting that nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo again, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out hearings. \xc2\xa0He didn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out support prior to any nominee being put forward. \xc2\xa0He indicated, in fact, that, if there was a vacancy and there was a commitment to consultation and engagement from the White House, that he could envision a scenario where he could support the nominee. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty starkly different approach than Republicans have taken thus far, which is to say, under no circumstances will we support anybody that the President puts forward, and not only will we not support them, we\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to them a chance. We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to hold hearings, we\xe2\x80\x99re not even going to give them the courtesy of a visit. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just an unreasonable position. \xc2\xa0And I think that would explain some of the public data that I was referring to earlier that a lot of Americans understand that is not at all consistent with how the Senate should function. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that Republicans, after six or eight years in the minority, are having a hard time breaking the old habits of obstruction that are often wielded by the minority party.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWhen you take the majority in the United States Senate, you have a responsibility to govern. \xc2\xa0And thus far, Republicans have refused to embrace that responsibility.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I have a free speech question. \xc2\xa0The late Aaron Swartz, co-founder of Reddit, said that censorship had a meaning outside of government when private corporations either invent new kinds of speech or have a monopoly on certain places online. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s becoming very clear that Twitter and Facebook, in particular, are censoring and punishing conservative and libertarian points of view. \xc2\xa0The President has made some encouraging comments about free speech. \xc2\xa0He said, for example, that university students shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be coddled, perhaps suggesting that the safe space and trigger-warning culture isn\xe2\x80\x99t something he believes in. \xc2\xa0Is there anything the President can do to encourage Silicon Valley to remind them of the importance -- the critical importance of open, free speech in our society?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I appreciate the question. \xc2\xa0Obviously, part of what\xe2\x80\x99s built into our system is a respect for private companies to put in place their own policies. \xc2\xa0But I think the President would be the first one to observe that the success of that kind of social media and some of the social media tools is actually predicated on the idea of freedom of expression, and in fact, it allows -- many of these tools are so groundbreaking because they give people an opportunity to express themselves in ways that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t previously even imagine.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt also gives the average person the opportunity to be heard by the world. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes that kind of technology and those kinds of tools so remarkable. \xc2\xa0And, frankly, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what makes them so successful. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut, yes, as you point out, that is predicated on the important protection of First Amendment rights to self-expression.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He obviously can\xe2\x80\x99t enforce the First Amendment on private situations, but there seems to be a very clear trend. \xc2\xa0My verification check was taken away for making jokes about the wrong group of people. \xc2\xa0Conservative commentators and journalists are being punished, being suspended, having their tweets deleted by Twitter. \xc2\xa0Facebook is removing criticism of immigration in Europe. \xc2\xa0Are there any mechanisms that the government can use to remind these companies that they have that responsibility? \xc2\xa0Or do we just have to trust that the market is going to punish them if they don\xe2\x80\x99t?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure exactly what sort of government policy decision could have any influence on that. \xc2\xa0Obviously there is, though, a third branch of government, which is our courts; they are supposed to be insulated from politics. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be in a position to resolve those kinds of questions. So if there are private citizens who feel their constitutional rights are being violated in some way, that they do have an opportunity to address that before a judge in a court of law. \xc2\xa0And that should be the way our system works. \xc2\xa0But, again, even that is predicated on the idea that our court system is appropriately insulated from partisan politics.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s see here. \xc2\xa0Leslie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0I wanted --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to anticipate your question, Leslie.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yes, I know. \xc2\xa0I figured. \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back to Cuba. And obviously, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s cancellation raised some questions about whether the Havana government was going to be cooperative with the President meeting with dissidents and discussing human rights. \xc2\xa0And you had a quite strong statement that the White House will meet with whoever it wants to, that the guest list will be come up with by the White House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo I wanted to ask you, is the President planning -- does he want to meet a wide range of dissidents? \xc2\xa0And can you give any indication of in what sort of setting he wants to do this? \xc2\xa0Will it be a reception? \xc2\xa0Will he go anywhere to meet with dissidents? And will he meet with people who are not necessarily -- who are dissidents against the government but opposed to his new policy changes?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, all of the questions that you\'re asking are important ones. \xc2\xa0And the truth is the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule for Cuba is just not set yet. \xc2\xa0But as we develop that schedule and it comes into clearer focus, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to talk more clearly about where and when and how the President will interact with Cubans who are seeking to express their political views without being subject to intimidation or, in some cases, even incarceration. \xc2\xa0The President is interested in lifting up the importance of universal human rights and the importance of the government not just respecting but actually taking steps to protect the expression of human rights. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that will be a focal point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Cuba. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t have a sense at this point exactly how that interaction will take place. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously be interested in making sure you understand how that interaction takes place. And hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make sure that you get at least a little flavor of what that -- of how that interaction occurs.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOne other part of your question, in answering Darlene\xe2\x80\x99s first question, I pushed back strongly against the notion that somehow the Secretary Kerry cancelled a planned trip. \xc2\xa0The trip was not planned. \xc2\xa0It was something that was considered, but ultimately, once it became clear that Secretary Kerry would travel with the President to Cuba, a Secretary-level trip prior to the President\xe2\x80\x99s one was not viewed as necessary.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- sort of send a signal that their government is going to play hardball in the meeting with the dissidents?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Not really, because it\'s not going to have -- certainly the government is entitled to their opinion, but it\'s not going to have an impact on the decision that we make about with whom the President will meet. \xc2\xa0That\'s a decision that we\'ll make on our own without any sort of negotiation with the Cubans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJohn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you, Josh, confirm a meeting that the President may have within the next two weeks with King Salman of Saudi Arabia here at the White House?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m not aware of a meeting like that that\'s on the books. \xc2\xa0But let me take a look at it and see if we can give you some guidance. \xc2\xa0We certainly haven\'t announced anything like that and I haven\'t heard discussion about something like that coming up. \xc2\xa0But let me check.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on the Supreme Court, have you detected in your conversations with Republicans senators right now any daylight between Leader McConnell and Chairman Grassley on their approach to any nominee that the President puts forward?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I did see that Chairman Grassley did acknowledge that there\xe2\x80\x99s at least one nominee that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed publicly -- one potential nominee that\xe2\x80\x99s been discussed publicly that he would meet with. \xc2\xa0Now, I know he said that he would only meet with her in her capacity as an Iowan, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem consistent with the spirit of his previous declaration that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t meet with anybody that the President put forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIt sounds like we\xe2\x80\x99ve already found an exception. Maybe there will be others. \xc2\xa0Hopefully there will be others, because this is a longstanding Senate tradition. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to explain that to Chairman Grassley. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s been dealing with these issues for decades. \xc2\xa0He has probably hosted a dozen courtesy visits with Supreme Court nominees. \xc2\xa0So it would be a pretty stark reversal on his part, even based on his own personal career, to refuse that kind of meeting.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut my ultimate point here is Chairman Grassley understands that the stakes are significant, that he\xe2\x80\x99s got significant constitutional responsibilities, and that the recent precedent in the modern history of the Supreme Court is clear. \xc2\xa0And hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll be willing to abide by it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJC, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0Considering that Fidel Castro has lived through 11 Presidents, from Eisenhower to Barack Obama, might this administration, might the President, even for historical purposes, meet with the leader of Cuba?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0My understanding is it\xe2\x80\x99s not likely to end up on the schedule. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re still working through the schedule, and so if that changes we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you all know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get started on your weekend. \xc2\xa0On Monday --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, do you really think we start our weekend after -- (laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what goes on back there. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On behalf of my colleagues, we really don\xe2\x80\x99t. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I see. \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Well, hopefully you will soon get started on your weekend, then. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Monday, the President will host a meeting at the White House -- that Justin referenced -- with financial regulators to receive an update on the progress in implementing Wall Street reform, eight years after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. \xc2\xa0The participants will discuss efforts to continue to implement the strongest consumer financial protections in history that have afforded millions of hardworking Americans new protections from the kinds of abusive practices that predated the crisis. \xc2\xa0They will also update the President on their work to make our financial systems safer and stronger as well as present the kind of recklessness on Wall Street that we saw lead to devastation on Main Street.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the President will be here at the White House. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on his schedule for those two days, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Thursday, the President and First Lady will welcome the Right Honorable Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, and Mrs. Sophie Gr\xc3\xa9goire-Trudeau to the White House for an official visit with a state dinner. \xc2\xa0The visit will be an opportunity for the United States and Canada to deepen our bilateral relationship, which is one of the closest and most extensive in the world. \xc2\xa0That relationship is based on a shared history, common values, and a vast and intricate network of cultural, familial, and commercial ties. \xc2\xa0The visit is also intended to advance cooperation on important bilateral and multilateral issues, such as energy and climate change, national security, and the economy.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Friday, the President will travel to Austin, Texas to participate in South by Southwest Interactive. \xc2\xa0The President will sit down with the editor-in-chief of the Texas Tribune, Evan Smith, for a conversation about civic engagement in the 21st century. \xc2\xa0The audience for that discussion will be creators, early adopters and entrepreneurs who are defining the future of our increasingly connected lives.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President will call on the audience to apply their ideas and talents to make technology work for us, especially when it comes to tackling big challenges like increasing participation in the political process and fighting climate change. \xc2\xa0In the lead-up to the event, the Texas Tribune will also source questions for the discussion from its online audience. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAfterward, the President will attend DNC events in Austin. \xc2\xa0He will then travel to Dallas, Texas, where he will spend the night.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOn Saturday, the President will attend a DNC and DSCC event before returning to Washington that evening. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some additional details about the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Texas early next week.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo with that, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s still a couple hours away -- (laughter) -- but I hope you have a great weekend. \xc2\xa0See you guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
