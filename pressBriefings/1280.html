EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who are you looking at to replace Summers and how important is it to have someone who was in the business community before?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Look, let me say that -- as I said yesterday, look, the President is enormously grateful for the work that Larry and all the members of the economic team have done over the past many years -- or past two years.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think in many ways they probably fit four or five years worth of work into two years.\xc2\xa0 Larry and the President spoke last fall and Larry committed to staying through the end of this year, and then wants to, understandably, return to teaching and to his family at Harvard.\xc2\xa0 So, one, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re, again, enormously grateful for his work.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of replacements, that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Again, Larry is here for the next three months, through the end of the year.\xc2\xa0 I think the potential candidates that will -- that the White House will look at will be -- it will be a broad group of people representing a whole host of backgrounds.\xc2\xa0 I think there are a lot of things that the President will be looking for -- not just background.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is business experience one of them -- a CEO getting them into the fold?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a whole host of things.\xc2\xa0 Certainly that is -- that could be part of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does Anne Mulcahy -- is she a possibility?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, look, there are names that are out there that people are looking at, that people aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking at.\xc2\xa0 There are names that aren\xe2\x80\x99t out there that people are looking at.\xc2\xa0 We have three months to play the name game.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that this has been a while in the making, that the President knew about this, how much vetting has been done?\xc2\xa0 How far along is the process?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99re hugely deep into the process, but we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly not at the beginning of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you think the American people would look at this, or is there a concern about how the American people might look at this with Orszag and Romer, Summers -- they all have individual reasons for leaving, and, as you say, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a surprise -- but is there a narrative here of a White House that might need some new voices?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, look -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this many times, guys, and I think that for a number of people this has been two years of 15- or 16-hour days, seven days a week.\xc2\xa0 As Rahm sometimes jokes that if it\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday, there\xe2\x80\x99s just -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s Saturday, there\xe2\x80\x99s just two more full workdays until Monday.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re in the White House and you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with an issue as big as the economy is right now in the eyes of the American people, it\xe2\x80\x99s an all-consuming job.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that after 15 or 18 or 20 months, people are going to go -- want to go back to what they were doing before.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, the President is enormously grateful for their service and the sacrifices they made on behalf of the country.\xc2\xa0 I think there is no doubt -- and the President said this yesterday as it related to Larry -- that we are grateful for and better off for the ideas that Larry brought to -- into the administration for the economic team.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of Rahm, can you offer us anything firmer about his future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Only that he is, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before, in the process of thinking about what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do next.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s made any decisions.\xc2\xa0 The President is not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s made any decisions.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the process of him making an ultimate decision.</p>\n<p>\n\tI will say this, Ben.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something I get, obviously, asked about but it\xe2\x80\x99s not something takes up time in the West Wing.\xc2\xa0 Obviously Rahm is doing this in a process outside of the White House and is focused in the White House on his job as Chief of Staff, as we are on our tasks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the West Wing end of it, though, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to expect that if he is going to run for mayor, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to need some time to get on the ground and start working.\xc2\xa0 Are you preparing for the possibility that he\xe2\x80\x99ll leave this month, and how far along are you in looking at new candidates?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I got to just say this, that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nobody to replace right now.\xc2\xa0 If there is somebody to replace, we will be ready.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the Woodward book, or the excerpts from the Woodward book, what\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction?\xc2\xa0 It portrays him as constantly at war with his own military and trying to push back against their demand for more resources in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate portrait?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I hope people will read the book and not read what somebody might have thought was the book.\xc2\xa0 I read the book last night.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quick read.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, one night.\xc2\xa0 I will say I think that the book portrays a thoughtful, vigorous policy process that led us to a strategy that gives us the best chance at achieving our objectives and goals in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that any option that the President looked at would not have engendered some debate.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the nature of this process.\xc2\xa0 The process was, over the course of 12 or 13 meetings, a pretty public one.\xc2\xa0 And quite frankly, I think a lot of what you read about some of the back and forth is certainly well known.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI think if you -- well, I think again, if you -- and I hope people will read the whole book and see that we had a policy that -- and a situation in Afghanistan that had been neglected for seven years, that was badly under-resourced and desperately in need of new ideas and a new strategy.\xc2\xa0 And the President shepherded through a process, again, that was thoughtful and deliberate and focused to come up with what was our best chance at success.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think there was also a robust discussion about how important it is and in our national interest not to become involved in something in Afghanistan that was unlimited or open-ended.\xc2\xa0 The President is a strong believer and believes it is strongly in our national interest that if we\xe2\x80\x99re going to get into something like Afghanistan, we better have figured out how we are going to get out of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll of those things are important.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s what the book portrays.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the accuracy of one specific comment, which is that the President wanted to set a timeline on the war for fear of losing the Democratic Party?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- again, I think that\'s -- again, I hope people read the book.\xc2\xa0 It was in our -- it\xe2\x80\x99s in our national interest, as I said a minute ago, to ensure that we have -- if we have a way in, we have a way out.\xc2\xa0 We understand what happens when we only have a way in.\xc2\xa0 That\'s -- that leads to a long-term, open-ended, unlimited commitment of human resources and money that I think the book acknowledges we just don\'t have.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd without a doubt, you cannot have -- our operations in Afghanistan are, as you would expect, dependent on a Congress comprised of Democrats and Republicans that will fund the operations there and support among the public people -- among the people in the public to support the notion of disrupting and dismantling al Qaeda and its extremist allies.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him articulate those reasons for having a timeline, but we have not heard him say that one of the factors is the political risk that he stands for having a sustained war.\xc2\xa0 Did he actually say that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Ben, I encourage people to get the whole book and to read the whole book and understand that the President wasn\xe2\x80\x99t making a political argument.\xc2\xa0 The President was making an argument in our national interest that if we are -- we have watched empire after empire, if you will, get into Afghanistan without a way out.\xc2\xa0 The President was not going to repeat that exercise and hand to his successor a strategy that was as poorly conceived as the one we inherited when we got here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The story suggests that the President -- the story in the Post today suggests the President came up with his own plan because the military commanders didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a plan that he wanted.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think that having been through most of -- having been through all those meetings, there was a lot of discussion about resource levels.\xc2\xa0 I think if you get a -- if you read the book, the President is an advocate for getting those resources in faster than was presented to him, because the goal of the strategy was to break the momentum of the Taliban and to provide us, again, with the best chance that we had to succeed.\xc2\xa0 And the President believed the best way to do that was to get additional resources in there as quickly as possible once we decided on adding additional resources.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why, I think, you\'ll see quotes of the President suggesting that, again, we get folks in there faster and get a better chance of understanding and evaluating the strategy that we have and the success that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with that strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like you\xe2\x80\x99re saying the book paints a fair narrative of what happened.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in the book that you\xe2\x80\x99d contest or you contend with?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if I had my copy I might go through one or two things, or this page or that page.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the largest narrative of a robust policy process to determine the best strategy for our success in Afghanistan is -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s what played out in those meetings.\xc2\xa0 I think that is what you have seen all of those involved in that process agree to and implement since the President made his decision.\xc2\xa0 And I think this book tracks many of the articles that some of you wrote and all of you read about this process last fall and winter.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Rahm.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear you rule out Rahm leaving in October to go run for mayor in Chicago.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I can rule out that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to pitch for the White Sox.\xc2\xa0 I will say this, Steve.\xc2\xa0 Rahm has not, to my knowledge, made a decision or communicated a decision.\xc2\xa0 So based on the fact that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to rule anything in or anything out.\xc2\xa0 Again, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s in the process of thinking through what\xe2\x80\x99s best for Rahm.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to dedicate a new U.S. mission at the U.N.?\xc2\xa0 There was a report about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think there is -- I think that is one of the events.\xc2\xa0 I will go check on the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I think -- look, I think we are -- as we come here to our second U.N. General Assembly, I think the President will take this opportunity when he speaks tomorrow to update the American people and update the world on the priorities that we had in coming into office, the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in Iraq and Afghanistan, the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made on non-proliferation, in dealing with threats like North Korea and Iran, and I think a particular focus on the real opportunity that we have to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t3:44 P.M.
