Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:55 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Read any good books lately, anybody?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement at the top, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, actually.\xc2\xa0 Nedra.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that book, we got your statement last night, and clearly you disagree with the former Defense Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Vice President Joe Biden.\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99s someone who was in this Cabinet, and I wonder what weight Americans should give to his description of Joe Biden as someone who has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security matter?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would reiterate that the President and the rest of us here simply just disagree with that assessment.\xc2\xa0 As a senator and as a Vice President, Joe Biden has been one of the leading statesmen of his time, and he has been an excellent counselor and advisor to the President for the past five years.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s played a key role in every major national security and foreign policy debate and policy discussion in this administration, in this White House.\xc2\xa0 He played important roles obviously in the policy discussions and carrying-out of the policy decisions that the President made with regards to Iraq and in the policy deliberations over Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>The President has said many times that he greatly appreciates the advice and counsel the Vice President gives him on matters both domestic and foreign, and that is absolutely the case.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to Gates\xe2\x80\x99s charge that the White House is too controlling on national security issues, and brings micro-managing and meddling to a new level, in his words?\xc2\xa0 He said he almost considered resigning over it at one point.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s say a couple of things first -- that as we noted yesterday, the President greatly appreciates Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99s service to the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration and to the country.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Gates was part of a team here that helped bring about an end to the Iraq war; that helped decide upon and implement a far superior and improved policy in Afghanistan that was much more clear in its objectives and that had, as part of that policy, an end to a war, which was a clear policy objective of the President\xe2\x80\x99s and which we are implementing now.</p>\n<p>So when it comes to the internal interagency process, the President expects it to be robust and he expects to hear competing points of view from every member of his national security team.\xc2\xa0 A lot of you wrote about or talked about at the time that the President picked a team of rivals -- and when you pick a team of rivals, you do so in part because you expect competing points of view and competing opinions.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s very much what the President expects in foreign policy and domestic policy, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what he gets and he\xe2\x80\x99s grateful for it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Real quickly on the NSA meetings over here in the next couple of days.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of those?\xc2\xa0 Is the President informing these people who are coming to them what he\xe2\x80\x99s planning to do, or is he still collecting information from them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He is still in the process of deliberating over the Review Group\xe2\x80\x99s report and hearing from others on the issues that were raised in the Review Group\xe2\x80\x99s report -- because remember, the President\xe2\x80\x99s overall review includes not just the Review Group but the PCLOB and others involved in assessing how we gather our intelligence and what reforms we might make to the process.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99s at that stage still where he\xe2\x80\x99s listening and discussing with a variety of stakeholders these issues, and appreciates very much the opinions and counsel he\xe2\x80\x99s getting on these matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the comments in the book about Vice President Biden prompt the White House decision to let photographers into the lunch today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President and the Vice President have a standing weekly lunch.\xc2\xa0 When the Vice President is in town, he attends virtually all meetings that the President holds, especially on national security matters.\xc2\xa0 And as you know, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed this a lot at the end of last year, we have been committed to looking for ways to provide greater access for photographers to the White House and the President.\xc2\xa0 And providing a photo opportunity today was part of that commitment -- fulfilling that commitment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody who has covered us or knows the President and the Vice President, knows how this White House functions, has any doubt about the President\xe2\x80\x99s faith in Vice President Biden as an advisor and counselor.\xc2\xa0 So we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to reinforce that; it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the timing of the photo is just coincidence then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is -- it was coincidence.\xc2\xa0 He has a weekly lunch, so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll be back next week?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not normally on camera.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, exactly.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve had, as you could ask our friends in the world of photography here, debate and discussion with them about how we can better improve access for them.\xc2\xa0 This has been something that they\xe2\x80\x99ve raised with us in the past.\xc2\xa0 So you guys can decide for yourselves.\xc2\xa0 The President greatly values the counsel of the Vice President on matters foreign and domestic.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What would you think if you were sitting here, Jay?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the timing was a coincidence?\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously you and I had a back-and-forth about this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I can just tell you what the facts are.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you can decide for yourselves what you want to believe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about former advisors, former National Security Advisor Tom Donilon said yesterday that he probably would back the Keystone Pipeline if he were still advising the President.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that endorsement\xc2\xa0 -- what weight that endorsement would carry with the President as he sort of considers this issue going forward.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t discussed that report with the President.\xc2\xa0 The process, as you know, is ongoing, housed at the State Department in keeping with tradition of previous administrations for many years.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on that.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Looking at the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule today, I think I counted no fewer than four meetings on the public schedule with Vice President Biden.\xc2\xa0 Anything I should read into that?\xc2\xa0 Or --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I trust that you, Jon, and others who have covered this White House have looked at schedules before and know that every PDB when the Vice President is in town, every major national security meeting when the Vice President and President are both in town, the Vice President attends.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new about that.\xc2\xa0 The meetings today that have to do with NSA matters are ones the Vice President would of course attend if he\xe2\x80\x99s not traveling.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s how it works.\xc2\xa0 The lunch that the President has with the Vice President is one that he has had every week when they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in town since they took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we should expect that the photographers should be invited back in the next time they have lunch?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We make decisions based on requests and what we can make happen.\xc2\xa0 We committed to provide -- to find ways to try to provide better access for photographers.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working with them and look at ways that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 As I said back when we were having this discussion, there is no question that whatever we do will not be sufficient -- and I think this is an example of that -- but we will always endeavor to provide better access where we can.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What kind of a heads-up did Bob Gates give the White House about this book?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we knew Secretary Gates was writing a book, as everybody I think did, or most people did.\xc2\xa0 But we received the book last night.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last night?\xc2\xa0 And any concern that, I mean, here he is revealing blow-by-blow conversations, confidential conversations he had with the President and his other top national security advisors?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would say:\xc2\xa0 Anybody who has the privilege of serving in an administration at a high level and who participates in policy discussions and has confidential conversations with principals and presidents and then leaves office makes a decision about how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to talk or write about that experience and when.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s everybody\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make for himself or herself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would simply say that the President asked Secretary Gates, Robert Gates to stay on as Secretary of Defense, and he appreciates the service that he gave to this administration, to this President, and very much valued the role he played in this administration and the advice he gave.\xc2\xa0 For other issues, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to other folks to decide, because everyone makes their own decision in that circumstance.\xc2\xa0 Some people write books.\xc2\xa0 Some people don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re focused on all the things that we need to work on in 2014, both national security matters, domestic matters, economic matters, matters of providing essential emergency assistance to the uninsured -- I mean the unemployed.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what consumes our days.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 At his farewell, the President said of Secretary Gates, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite simply, he is one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s finest public servants.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in this deluge of confidential information that he\xe2\x80\x99s put out and judgments that he\xe2\x80\x99s made about the President and Vice President that causes the President to reconsider that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think I answered part of that just now in terms of how the decisions folks make when they leave administrations -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s true of this or any other previous administration.\xc2\xa0 What matters most to the President is the service that his top advisors give him as President, and Secretary Gates provided service to this administration and to previous administrations, and the President is greatly appreciative of that.</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note, because you see headlines and you see discrete excerpts that tell a story, or one story, or seem to say one thing, but since a lot of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here has to do with the policy review over Afghanistan and Pakistan, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that in -- or not remember; maybe some of you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been noted in some of the press reports that regarding that policy debate, in his book, Secretary Gates said, \xe2\x80\x9cObama was much criticized by conservatives and hawkish commentators for announcing that the troop surge in Afghanistan would begin to be drawn down in July 2011 and that all U.S. combat troops would be withdrawn and all responsibility for security transferred to the Afghans by the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 Inside the military there was also much grumbling about the numerical limits he placed on troops.\xc2\xa0 I believe Obama was right in each of these decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s from the book.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99s published opinion on these matters.</p>\n<p>Were these substantial, rich discussions?\xc2\xa0 Absolutely, because the policy was so important.\xc2\xa0 And it was much reported on at the time that there were differing views about how we should move forward with our policy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 So some of those disagreements or differing views, the reporting here is not different from what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, Jay, these are some explosive statements that he has made about the President.\xc2\xa0 This is not some outside critic; this was one of his most important, if not most important national security advisor, the guy he chose to keep on to run the Pentagon.\xc2\xa0 And he says that there was a \xe2\x80\x9csuspicion and distrust of senior military officers by senior White House officials, including the President and the Vice President,\xe2\x80\x9d and that this became a big problem for him.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what do you say --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I just read to you -- again, you have to take the full picture here, Jon.\xc2\xa0 And I would say on that matter, I think the American people expect that their Commander-in-Chief listen to all of his advisors, civilian and military, when it comes to discussions and debates about matters of war and peace and decisions that affect the lives of our men and women in uniform.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s how it should be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President, the Vice President, everyone in this building who has ever served and worked on these matters has enormous respect for our men and women in uniform, and that includes all of the President\xe2\x80\x99s top senior military advisors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On policy issues, the President absolutely wants tough questions asked.\xc2\xa0 On matters of national security, he wants, in these discussions and debates, both his military and his civilian advisors to be blunt and candid about their views and to back up their assessments.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what you, I think, would expect and want in the kinds of discussions that are held and have been held in previous administrations and previous White Houses, hopefully, when these fateful decisions have to be made.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, was Gates wrong when he said that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in his own Afghanistan policy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it is absolutely the case, as many have reported, that it is well known that the President has been committed to achieving the mission of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda while also ensuring that we have a clear path for winding down the war, which will end this year.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are not separate issues.\xc2\xa0 The mission and the policy included both ramping up and refocusing our mission on al Qaeda as well as making sure we had a policy in place that would wind down that war, because a war without end was not what the President believed was the right policy.</p>\n<p>And there were debates about this.\xc2\xa0 So the President believes thoroughly in the mission.\xc2\xa0 He knows it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, but he believes that our men and women in uniform as well as those civilians in Afghanistan, and others who are working on this issue, have admirably and heroically fulfilled that mission.\xc2\xa0 And they do so today.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on the inference that Secretary Gates has in the book that both Secretary Clinton and President Obama admitted their opposition to the Iraq surge, that politics played a role in the Iraq mission -- the Iraq surge?\xc2\xa0 It was mostly directed -- there was an inference here that the President also was engaging in this discussion.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I don\'t understand about that is anybody who has covered Barack Obama, going all the way back to his race for the Senate, knows that he was opposed to the Iraq war.\xc2\xa0 That was his view running for the Senate; it was his view as a senator; it was his view as a candidate for the presidency.\xc2\xa0 So it would be entirely inconsistent for him not to hold the position that he held with regards to the surge.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what conversation that refers to, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t track based on what I know and everybody here knows about the President\'s positions through the years, going back to 2002, on these matters.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You have a very real deadline coming up with the Afghanistan government having to do with the decision to keep troops -- what size of force, if any, is there after 2014.\xc2\xa0 Is there a concern by the President that some of the revelations about the President\'s personal views of Karzai, for instance, is going to make this more difficult.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 Look, I think that the issues on the table here have to do with the need for the Afghan government to sign the bilateral security agreement, as was envisioned by President Karzai and others, which is a product of the BSA, a good-faith negotiation.\xc2\xa0 And in order for the United States and our allies to plan for a post-2014 mission that would have a military component to it focused on counterterrorism and support and training for Afghan troops, we need this agreement signed promptly.\xc2\xa0 And this is a matter, as I said the other day, of weeks not months.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re not concerned that this book sort of breeds more tension with Karzai?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have direct and regular communications both from Washington and our embassy in Kabul with President Karzai and his government.\xc2\xa0 And I think these matters are well far along the road, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that.\xc2\xa0 He and his government understands our views and our position and the reasoning behind it.\xc2\xa0 And we simply urge prompt action on signing the BSA.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was Secretary Gates\'s characterization of the President\'s views of Karzai accurate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think President Obama has addressed our policy towards Afghanistan, our relationship with President Karzai.\xc2\xa0 That government and President Karzai, they obviously are in -- it\'s a challenging situation every day for them, and we work with them every day both through our military and our civilian force there to help them prepare for this transition and to help them in a military way prepare for the increased responsibility for security that comes with it.\xc2\xa0 That has been a clear focus of the mission that the President established after the review of our policy there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the description was pretty personal:\xc2\xa0 the President can\'t stand Karzai.\xc2\xa0 Is that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily agree -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that.\xc2\xa0 And I think the issues here are not about personalities, they\'re about policies.\xc2\xa0 And the decisions the President makes about sending and keeping military forces, American men and women in uniform, in Afghanistan have to do with U.S. national security interests, not those kinds of issues.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the signing of the BSA is so important for us and our NATO allies to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to Biden, this is the second book in three months where the President is basically -- in some way you guys have come out and had this sort of defend, buck up, whatever you want to describe it, when it comes to Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s place.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think it is that Biden has been derided negatively in a couple of these books?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I would agree with that assessment.\xc2\xa0 When asked, we and the President and others simply reassert the fundamental fact here, which is that Vice President Biden is a key advisor on national security matters and domestic policy matters and other matters for this President.\xc2\xa0 And the President greatly values the counsel he provides.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just the fact.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact known to everyone in this building every day --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do insiders seem to portray him in these books --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think when it comes to debates internally the Vice President was one member and continues to be one member of that team of rivals.\xc2\xa0 This is not somebody who the President chose to be someone who simply affirms what others are thinking.</p>\n<p>The Vice President has a lot of experience.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President has done a lot of work on a lot of very complex issues, including Afghanistan and Iraq, including a number of domestic policy issues.\xc2\xa0 And he plays an important role in the discussions here, and that role includes expressing an opinion that isn\xe2\x80\x99t always agreed to by everybody in the room.\xc2\xa0 And if it were, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be what the President wanted.</p>\n<p>Let me move up and back.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi.\xc2\xa0 Different subject altogether.\xc2\xa0 This morning, at the U.S. Chamber, Tom Donohue was talking about the state of business, and he said one of businesses biggest concerns right now is overregulation.\xc2\xa0 He accuses this administration of regulatory overreach.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied with the level of regulation on businesses?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things about that.\xc2\xa0 The President does not believe that we have to choose between protecting the health, welfare, and safety of Americans, and promoting economic growth, job creation, competitiveness, and innovation.\xc2\xa0 We can do both and we are doing both.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The net benefits of rules finalized through the fourth fiscal year of this administration were $159 billion; that\xe2\x80\x99s the net benefits.\xc2\xa0 This is almost four times the net benefits through the fourth fiscal year of the previous administration.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Obama administration has had a smart, pragmatic approach to ensure we are reducing burdensome regulations.\xc2\xa0 We continue to make significant progress in the President\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented regulatory retrospective review, or regulatory look-back initiative, where we are streamlining, modifying or repealing regulations to reduce unnecessary burdens and costs.\xc2\xa0 Federal agencies have issued look-back plans detailing over 500 initiatives that will reduce costs, simplify the regulatory system, and eliminate redundancy and inconsistency.\xc2\xa0 And this effort is already on track to save more than $10 billion in regulatory costs in the near term, with more savings to come.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the broader issues, look, when it comes to helping our businesses grow, helping them create jobs, we are absolutely committed to working with the Chamber and the businesses the Chamber represents, and with members of Congress in both parties on ways that we can do that.\xc2\xa0 Further economic growth and the kind of economic growth that creates jobs that middle-class families can depend on and save money for retirement and for college on, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re about, and we want to work with everyone on that.\xc2\xa0 And we just simply don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with assertions that you need to sacrifice the quality of the water our kids drink, or the air they breathe, in order to achieve that.\xc2\xa0 We can do both.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to something that Jonathan asked.\xc2\xa0 You said that the President -- well, you said that the White House received the book last night.\xc2\xa0 Who received the book?\xc2\xa0 And did the President get a copy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who else has gotten a copy; I got a copy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And did you disperse that amongst the White House?\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s reading it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Others have looked at it.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the time to look at it yet.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And what message does it send to the troops when in this book Gates is talking about how the President was skeptical, if not convinced, that his strategy in Afghanistan would fail?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve had so many people die, so many people wounded in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 I mean, what does this send to the troops?\xc2\xa0 This is your man of war, your former man of war.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, as I was saying, it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that the President is committed to the mission that he has asked our men and women in the military to perform in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And one of the principles that underlies the policy decision-making process that this President engages in when it comes to these kinds of issues is that we need to -- when we decide to send -- when he decides to send our military into harm\'s way, we need to have a clear mission.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as you know, and everybody here who covered it knows, when President Obama came into office, we inherited a policy in Afghanistan that was in disarray by the judgment of many people on the outside and inside, Republicans and Democrats alike.\xc2\xa0 I think it was -- something said at the time that when you went to Afghanistan and talked to our civilian and military leaders at the end of 2008, early 2009 and asked them what the mission was, and you talked to maybe five or ten different people, you got five or ten different answers.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this President, as you know, when he campaigned for President, made clear that he felt that we needed to refocus as a nation on the effort in Afghanistan; that the effort in Iraq had been -- which the President had opposed -- had resulted in the United States taking its focus off of the wholly necessary mission to disrupt, dismantle and ultimately defeat al Qaeda core in Afghanistan in the Af-Pak region.</p>\n<p>So that was what that policy review was all about -- was producing clarity for our troops and for every American who cared deeply about the fact that we had tens of thousands of troops -- more than 100,000 troops combined in Afghanistan and Iraq.\xc2\xa0 They deserved the clarity that the President\'s policy, which he devised with Secretary Gates and other members of his national security team -- and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he went about doing it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If he had a chance to talk to Secretary Gates right now -- if the President had a chance to talk to him, what would he say?\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are some strong accusations in this book.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, April, I think -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate, but I think our response about the President\'s appreciation for Bob Gates\'s service reflects what the President feels and what we all feel.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the fact that there have been -- that there were some debates in the prolonged policy review over Afghanistan is hardly news.\xc2\xa0 But that process led to a stronger, better policy for our troops and for our national security because it was focused on what the original purpose of going to Afghanistan was about, which was holding responsible those who attacked the United States and killed Americans on September 11th, 2001, and assisting the new Afghan government and the Afghan security forces and helping build them up so that they could eventually be responsible for their own security.\xc2\xa0 Because it was not the President\'s view -- in fact, it was his stated commitment that he would not endorse a policy that foresaw war in Afghanistan without end.\xc2\xa0 He thought it was very important to ensure that we had a withdrawal date; that even after we surged our forces as part of refocusing the mission and bringing pressure on al Qaeda central, that we would also begin the drawdown -- or after that, begin the drawdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that is the commitment he has made and it is the commitment he\'s keeping.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s what the American people expected him to do, he said he would do and he has done.\xc2\xa0 And that applies to Iraq, as well.</p>\n<p>Brianna.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 So when you say that the President thoroughly believed in the mission in the surge in Afghanistan, when Secretary Gates says that Obama was "skeptical if not outright convinced it would fail," about sending 30,000 more troops in, are you saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m saying that the President devised the mission and has great faith in the troops who carry out the mission and in the mission itself -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s the right mission to pursue in Afghanistan, it has been.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s been borne out.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it\xe2\x80\x99s not a challenge.\xc2\xa0 Of course, it is.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why these debates were so --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So Bob Gates is mistaken in his assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You guys can assess the lines -- each line in the book.\xc2\xa0 I\'m simply telling you --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, but you\xe2\x80\x99re in a position obviously to assess it better than we are.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m telling you what the President believes and I think what has been demonstrated again and again by his policy decisions and his statements on these issues.\xc2\xa0 The President oversaw a process to review our policy in Afghanistan and in the Af-Pak region precisely because the circumstances with regards to that policy when he took office were in disarray.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was attested to by many people.\xc2\xa0 There was a need to refocus our strategy in Afghanistan to -- I think Secretary Gates says this -- again, I haven\'t read the book but I\'ve read some accounts of it -- says this somewhere that it was a good thing to do -- one of the right decisions that Secretary Gates talks about the President making on Afghanistan -- to narrow the mission, refocus it, make sure that it was clear to our troops and our civilian leaders and our military commanders what the mission was, because we owe that to them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very serious charge to say that President Obama was sending 30,000 troops into harm\xe2\x80\x99s way without really believing in the mission.\xc2\xa0 Why do you think that he came to that conclusion then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you should ask Secretary Gates or others about the meaning of each sentence in his book.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that he also wrote, as I noted earlier, about all the decisions President Obama made on Afghanistan -- \xe2\x80\x9cI believe Obama was right in each of these decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He also says, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the President cared deeply about the troops and their families.\xc2\xa0 I never doubted Obama\xe2\x80\x99s support for the troops.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s a sentiment that we all recognize to be true.</p>\n<p>So the President, as Commander-in-Chief, has to make decisions about when and where we deploy U.S. military forces, and he is extremely conscious of the responsibility that that authority bestows upon him and those who hold his office.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, he would not make decisions about surging U.S. troops without a thorough debate of the policy objectives and the options available to him to achieve those objectives, and a thorough debate about what the proper focus of the mission ought to be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that that process produced a policy that, as Secretary Gates and others have said -- and Secretary Gates was one of the co-authors, if you will, of the policy -- that did just that:\xc2\xa0 refocused our mission; made it clear for our troops and civilians in Afghanistan what the mission was about, why we were in Afghanistan and why it was necessary to be clear that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t staying in Afghanistan in a combat mission forever.\xc2\xa0 That was the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the American people, and he is upholding that commitment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On unemployment, Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid yesterday indicating that he wants the short-term bill as is and then is open to talking about offsets, proposing the Republican plan of taking it to his caucus for a longer-term extension of long-term unemployment benefits.\xc2\xa0 And as I understand it, that\xe2\x80\x99s something that has come to in consultation with the White House.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling that you all are on the same page, so correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong on that.\xc2\xa0 How open are you to discussing offsets, and what type of offsets are you thinking?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said yesterday, Brianna, we believe the House -- the Senate ought to continue its deliberation on this matter and pass the three-month extension without offsets of this emergency assistance.\xc2\xa0 The House ought to follow suit -- it has been done before by previous Congresses and previous administrations, Republican and Democratic -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 And because this is not -- the kinds of debates about how you put a longer-term policy together and what that looks like take time, for one thing, and the families who had their assistance cut off last week don\xe2\x80\x99t have the luxury of time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m asking about the long-term --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, what I said yesterday holds true today, which is that we firmly believe that Congress ought to pass the bill that is currently being considered in the Senate, a three-month extension, and we are happy to discuss with Congress how to move forward beyond the three months.\xc2\xa0 But they have to take care of these families.\xc2\xa0 They used to.\xc2\xa0 They did in the past, Republicans, and they did so 14 out of 17 times without offsets.\xc2\xa0 This kind of assistance is obviously beneficial and a lifeline to many millions of Americans -- 1.3 million in this case with those who were cut off and their families -- but it\xe2\x80\x99s also beneficial directly, economists have told us, to the economy, because this is the kind of funding that goes directly back into the economy and then it spurs economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>So we hope the House will -- the Senate will complete its work and the House will take similar action.\xc2\xa0 And as we said yesterday and Gene said the day before, we\xe2\x80\x99re of course willing to have conversations about what further --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you won\xe2\x80\x99t have those until the short-term is passed and you won\xe2\x80\x99t say what kind of offsets you might be amenable to?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We want to see Congress act on the three-month, short-term extension of emergency benefits.\xc2\xa0 We are absolutely willing to listen and have conversations about how we move forward beyond the three months.\xc2\xa0 But this is, again, not an esoteric debate.\xc2\xa0 There are families who are without this assistance who fear they will not see that assistance renewed, and in many cases rely on that assistance to put food on the table and to pay their gas and electric bills, which are challenging in parts of the country now because of the severe cold.</p>\n<p>Tamara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the senators that was -- Republican senators who was critical to this cloture happening yesterday, Rob Portman, was on the floor recently and said that it was very important to him that there be offsets, and he proposed two that would cover the short-term extension, which he says were things that were proposed in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget:\xc2\xa0 no double dipping on SSI and unemployment benefits, and some reforms to unemployment benefits that apparently the President has proposed before.\xc2\xa0 So are these unreasonable proposals?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, when it comes to the absolute necessity to pass a bill that would extend emergency assistance to these 1.3 million Americans and their families, our position is clear:\xc2\xa0 Congress ought to do it now; the bill that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Senate, they should do it now.\xc2\xa0 And looking in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, which is a document that was balanced and dealt with a number of issues and finding items that you want to apply here or apply there -- there\xe2\x80\x99s time for discussion about how we pay for things.\xc2\xa0 If you remember, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, it was a balance between revenues and savings.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s always taken.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the approach he believes that has helped lead us out of this recovery, helped create the sustained economic growth we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, helped create the sustained job creation we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and helped bring about the dramatic deficit reduction we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>But we need to do more and we need to be focused on economic growth.\xc2\xa0 We need to be focused on middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 We need to be focused on those families and those Americans who are looking for work and need this assistance.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re not any different from the Americans who needed that assistance in the previous administration, when President Bush signed extensions of the assistance without offsets.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re the same kinds of people and they deserve the same kind of treatment from Washington, from Congress, from both parties.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Were there any assurances made to the Republican senators who the President or others in the administration spoke to about any changes to the unemployment program or offsets in later discussions, or any assurances at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m not reading out individual conversations that the President has had with lawmakers.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that in the conversations he and others have had, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear what our view is:\xc2\xa0 We ought to pass this; we ought to take care of these Americans; we ought to, in doing so, appreciate the positive economic effect that extending these benefits would have.\xc2\xa0 And we are open to then having discussions about how to move forward for a full-year extension.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have more to read out.</p>\n<p>Bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Afghan surge, Gates writes, \xe2\x80\x9cThe President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe in his own strategy and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consider the war to be his.\xc2\xa0 For him, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about getting out\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 Given that there\xe2\x80\x99s a copy of the book floating around, has the President been made aware of that?\xc2\xa0 Is there a reaction to it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are numerous press reports about the book.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether the President read them.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the statement that we put out and the statements I\xe2\x80\x99ve made today about the President\xe2\x80\x99s appreciation for Secretary Gates\xe2\x80\x99s service reflect the President\xe2\x80\x99s views.\xc2\xa0 Generally, when I speak for the President, I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it by osmosis.\xc2\xa0 I do it because I know what his views are.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Generally?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good catch.\xc2\xa0 Must be the beard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t analyze every sentence of a book that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve read press reports of it.\xc2\xa0 I know that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President read it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he has not read it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he read it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked him.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you give it to him?\xc2\xa0 Is it on his desk?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have my copy.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But what I can say -- again, I can\xe2\x80\x99t analyze or interpret for you every sentence of this book, even if I had read it all.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the President believes we ought to wind down and end the war in Afghanistan is not a revelation.\xc2\xa0 It was his stated commitment to the American people.\xc2\xa0 So that is why, as part of his policy review, he insisted that we both surge troops and set a date for the beginning of a drawdown and for the completion of that drawdown at the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the policy we are continuing to implement.\xc2\xa0 And it is fully in keeping with the President\'s publicly stated views and commitments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the purpose of tomorrow\'s NSA discussion with leaders in Congress?\xc2\xa0 He\'s not still seeking information from them, is he?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know he wants to hear from them to discuss with them the status of his review, which is ongoing.\xc2\xa0 The Review Group\'s report was publicly released, as you know, so everybody has had a chance to digest that.\xc2\xa0 The President certainly has spent time with it, and as we\'ve said, he believes, with the exception of the one recommendation on which a decision has already been made, a personnel issue, he wants serious consideration of every recommendation from the Review Group.</p>\n<p>But there are other pieces of the overall review that are ongoing.\xc2\xa0 And, as you know, when the President has made decisions about what recommendations he will call for implementing and what he will want to further review, and what he may decide we should not pursue, he\'s going to speak about.\xc2\xa0 And that will happen before the State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on your point about the book a moment ago with Bill that you can\'t focus on every line in here and analyze it, then why in the statement last night did the White House not refute any of the allegations against the President, but went out of your way to defend the Vice President and analyze at least that part of the book?\xc2\xa0 And when you said to Chuck their relationship is great, he relies on him -- we\'ve heard that before.\xc2\xa0 Why if it\'s such a strong relationship do you have to go out of your way to defend him?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It might be because the press constantly asks in response to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we also asked about the allegations against the President and that statement did not address it, is my point.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, this was in response to a single sentence that made a categorical statement of opinion by Secretary Gates about the Vice President and his views that in that case we could say clearly that the President disagrees with that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the lunch with the Vice President, you let the photographers in and that is a great positive step, but you did not let any reporters in.\xc2\xa0 And we see this more and more, that you seem to think giving more access is letting photographers in -- which we support -- but we can\'t have anybody shout a question, we can\'t have -- if the President wants to defend the Vice President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Ed, can I tell you, we let photographers in because he knows he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to.\xc2\xa0 We let photographers in because we\'ve had an ongoing discussion about access for photographers.\xc2\xa0 And I thought that was a good thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we have an ongoing discussion with reporters as well, though.\xc2\xa0 You\'re leaving out that we\'ve had an ongoing discussion.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And you\'re leaving out that word for word, minute for minute, question for question, this President has answered more questions from the free and independent press, or at least as many as his immediate predecessors, which we\'ve discussed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why not today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any President in history who\'s taken questions every day.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not every day.\xc2\xa0 He hasn\'t taken a question since, what, was it December 20th, the last press conference?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well you and he were away for quite some time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s been a long time.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sure he\'ll be taking questions, Ed, again soon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re looking forward to that.\xc2\xa0 Okay, two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve stressed the President\'s commitment to the mission in Afghanistan, given the book.\xc2\xa0 Senators Graham and McCain just came back from Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 They spoke to President Karzai and they claim that President Obama has not spoken to President Karzai since June or July.\xc2\xa0 How is it that the two leaders -- if he\'s committed to the mission, how could the two leaders, as you\'re negotiating a status of forces agreement, how could the two leaders not talk in months?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When did we go to South Africa?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 December 15th [sic].</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was physically in the presence of both Presidents when President Karzai and President Obama exchanged greetings.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Great.\xc2\xa0 But they had a substantive discussion about the status of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President and President Karzai have had discussions in the past.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of mystery about our views on this document that was negotiated in good faith and the need to sign it on the part of the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 So we have robust and constant communication with the Afghan government, both from Washington and from our embassy in Kabul as well as through our military commanders.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was the last time the President spoke to the lead U.S. commander in Afghanistan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\'re in a war footing right now and you don\'t know the last time he spoke to the commanding general?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question, Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>Yes, Jon.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the D.C. public schools were open, as well as many other inner-city schools were open, despite\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tminus-20 degree wind chills.\xc2\xa0 Some of the reasons that the officials are giving is that this is the only place young kids could actually get two warm meals.\xc2\xa0 On the 50th anniversary of LBJ\xe2\x80\x99s War on Poverty, what does this say about America, and how far do we still need to come?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it says that we\'ve made progress -- as those of you who have read the report from the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Economic Advisers know is our view and the President\xe2\x80\x99s view; those of you who saw the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement regarding the 50th anniversary of President Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s War on Poverty know -- but that we have work to do.\xc2\xa0 And the President is committed to engaging in that work, because we need to provide ladders of opportunity to Americans who are in poverty, to those who are in the bottom rungs of the middle class, who are struggling to pay their bills every day, every week.\xc2\xa0 We need to provide the kind of opportunity to our kids so that they can enjoy the economic mobility that made this country great and that made it an accepted fact about the United States of America that no matter what your circumstances, you could be anyone and do anything.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That is the heart of the President\xe2\x80\x99s message that he delivered in Anacostia in December.\xc2\xa0 It is what animates much of his deliberation about and policy decisions about economic matters and strengthening the middle class, creating opportunities for those who strive for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And you will be hearing the President talk about it again and again, as you have throughout his history in public debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could go beyond the written statement that you all put out on the President\xe2\x80\x99s call to Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 Did they discuss any further the questions about eavesdropping on foreign leaders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a further readout on that.\xc2\xa0 I believe the President made the call because of her injury.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if he reached her on a hard line or a mobile phone?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a serious question.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the President calls foreign leaders on a hard line.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Connie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of emphasis on the Israeli-Palestinian issue.\xc2\xa0 Does this administration believe that all the other problems in the Middle East will be settled if that issue is resolved?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the need to make progress on the Middle East peace process is I think clear to the President, clear to his team, and it\xe2\x80\x99s why Secretary Kerry and others at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction continue to work so hard on it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody would agree with an assertion that resolving that conflict resolves all conflicts, but it is certainly a very important issue that merits the focus that Secretary Kerry and the President and other members of his team are giving it.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have any concern that these growing al Qaeda enclaves in Iraq and Syria could pose a direct threat to U.S. security interests here or abroad and could become a similar kind of thing that we saw in Afghanistan before September 11th?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that as the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team and the President make decisions about and assessments about the threats against the United States, they are very focused on those extremist groups and individuals and elements that have as their objective doing harm to the United States and harm to Americans and harm to our allies, and those who are more local in their focus.</p>\n<p>This is without -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not making a judgment about that, but you can be sure that in terms of the al Qaeda presence in Iraq, we are, as you know -- but that\xe2\x80\x99s how we view these things.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely a higher order of concern when we see al Qaeda in a manifestation that represents a threat to the United States, a threat to the American people and a threat to our allies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that one thing that all of us have observed and learned over the years since 9/11 and even prior to it is that there has been -- there are evolutions and developments in the nature of these extremist movements and their focus.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be knowledgeable and understanding of the difference between various groups and their affiliations and their objectives.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a broad statement, not about Anbar province.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted in the past several days the military assistance that we have been working to provide the Iraq government and the consultations that we are undertaking with Iraqi leaders, including the Prime Minister and others, on the essentially two-part strategy that we believe needs to be undertaken and that we are seeing the Iraqi government undertake, which is one that is military in nature and one that is focused on reconciliation and working with Sunni tribes and others in the region to expel al Qaeda from those cities and territories because the overwhelming majority of the Iraqi people do not support and do not want al Qaeda in their midst.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Vice President spoke again, made some calls to Iraq this morning.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. think that Maliki could have done more to forestall the rise of these groups by reaching out more to Sunnis in Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s political process?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is a subject that is an ongoing part of the conversations that we have with leaders in the Iraqi government, including Prime Minister Maliki.\xc2\xa0 In the call that he made to the Prime Minister, the Vice President encouraged him to continue his outreach to local, tribal, and national leaders.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President also welcomed the Council of Ministers\xe2\x80\x99 decision to extend state benefits to tribal forces killed or injured in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\xc2\xa0 He also welcomed the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s statement affirming that Iraqi elections will occur as scheduled, as well as the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to ensuring that humanitarian aid is reaching people in need.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President underscored that America will support and assist Iraq in its fight against international terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, as for Syria, the fighting we see and we hear about between ISIL and the moderate rebels, who remain, many of them, Islamists -- does the administration know not only if the aid to the rebels in Syria goes to these moderate still Islamist rebels?\xc2\xa0 Do you know?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re asking do we know if the assistance is going where we want it to go?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The one -- yes, exactly.\xc2\xa0 And the ones fighting ISIL.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know specifically the answer to that question.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed over the months, that we carefully evaluate in the provision of assistance where it\xe2\x80\x99s going, and obviously want our assistance -- the humanitarian assistance to go to the people who need humanitarian assistance, the Syrian people who are suffering, and the other forms of assistance to go into the hands of those who have the desires and hopes of the Syrian people as their objective in their efforts and their desire for more democracy and freedom.</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that view has changed.\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t say if we know -- if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a particular shipment or -- I mean, these are -- this process is carefully vetted for the reasons that I think underlie your question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How can it be monitored?\xc2\xa0 How is it monitored, these things?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a question best directed to State and Defense in terms of the mechanics of that.\xc2\xa0 But it is a concern.\xc2\xa0 As you know, with regards to some aid, it was suspended in a part of the country because of the situation with a warehouse, and that goes to the heart of your question.\xc2\xa0 But that is a reflection of the seriousness with which we take these matters and the need to get aid into the hands of those in Syria for whom it was meant.</p>\n<p>Last one, Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 What was the result of that investigation in terms of the warehouse and --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to direct you to Defense for that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it possible to get a list of the kinds of weapons or the monetary level of flow that is now going to the opposition?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a question for State or Defense.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Sorry, I missed you, Jared.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Two questions, both timing things.\xc2\xa0 Is the President going to wait to give this surveillance speech until he gets the -- I think it\'s two reports from PCLOB, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, meets with and has had discussions with members of that board and others on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure about the timing of their review, but he\'s certainly in conversations with them about their views.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we\'ve said is that the President will be making his decision and talking about them in remarks prior to the State of the Union address on January 28th.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure about the timing for that report, but what I can tell you is the the President has been and will be fully briefed on their views.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a timing yet for the budget?\xc2\xa0 I know last year was delayed a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that.\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Preview of tomorrow\'s event?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get something for you on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:50 P.M.
