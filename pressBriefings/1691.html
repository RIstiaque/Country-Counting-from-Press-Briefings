Brady Press Briefing Room<br/>  2:12 P.M. EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, sorry I\'m both late and early, all at the same time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even the Clinton White House has never done that -- to be late and early.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me apologize in advance.\xc2\xa0 My five-and-a-half-year-old has a cold; therefore, I have a cold.\xc2\xa0 So if I sniff a little bit, it\'s because of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Just a couple of quick things, and we\'ll get into your questions.\xc2\xa0 In addition to the calls that he made yesterday to foreign leaders, he also called last night Prime Minister Aso of Japan.\xc2\xa0 Also, in addition to later last night, the President signed disaster declarations for both Arkansas and Kentucky and spoke with both of the governors of those two states to notify them of those signatures.</div> <div class="legacy-para">You all, I hope, were at the Lilly Ledbetter signing this morning, so you know a little bit about that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And then -- and we\'ll try to conclude this at an appropriate time -- at 3:00 p.m., the President will take a group of you into a meeting with the President and Treasury Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 I know the President is anxious to make a few remarks there about some -- about stuff that\'s been in the news the last couple of days, and particularly stuff that was on the front page of our newspapers this morning relating to CEO bonuses, which he will get into at that -- at those remarks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">And with that, let me take a few questions.\xc2\xa0 Jennifer.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 News-of-the-day question -- the military judge\'s ruling in the USS Cole suspect case at Guantanamo.\xc2\xa0 We\'d like a comment on that, first of all, but also kind of the bigger picture.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you guys have asked for a delay in all the trials there.\xc2\xa0 Does this throw a kink into that?\xc2\xa0 How does it affect the broader effort to step back and take a look at those detainees?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Repeat the question, because we can\'t hear with the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I\'m sorry, with the new Zamboni?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Repeat the question.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the question related to -- come on in, guys.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 No more -- the place is now sold out, so no more tickets.</div> <div class="legacy-para">This was -- Jennifer asked a question about the ruling that just came down, which did not grant a stay for the military commission in one case.\xc2\xa0 We just learned of the ruling here, as you did, and we are consulting with the Pentagon and the Department of Justice to explore our options in that case.\xc2\xa0 I believe that all the other trials were stayed, which I think continues to give us what we need to evaluate who is at Gitmo and make the decisions commensurate with the executive order that the President signed.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But we are -- we\'re working to get some consultation on that, and when we have some we\'ll certainly let you know about that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, what you\'re saying is that this -- the action in this one case you don\'t believe throws a kink into the ability to evaluate the entire situation --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, not at all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and the status of detainees there?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the President was going to be talking about executive bonuses.\xc2\xa0 There is a report that came out of the New York Comptroller\'s Office a short time ago saying that the corporate CEOs, many of them of companies that have received taxpayer dollars, were paid massive bonuses, totaling more than $18 billion.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be addressing that in some way?\xc2\xa0 Can you elaborate?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He will address that, and I will elaborate and I will give you the one-word answer that he gave us this morning:\xc2\xa0 outrageous.\xc2\xa0 I think he will expound on the outrageousness of what he read.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President spoke during his inaugural of an ethic of responsibility that we needed to see reinstituted in certain aspects of our country, particularly in our financial institutions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Whether it\'s government or the financial system, we\'re not going to be able to do what is needed to be done to stabilize our financial system if the American people read about this type of outrageous behavior.\xc2\xa0 We started the beginning of the week with a bank that\'s in some trouble interested in purchasing a $50 million jet.\xc2\xa0 I think the outrage on the Hill and some phone calls and some outrage here probably stopped that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But obviously, we\'re asking a lot of the American people to take extraordinary steps to stabilize our financial system.\xc2\xa0 The President is committed to doing what is necessary to do that, but shares the frustration of the American people when they read about I think it was the sixth largest year of bonuses.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think anybody that\'s opened their 401(k) statement has found out that this was the sixth best year for Wall Street.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll address that in some more rage --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be specific measures that will be brought forth by the administration --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, one of the things that the President is doing today is he met -- had his economic daily briefing that included Dr. Summers, Christina Romer, Secretary Geithner.\xc2\xa0 They are working on -- that is a portion of what they\'re working on as it relates to going forward on the financial stability money that Congress has appropriated.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What can he do?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we\'re looking into, and that\'s what we\'re working on recommendations for.\xc2\xa0 You know, I think the Comptroller of New York had some -- asked the President to look into this, and I think he shares the Comptroller\'s outrage in this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 One, he met with CEOs yesterday, and I realize that\'s before the Comptroller\'s report, but did he say anything about this?\xc2\xa0 Because the two gentlemen who introduced him yesterday, their combined five-year compensation package was $150 million.\xc2\xa0 Did he turn to them and say, you guys are cutting jobs and yet you\'re making $150 million?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President talked about responsibility with them yesterday.\xc2\xa0 The President doesn\'t meet with CEOs where he doesn\'t talk about responsibility.\xc2\xa0 They specifically talked about the jet purchase.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think the President has been very clear on the notion that what has to be done will not be able to be done unless the American people have confidence not just in the decisions that government is now forced to make to address these crises, but more importantly, that they don\'t see some of these actors behaving differently.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I can just follow up.\xc2\xa0 In the TARP legislation last fall, when the President was a mere senator, it was clear for any of us who were following the legislation that executive compensation, the steps that they were taking to have taxpayer dollars not go to that, were minuscule at best, and the people who were preventing anything from really happening were Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, because they didn\'t think that there was really anything you could do, that there would be a way that Wall Street would find their way around whatever law.\xc2\xa0 I mean, President Obama supported the legislation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 President Obama, or mere Senator Obama, and many others did in order to get the money we needed to get our financial system going again.\xc2\xa0 I think it is fair that this President believes that the results of that first set of money have failed to live up to the expectation that all of the American people had for it.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why this administration and this economic team are taking the time to evaluate how we move forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, the principles that we outlined for the Senate, before they approved a second batch of money to be used by this administration, included reining in executive compensation and ensuring that excessive bonuses aren\'t part of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, part of the meeting that you\'ll see the beginning of today is a continued discussion on moving forward and making some of those decisions as it relates to that next set of money.\xc2\xa0 But, Dick, understand the President -- the President shares the American people\'s outrage on this.\xc2\xa0 You know, it\'s -- there are a lot of words that you can conjure up to describe that story.\xc2\xa0 I think "outrageous" was just the one that I can bring to you here today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on Tuesday you talked about how you felt that some Republicans would come onboard with the stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 Now we know that did not happen.\xc2\xa0 This morning you said that the President was a little disappointed.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if the President is -- in hindsight, is looking at this and saying perhaps there should have been more concessions, perhaps he shouldn\'t have made the joke about smacking me over the head.\xc2\xa0 Is he looking back and saying --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think they\'re not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I think -- (laughter) -- I think he seems fine with that recommendation.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is he thinking, if I had to do this all over again, I would have done it differently?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, I think if he had it to do all over again -- and the truth is he has it to do all over now in the Senate and will have it to do -- I promise I won\'t make any -- I was looking up lacrosse metaphors, but I figured I just was way out of my league.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President wouldn\'t do anything differently.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the President didn\'t do anything differently last night after the vote where, as you mentioned, none of the -- none of those Republicans supported the bill, but still came over to the White House to continue a cooperative relationship to get something done for the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Look, old habits die hard in this town.\xc2\xa0 We get that.\xc2\xa0 But the President understands that changing the way Washington works isn\'t likely to happen in just 10 days.\xc2\xa0 But he believes that the time that he spent with Republicans when they asked to come down here and they did, or the time that he spent going to Capitol Hill, or the time that he spent last night is a worthy investment of his time.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">We have a responsibility -- the President and Congress, Democrats and Republicans -- to do something for the American people.\xc2\xa0 You know, probably each day that I\'ve been here this week, we\'ve had some statistic, at least in this town, to remind us of where we are.\xc2\xa0 The President I think looks forward to the day in which this government, and myself at this podium, aren\'t reminded each and every day about those statistics.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We saw earlier in the week businesses that are shedding I think 100,000 jobs in two or three days\' time.\xc2\xa0 Tomorrow isn\'t going to be that day where we don\'t talk about these statistics, because we\'re likely to get a number for economic growth for the fourth quarter that\'s fairly staggering.\xc2\xa0 And today we find out that more Americans are receiving unemployment benefits since records began being kept on that statistic in 1967.</div> <div class="legacy-para">He believes that the time he put in and the time he will continue to put in to listen, to consult and to work with both Democrats and Republicans is important because we owe it to the American people to get them a piece of legislation that puts money back in their pockets, creates jobs and gets this economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And to follow, was the President caught off guard by the fact that 11 Republicans voted -- I\'m sorry, Democrats, sorry -- voted against this?\xc2\xa0 And is he going to reach out specifically to the Democrats?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we\'re -- nobody\'s looking at any label to see who to or not to reach out to.\xc2\xa0 His hand is -- is, was and will always reach out.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s safe to say we didn\'t presume we\'d get a hundred percent of anything.\xc2\xa0 We probably won\'t get a hundred percent of a proposal; we won\'t get a hundred percent support from either Republicans or Democrats.\xc2\xa0 Again, that doesn\'t stop the President\'s effort to push forward -- and I think we -- you know, we shouldn\'t lose sight of the fact that last night was a big step forward for the American people in getting that package one step closer to the President\'s desk and one step closer to making the lives of the American people a little bit better in what we all see as a very tough economic time.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The tone here sounds like he\'s just going to continue doing what he did to try to get Republicans to vote for this in the House.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\'t he need to dramatically ratchet this up -- getting Democrats to compromise, working the Republicans, making changes in the bill?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Chip, our test on this bill -- and our test on seeking these ideas -- is not whether they come from one party or whether they need to be compromised with another party.\xc2\xa0 Instead it\'s how best do we put forward a package that meets the principle of putting money into people\'s pockets, spending money to help lay some long-term investments for economic growth and put people back to work right now.</div> <div class="legacy-para">He doesn\'t believe -- and he\'s said this a number of times -- that any one party has dominion over good ideas.\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to continue to listen, strengthen the package.\xc2\xa0 I presume that the package that comes out of the Senate will be different than the one that came out of the House.\xc2\xa0 And as I\'ve said, this will be a long and winding road to getting something on his desk.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any specifics on what he\'s doing, who he\'s calling, changes he\'s considering?\xc2\xa0 Any specifics on what he\'s going to do differently this time?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t -- I think I said earlier, I don\'t think he\'s going to do a ton differently.\xc2\xa0 The key is he\'s going to continue to listen and to reach out.\xc2\xa0 I think -- again, I think as we go forward on down this line, we\'ll see him continue to reach out.\xc2\xa0 And my presumption is that we\'ll pick up support on both sides of the aisle on this.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much, any guess, ballpark?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You can\'t use baseball analogies.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go to the strengthen -- you specifically used that word just now, actually, and in your statement yesterday, which implies that there are parts of this bill you guys don\'t like or would like to see improved.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, the President --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get into -- what is it that needs strengthening in this bill, period?\xc2\xa0 Or question mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have specifics -- what\'s that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I said period.\xc2\xa0 I should have said question mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I don\'t have specifics to enumerate.\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- the President said to House Republicans and Senate Republicans that obviously the bill -- the bill that will work its way through both sides of the aisle is probably not exactly what any one person would write, regardless of their party.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\'s got to be.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there must be --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, there already had been.\xc2\xa0 There had been.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To put the word "strengthen" in there implies -- I mean, is it infrastructure?\xc2\xa0 Do you want more money for infrastructure?\xc2\xa0 The spending ratio is not correct here?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\'re working on -- as I\'ve said, we\'re working on ensuring that those spending ratios get money into the economy quickly.\xc2\xa0 He talked with Republicans in the Senate about infrastructure spending.\xc2\xa0 He\'s talked to House and Senate members about tax provisions.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- you know, we\'ll -- we\'re going to continue to work with and listen to folks on any number of these items.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are the two -- infrastructure, tax -- the two biggest areas, is that fair to say?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would say two of many areas.\xc2\xa0 Again, Chuck, his test is this:\xc2\xa0 If you\'ve got an idea that helps strengthen the bill, bring it to our attention and we\'ll work through that process.\xc2\xa0 Again -- again, I don\'t think this process -- it\'s not going to -- it didn\'t end last night.\xc2\xa0 Again, we took a very important step forward in getting legislation to the President\'s desk and hopefully legislation that will improve --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'d just go back to the word "strengthen."\xc2\xa0 That implies there was something you didn\'t quite like in the House bill.\xc2\xa0 Is there something that he singled out that --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he singled out, over the course of the week, a couple of things that he didn\'t -- that he agreed with but he didn\'t -- or something he didn\'t think should be in the bill.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ll continue that process.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Mark.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there serious talk about this at the cocktail party last evening?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not attend the cocktail party last evening.\xc2\xa0 I went home to read a book to my son.\xc2\xa0 I do believe -- well, did the subject come up?\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 "My Pet Goat"?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I did not read "My Pet Goat."\xc2\xa0 No, I read -- (laughter) -- I read something on mummies to Ethan.\xc2\xa0 But I -- yes, the subject certainly came up.\xc2\xa0 You know, the President also wanted last night to be a little bit more social, you know, so that individuals could better get to know each other and understand where they\'re coming from in these legislative disagreements.\xc2\xa0 But, again, you know, the President\'s outreach on this will continue.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll have some folks over probably this weekend to watch the Super Bowl.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Members of Congress?\xc2\xa0 Leaders?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I will get a list of that for you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Journalists, members of the press?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But, you know, again, the President believes, and has believed this, that this type of outreach is important not just on this bill or on this issue but as a way of setting about a tone in Washington that can get things done for the American people.\xc2\xa0 Many of you heard the President often quote the ability to disagree without being disagreeable, and I think that\'s the tone that he\'d like to see dominate these debates and dominate the issues that we discuss each day in Washington.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another matter, did the President ask the State Department or NSC staff to draft a conciliatory letter to Iran?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President -- neither the President nor the Secretary of State has requested or seen any such letter that I think was reported in an overseas newspaper.\xc2\xa0 So I think that sort of closes the book a little bit on that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, Mr. Elmendorf yesterday at CBO said that there are going to be billions and billions more needed for financial stability.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House concur in that?\xc2\xa0 And if so, how soon might we see a request?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, the financial team continues, the economic team continues to meet on this subject -- Chuck asked this yesterday -- to meet on -- and the President talked about this with leaders of Congress, he\'s talked about this with us -- and understanding that a recovery and reinvestment plan is just one part of what has to happen in going forward to get the economy moving again -- financial stability being a big chunk of that, in addition to financial reregulation, which he talked about yesterday with Paul Volcker.\xc2\xa0 Part of the meeting that the President will have today with Secretary Geithner will focus in on some of these -- some of these decisions.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\'t know about specific spending numbers.\xc2\xa0 I know the President has talked about, and I think the American people understand, that this President will do what is necessary to ensure, one, that we don\'t suffer any sort of financial collapse and that we have the resources that we need to ensure that banks are lending money to families, to small businesses, and to large businesses.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\'t want to get ahead of those decisions coming to the President and him making them.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, again, it\'s a big part of many different avenues that we have to work through to get the economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Major.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, on the stimulus, on the politics side, is the White House compiling, and will it release, as this debate moves forward, a state-by-state analysis of job losses?\xc2\xa0 And does it support the efforts of America Coming Together, MoveOn and other groups that were supportive of Senator Obama during the campaign putting together television ads and other things to put pressure on Republicans to get behind this stimulus effort?\xc2\xa0 Those are two political questions.\xc2\xa0 I have a policy one after that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me -- well, let me -- if you can allow -- if you\'ll allow me to rephrase a little bit.\xc2\xa0 I think you\'re asking me about a story -- an earlier version of a story that I want to tell you doesn\'t reflect the President\'s thinking.\xc2\xa0 And I want to -- but I also want to split that off of different analysis of jobs numbers or transportation spending numbers or school rehabilitation numbers or any sort of analysis that the economic team may do.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I just -- what I want to do is separate, I think, the political part of that story and the analysis that may be done not for political argument, but to show and demonstrate for the American people where the investments -- where the money is going and what investments they\'re going toward in this economic recovery plan.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve certainly talked about individual projects.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll talk about the way money is certainly spent and the effect that it will -- we believe it will have on the economy.\xc2\xa0 I think those analysis are being done on both sides of this.\xc2\xa0 But the --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The answer is yes, it\'s just not political?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, it\'s just not political.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Understood.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Your policy question?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The CBO was asked by Kent Conrad to evaluate any ways to more rapidly spend out the money that is in the stimulus bill.\xc2\xa0 And the CBO reported back to Kent Conrad that there are several ways to do it -- two specific ones I want to ask you about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Waiving requirements for environmental and judicial reviews, and allowing contracts and grants to be awarded outside the normal competitive bid process.\xc2\xa0 Now, since those kinds of things or regulatory or speed bump things Democrats often supported, I\'m wondering is the administration open to reviewing those kinds of things if in fact they impede spending of money that you believe would be essential to helping the economy recovery.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me give for you in this answer what the President told the governors when he met with them -- I guess this would have been sometime in mid- to late November in Philadelphia, because this was an issue that was raised I think maybe by Governor Schwarzenegger or by one of the other governors, regulatory red tape, so to speak.\xc2\xa0 And the President simply said, you know, if there are things that we can do to speed money into the economy as it relates to infrastructure spending or things like that, he\'s more than happy to take a look at them in order to get this money infused into the economy and putting people back to work as quickly as possible.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to ask Democrats to put that specific language in the bill?\xc2\xa0 Because oftentimes that\'s what\'s required to get over these hurdles.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that we would want to look at exactly -- I\'ve not looked at the CBO report that you mentioned specifically.\xc2\xa0 But all I can say, without reading what specifically they told Senator Conrad, but that the President shares the opinion of both Democrats and Republicans that we should seek to do this as quickly as is reasonably doable.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I was asked about this yesterday, about the notion of, well, if you only have 75 percent spent out in 18 months, what about this other 25 percent?\xc2\xa0 And I think it bears repeating that, regrettably, we are not likely to wake up on the 1st of January in 2011 and find everything going so great.\xc2\xa0 So there is money that we\'ll spend out after this 18-month period that will create jobs in that first and second quarter of 2011.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t see that as a bad thing, because we\'re going to need jobs created and money spent in that -- in those quarters in 2011, and certainly probably beyond that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back on the politics thing, does the President endorse or support these outside groups pressuring Republicans with TV ads and other things?\xc2\xa0 Does he have any message for them --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President is not going to referee what individual interest groups on either side of this do, except --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he believe it enhances the political environment toward compromise?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think the President -- I think the President\'s own actions in reaching out to Republicans demonstrate his willingness to do what is necessary to bring anybody involved in this process along so that he or she can support a recovery plan that the American people can be proud of.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Martin Feldstein, who is a noted conservative economist who has been hailed by Democrats as sort of supporting the idea of a stimulus package, in today\'s Post wrote that -- called the stimulus "an $800 billion mistake," and detailed reasons why he thinks that the particular pieces in it are not actually stimulative and won\'t have the result -- I guess the question is, is the President open to conversations over the next couple of weeks with conservative economists who argue not that there shouldn\'t be a stimulus and not that it shouldn\'t even be as large -- some of them even want larger -- but that the pieces of this are the wrong piece, and is he open to potentially hearing their argument and potentially changing the plan?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me address a couple --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, if you could tell us who he\'s supporting in the Super Bowl.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 All right, let me hold on that one for a second.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Let me take your tougher question first.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think -- part of my answer bears on exactly part of your question, which is, you mentioned that even among economists, conservative ones, there\'s a -- there are varying opinions about the size of a stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 There are inherently different opinions about what should be encompassed in those varying sizes of stimulus packages.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I know that, if you go back and read the op-ed, I know that, for instance, one of the things that Mr. Feldstein mentions is he disagrees with the notion that the President\'s $500 tax cut will be paid out in a lump sum, and that\'s just not true.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">One of the reasons that we fashioned the tax cut in the way we did was precisely to take into account the notion -- and we\'ve seen this in the past couple of stimulus attempts by Congress and the President -- that lump-sum payments that people tend to get, one-time checks tend to go into savings at a rate far greater than spending because people get this one-time check but understand that it\'s not going to continue, which causes them to save the money, which is why the tax cuts in the President\'s plan pay out a little bit at a time so that people that may get $20 or $25 more in each pay period will get used to spending that $20 to $25 each pay period.\xc2\xa0 They\'ll understand that if I get it today, because I got paid, that I\'ll get it in two weeks because I get paid, and I can change my spending habits by that amount of money through the course of the tax cut.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I do think there are some just general disagreements -- as you mentioned, disagreements even among conservative economists.\xc2\xa0 There\'s disagreements about what we believe creates jobs and what Mr. Feldstein might believe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the broader question is, you talk about him wanting to reach out to Republicans and change the tone.\xc2\xa0 Has he -- does he have any interest in bringing some of these folks into the White House and sitting down --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know the precise answer to whether he\'s interested in bringing some of those people down per se to talk.\xc2\xa0 Obviously he\'s -- he reads the fine Washington Post and listens to their arguments.\xc2\xa0 Again, you know, I think if you look at other -- others -- some that helped Senator McCain that have weighed in on what they think is a quality stimulus package.\xc2\xa0 But again, he is always open to listening to ideas from across the political spectrum and different political parties.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Super Bowl question?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Oh, the Super Bowl question.\xc2\xa0 I have not asked him specifically who he is rooting for, but I will -- which I will do.\xc2\xa0 I know he has a tremendous respect and affection for the Rooney family, who we saw at many different points along the campaign trail.\xc2\xa0 The best breakfast place we went to in the entire campaign was a place that we went with Mr. Rooney in Pittsburgh --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Steelers --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 And so I -- without prejudging who he roots for, I know he has tremendous affection for the Rooney family.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'ve talked for a couple of weeks now about the multi-leg -- is it three-legged or four-legged stool?\xc2\xa0 And I\'m wondering when you\'re going to show us a little more leg.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Only I can do that in here, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 You can\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are those legs?\xc2\xa0 What are those legs, specifically?\xc2\xa0 And when are we going to hear anything about the housing plan, about the financial rescue plan and about this reregulation?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said earlier, meetings on each of those continue.\xc2\xa0 Again, the President met with Mr. Volcker yesterday to talk about regulation.\xc2\xa0 He met with his economic team this morning as part of his daily briefing on financial stability and the recovery plan.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I\'ve done this a couple different ways in here.\xc2\xa0 But I think roughly you have -- whether you\'re talking about stools or pillars or what have you -- three main areas:\xc2\xa0 you have a recovery and reinvestment plan, which is moving through Congress; you have a financial stability package; and you have financial reregulation.\xc2\xa0 I think involved in some of that in different areas is a housing plan and things like that.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">I don\'t know that it\'s tremendously pertinent to get caught up in whether there are three stools -- three legs on this stool or four, or rungs, or what have you.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people understand that we have to deal with -- and the President also understands that we have to deal with each of these in order to move the economy forward.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure which part of the -- which leg housing is.\xc2\xa0 But I think people that understand -- whether you\'re living in a neighborhood where the house next to you got foreclosed, or you\'re not now living in the neighborhood because the house you are in got foreclosed -- you may not understand which leg of the stool you\'re on, but you understand it\'s a problem that has to be dealt with.</div> <div class="legacy-para">We\'ll have I think soon more information and more on many of the things that you mentioned, be it housing, be it regulation, be it financial stability, that members of the Cabinet and the President will talk about.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The international aspect of that, the international leg of the stool that was discussed by the G20, and it is supposed to be discussed in London, people say that it\'s not moving anywhere, specifically the Russians are -- and not only the Russians -- they are complaining that the Financial Stability Forum, which is like the setup that\'s in the focus right now, they agree that all the major countries should be in, but the BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China -- they\'re not there.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the -- and the President talked about this when he was a mere senator and a candidate -- that if one entity takes steps and it\'s not followed by other countries taking steps, be it regulation, stability or stimulus, that you\'re likely to see capital flows change all around the world, you could -- we certainly saw it back in September.</div> <div class="legacy-para">The President talked about -- again, the candidate Obama talked about that in September, working together in unison, all of these countries.\xc2\xa0 And I think you\'ll hear more about some of those specific plans as we lead to and get closer to going in April to the second round of this in Europe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iran, the President of Iran, President Ahmadinejad\'s speech yesterday calling for profound changes in U.S. policy, an end to support of murdering Zionists, and an apology for U.S. crimes.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s best to instead focus not on what the leader of -- one of the leaders of Iran might have said, but instead what the President believes:\xc2\xa0 that we must use all elements of our national power to protect our interest as it relates to Iran.\xc2\xa0 That includes -- as the President talked about in the campaign -- diplomacy where possible, and that we have many issues to work through.\xc2\xa0 An illicit nuclear program by the Iranians, the sponsorship of terrorism, and the threatening of peace in Israel are just a few of the issues that this President believes the Iranian leadership should address.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The dialogue you speak of, can the President have a dialogue with someone who speaks in those terms?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President said back in the campaign, it\'s unclear who -- exactly who that dialogue would be with in Iran.\xc2\xa0 Again, if -- in order for this to happen, there has to be some preparation and an understanding and a responsibility by both sides in understanding what\'s going to be talked about, and the responsibilities that each side has.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now that the Congress has acted, or I guess not acted, where is the President on the digital TV conversion?\xc2\xa0 Does he believe that doing it as scheduled on February 17th is going to cause undo hardship and confusion?\xc2\xa0 And if so, is there anything unilaterally he can do to postpone it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A good question that -- let me take.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- obviously during the transition the President\'s team asked that Congress consider this.\xc2\xa0 The Senate did and the House did not.\xc2\xa0 So let me take that question and --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow that up?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you so much.\xc2\xa0 A number of Democrats in Congress want to restore the so-called Fairness Doctrine, which before it was repealed applied to only electronics media and not to any print or media --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I thought we were -- I thought we were talking about DTV.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President believe that -- (laughter) -- this is on the same planet --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'m pretty sure I did not -- I don\'t think I got an answer to my question.\xc2\xa0 I think we were talking about DTV, and now we seem to be somewhat -- I\'m going to go back to baseball -- far field on the Fairness Doctrine.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since you mentioned it, from the field, does the President believe -- (laughter) -- does the President believe --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lester, far field?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the selectivity of some media and not others is fair?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I have no information on the Fairness Doctrine, and I will endeavor to get some clarity on DTV.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Sheryl.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, something you said earlier struck me.\xc2\xa0 You said that it\'s going to take longer than 10 days to sort of change the ways of Washington.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that the vote in the House was the result of sort of the deep ingrained patterns of the parties voting along party lines, or does he think that it was the result of philosophical differences over whether this bill would in fact work?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that\'s in many ways a question to ask those that exercised that vote yesterday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, no, you\'re assessing the bill and the vote and the way --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 It\'s hard for me to speak to the mindset of -- either collectively or individually -- members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The President and his team formulated a proposal that they thought, and a framework and principles, that they thought would put money back in people\'s pockets and spend money to create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what we endeavor to do, and what the process endeavors to do as it moves forward.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, though?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, you\'re the one that said, "changing the ways of Washington."\xc2\xa0 What did you mean by that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there\'s any number of ways.\xc2\xa0 I mean, obviously we\'ve had a several-day discussion about bipartisanship.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had -- we\'ve talked about different vote counts.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve talked about nominations and confirmations.\xc2\xa0 And we\'ve seen somebody -- certainly some people in this room seem surprised at the lengths the President will go to to reach out to the other party, regardless of the results that happen on any given day.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">But that\'s not going to change the President\'s desire to do that reaching out, and to try, as I said earlier, figure out a way that even while we disagree we don\'t have to do it in a way that\'s disagreeable.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess the question is, doesn\'t your statement imply that it was politics as usual?\xc2\xa0 If you say, there were no Republicans, it\'s going to take awhile to change the ways of Washington, doesn\'t that imply that it was a political move by the Republicans?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\'d leave it some to them to figure out motivations.\xc2\xa0 I think we all believe -- Democrat or Republican, Congress or the executive branch -- that we\'re going to be held accountable to the American people to get something done.\xc2\xa0 Again, whether it\'s unemployment claims, whether it\'s GDP numbers, whether it\'s layoffs, we\'re in a crisis that requires us acting quickly to get something done.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, real quick on Iran, a follow-up.\xc2\xa0 Is it the President\'s view that the military option with Iran is still on the table?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 The President hasn\'t changed his viewpoint that he should preserve all his options.</div> <div class="legacy-para">David.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the question of bipartisanship, you keep talking about the President wanting to reach out and continue to take in ideas.\xc2\xa0 The House Republican Whip just sent out an email this afternoon, even while you were talking, accusing the White House of issuing political threats rather than engaging in bipartisan activity, and actually naming you as one of the people making threats.\xc2\xa0 Can you engage in bipartisan activity if you\'re being accused of making political threats against the Republicans?\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I\'ve been -- I don\'t \xe2\x80\x93</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\'s what Cantor is saying.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\'s hard for me to step into the mindset of any individual and talk about the motivations for why they think I\'m threatening people.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re really innocent?\xc2\xa0 You\'re really innocent?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is there a fallacy --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I guess --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re talking --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I think many people in this room have written that -- when I seem to be overbearing, in their words, that I don\'t think I leave a lot of misimpression as to what that overbearing might be.\xc2\xa0 So I think I\'ve been fairly mild-mannered today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think I\'ve -- at least to my knowledge, not threatened anybody.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But, you know, again, I -- I think this is a little bit about what I talked about, about changing the way Washington works, you know?\xc2\xa0 You know, I mean --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you change -- but what I\'m asking --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But let me finish --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- can you change it from just one end of Pennsylvania Avenue?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No, but I don\'t think we\'re going to.\xc2\xa0 I think the American people will demand that we change it at both ends.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t think that we\'re going to be able to address America\'s problems unless or until we do so.\xc2\xa0 But, you know, I think it\'s important not to get caught up in a typical email back and forth between this podium and the Congress and that sort of thing, you know.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the President understands that old habits die hard, and that\'s not going to stop him from working each and every day to make sure that something gets done worthwhile for the American people.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Jonathan.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, is there anything -- is there anything -- two questions.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in the stimulus bill that the President considers as sacrosanct?\xc2\xa0 And then -- that he wouldn\'t\xc2\xa0 negotiate over.\xc2\xa0 And then secondly, the President\'s home team, the White Sox, as you know, had invited him to toss out the opening pitch -- a long tradition for Presidents.\xc2\xa0 Is he going to do that at Comiskey, or will he choose perhaps the Nationals here in Washington or the new Yankee stadium up in the Bronx?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Wow.\xc2\xa0 A plethora of choices.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 See, Washington -- we have choices for questions.\xc2\xa0 I saw the invitation from the White Sox.\xc2\xa0 I will check on that.\xc2\xa0 He did that before and it was a lot of fun.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- double-header.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 There you go.\xc2\xa0 We could go to the Nationals game and maybe the White Sox, too.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He wants to, I assume, right?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 And -- oh, he loves that.\xc2\xa0 So -- I\'m sorry, your first --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there anything in the stimulus package that he considers as sacrosanct, that he wouldn\'t be able to negotiate over?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\'ve heard the President talk about believing that the "Make Work Pay" tax cut that he ran on in the campaign and -- that is part of this bill -- is something that he believes quite strongly in.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- as he listens to other ideas, I think he\'s -- I think he\'s decided both as a campaign platform and, more importantly, what makes good economic sense is to put money back into the pockets of people who have watched their wages decline as they\'ve worked harder, as their bills have gotten more expensive, as their expenses have mounted.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s something that in the meeting both here at the White House and up on Capitol Hill -- I think it\'s been reported that he said that he felt comfortable with those provisions.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I follow up on the rationale on that?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I just follow up on the rationale on that?\xc2\xa0 Because one of the major problems out there is consumer debt and you\'re saying that, first of all, you\'d like to discourage savings like --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Hold on, hold on, hold on.\xc2\xa0 Let me just stop you about halfway.\xc2\xa0 The question that was asked was about Mr. Feldstein\'s op-ed as it related to a lump-sum payment.\xc2\xa0 And all I -- I did not discourage -- I hope everyone saves money -- I didn\'t discourage savings.\xc2\xa0 I simply said that if you look at the economic principles of a lump-sum payment in the form of a $300 check, as been given before, or a $500 check for a worker in this plan, or a $1000 check for a family that has two workers, that economic studies show that lump-sum payments tend not to be spent out as quickly or as fully because people and consumers recognize that it\'s a one-time payment that they\'re not going to see during their next paycheck.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">The point of an economic stimulus plan is to get money into people\'s hands and into people\'s pockets so that they use their hand to reach in their pocket and spend that money.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what a payment like the one we have structured will do because, again, it provides that money out over a period of time where they get used to spending that money every two weeks.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I\'m not discouraging savings.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'m pretty sure that my answer was quite clear on the fact that that was not the case.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess the question, though, is consumer behavior.\xc2\xa0 And with the rebate, it was hoped that people would spend it, when in fact many of them ended up using it to pay off credit card debt, paying for, you know, higher price of gas.\xc2\xa0 And I guess if you\'re just giving out a small portion per pay period, aren\'t people just as likely to use that as paying off their credit cards than to spend money that they don\'t have?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me try this -- let me -- I\'m going to swing a third time and see if I can hit this baseball.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try to do it -- I know, I had to get to it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Again, I think economic studies show -- and I will endeavor to get you one of these economic studies -- is that if you want to get people -- through a tax cut -- money that they\'re more likely to save -- or I\'m sorry -- more likely to spend faster is to do so by spreading it out so that their consumer behavior is augmented by the fact that they understand that that money is coming every pay period; versus giving it to them in one lump sum where, attitudinally, they understand that it\'s not likely to change.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think that\'s the reason why the structure of our tax cut in terms of "Make Work Pay" is done that way.\xc2\xa0 It\'s tilted toward lower- and middle-income individuals and families who are likely to take that money and spend it and get this economy moving again.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Yes, sir.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President seems to have deferred a little bit to the House Democrats during this process and now, presumably, he\'ll let the Senate process run its course.\xc2\xa0 When you get to negotiations between the two houses -- I realize I\'m getting a little ahead of the game, but we\'re kind of curious -- will the President get involved personally at that level or will he leave it to his economic team?\xc2\xa0 Does he intend to sit down with the leaders of the two parties to try to work out a deal?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t -- I don\'t know the exact answer.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t -- I think that\'s a strong possibility.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think he\'s largely, in some ways, out of the legislative process by dint of trading one job for the next.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t think I would close the door in any way on the notion that he\'ll get involved.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Corollary to that, Robert, when the President went to the Hill on Tuesday, Republicans told him they had been shut out of the negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Might he have leaned on Speaker Pelosi a little more to facilitate negotiations?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, Kirk, you know, when the -- I guess I don\'t altogether agree with that notion, largely because you can see provisions in this bill that are directly reflective of the input that they\'ve given.\xc2\xa0 Net operating loss is a provision in there that I think some wanted to take out, but then the President and his team asked that it be kept in.\xc2\xa0 The -- there\'s certainly energy provisions in there that are reflective of work that Democrats and Republicans have done together on important issues that will increase the number of clean energy jobs in this country.\xc2\xa0</div> <div class="legacy-para">And I think I used this example yesterday with my -- of my friend, who apparently is emailing around, that the Whip said to the President of the United -- to the President-elect then, you know, it would be -- give the American people great confidence if we put these projects up on the Internet and for everyone to see how the money was spent and how the jobs would be created.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s exactly the intention that the President and his team have.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So I think the input of -- the input has been there.\xc2\xa0 I think the legislation is reflective of that.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President will continue, again, to listen to those ideas so that anybody that has a good idea will be heard.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\'ve got no regrets about how you all handled it?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think we -- you know, sometimes it might not all look like it pays off at the beginning, but I think the President believes that the time that he\'s spent here and on Capitol Hill and talking to members was time well spent and time that he\'ll continue to do.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.
