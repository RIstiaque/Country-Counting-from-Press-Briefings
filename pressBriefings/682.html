Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:15 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so we\'ll go straight to your questions.</p>\n<p>Julie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to see if you had anything to tell us today on the location of Edward Snowden.\xc2\xa0 More generally, if he\xe2\x80\x99s in Hong Kong or some other country that has an extradition treaty with the United States, is it the White House\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that that country would send him back to the U.S.?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As was the case yesterday, I am not going to discuss the subject of a recently opened investigation.\xc2\xa0 So the whereabouts of this individual, his status, any details about the investigation I would refer to -- questions about those matters I would refer to the Department of Justice and the FBI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the broader question, though, if he is in a country, or if someone were to be in a country that had an extradition treaty with the United States, would it be the White House\xe2\x80\x99s expectation that that country would --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that goes to the case itself, and we\'re going to wait for the investigation to proceed before we weigh in with that kind of assessment.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll try this one then.\xc2\xa0 Was the President aware that this was an individual that the U.S. was looking at, or his whereabouts, when he met with President Xi during the China summit over the weekend?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the answer to that is no.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up as part of those discussions?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 And then on a separate topic, can you explain a little bit of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on the decision to stop pushing for changes on the morning-after pill availability?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Julie, if I could just say on the last one, I think I mentioned yesterday, the President was made aware of the revelations about the individual taking responsibility for these leaks by senior staff aboard Air Force One after departing California.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On the other question, on Plan B, could you ask me again and I\xe2\x80\x99ll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to know what the thinking behind the decision last night was.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, twofold.\xc2\xa0 You know what the President\xe2\x80\x99s personal views are.\xc2\xa0 He expressed them here in this room.\xc2\xa0 And he supported the decision by Secretary Sebelius with regards to the use of this medication by young girls, ages 10 and 11, and the lack of sufficient data, in his view.\xc2\xa0 And so he supported Secretary Sebelius\xe2\x80\x99s decision, having not played a role in the making of the decision.</p>\n<p>We have been through a legal process and the court has ruled against the administration -- an appeals court -- as you know, and that ruling means that -- or meant that Plan B would be immediately available to anyone of any age.\xc2\xa0 And it was the decision given that court ruling to proceed with making the simpler version of Plan B available, because at the very least that addresses some of the concerns about the ability of younger girls to use that medication.</p>\n<p>So the ruling came in against; the administration immediately made a form of Plan B available, and it was a decision that the President supports to proceed to making sure that the FDA approved the simpler version of Plan B.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What steps is the administration taking to ensure with defense contractors who work on intelligence issues that their employees -- that they have adequate safeguards against rogue insiders?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a couple of pieces to that question, some of which have been answered by the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence.\xc2\xa0 So there are several.\xc2\xa0 First of all, there\xe2\x80\x99s the damage assessment that\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, it is important to note that when it comes to contractors, they swear an oath to protect classified secrets just as government workers do.\xc2\xa0 And that is important to remember.</p>\n<p>In terms of procedures that are in place, I think I would refer you to the various agencies that have contractors that deal with classified information -- Department of Defense, NSA, CIA and the like -- in terms of the procedures that are in place or any procedures that they may be engaged in now in the wake of these leaks.\xc2\xa0 But again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that individuals who take an oath to protect classified information are bound by it, whether they are government employees or contracted employees.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is there anything new that the administration is doing, then, in terms of seeking extra assurances from contractors in the wake of what\xe2\x80\x99s happened?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think I would refer you to the agencies that employ contractors who have access to, once they have gone through all the rigorous background checks and other procedures to give them the security clearances that they have, and that they take the oath that they do, for any post-revelation measures they may be taking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could ask you about President Putin today -- he said he has no doubts about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.\xc2\xa0 What do you make of those comments?\xc2\xa0 What does the administration make of those comments and the importance of them, given Russia\xe2\x80\x99s place in the peace discussions and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 About Iran\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\'m sorry, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen those comments so maybe you can characterize them for me further.\xc2\xa0 No doubts in that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s pursuit is for non-peaceful means, military means?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly our view and it\xe2\x80\x99s been our view that Iran needs to abide by its international obligations.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, no doubts that Iran is pursuing this for nefarious intentions.\xc2\xa0 No doubts in terms of -- he said he has no doubts that Iran is pursuing a nuclear program for peaceful means.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, okay, so that\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite of what I thought you were saying.\xc2\xa0 Our views haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the comments by the Russian President that you just relayed to me, but I would say that Iran has failed to live up to its obligations under international law, to prove that its pursuit of nuclear technology is for peaceful means.\xc2\xa0 There is ample evidence to the contrary.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we are engaged in a process with our allies to try to bring about a change in behavior by the regime in Tehran.\xc2\xa0 And as part of that process, we have instituted the most stringent and broad sanctions regime in the history of the world.\xc2\xa0 And that is both unilaterally and with our allies, and through the United Nations and through different means.</p>\n<p>We have said that there remains time for Iran to choose a path of engaging with the international community and abandoning its nuclear weapons ambitions, but that that time is not unlimited.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously monitor the situation very closely with our allies.</p>\n<p>Dan.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that keeping America safe is more important than keeping the information of Americans secret?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you heard the President say on Friday, he believes that we must strike a balance between our security interests and our desire for privacy.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that you can not have 100 percent security and 100 percent privacy, and thus we need to find that balance.\xc2\xa0 He believes as Commander-in-Chief, that the oversight structures that are in place to ensure that there is the proper review of the kinds of programs that we have in place, authorized by Congress through the Patriot Act, and FISA do strike that balance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>He also said that he understands and believe it is entirely legitimate that some may disagree.\xc2\xa0 Some may believe that that balance ought to be shifted in one direction or the other from where it currently is, and he welcomes the debate about that.</p>\n<p>He mentioned this very explicitly in his speech to the National Defense University several weeks ago on the broader topics of our counterterrorism programs, but he spoke specifically about surveillance and the balance that we need to strike between security and privacy, between security and inconvenience.\xc2\xa0 And that is a worthy discussion to have in public and he welcomes that debate, because it\xe2\x80\x99s an important debate.</p>\n<p>And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that we have had this debate every time the Patriot Act has come up for passage and reauthorization.\xc2\xa0 And it has been a spirited debate with strongly held opinions expressed by people who are opposed to the structures that are in place that have been authorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress, that are overseen by the courts, as well as internally by the executive branch.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s important and it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy and we should continue to have that debate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\'t it true, though, that security at times will have to take a backseat to -- or rather privacy will have to take a backseat to security?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\'ve answered the question that we have to find a balance between those two and that we cannot have, if we hope to successfully protect ourselves, a hundred percent privacy; that there has to be some modest concession to the need for information as we pursue terrorists who mean to do harm to the country and to take the lives of Americans; but that we need to make sure that the programs we have in place are properly overseen, that they are legal, that they are authorized by Congress and they are authorized by the courts.\xc2\xa0 And that is the case here and has been the case with the discussion that we\'ve had in the wake of these revelations.</p>\n<p>But again, I just want to emphasize that the fact that these systems are in place and the oversight exists and it is significant does not mean that the conversation has ended, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.\xc2\xa0 It means that we need to continue to debate this.\xc2\xa0 And as I said yesterday, this goes to sort of broader issues about our nation and the world, in terms of the nature of electronic communications and broader issues of privacy.</p>\n<p>So this is an important debate for us as a nation.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important, in the President\'s view, that we have the kinds of debates that we\'ve had in Congress over the Patriot Act and its reauthorization, the improvements to the Patriot Act that ensure that there was oversight that had not existed prior to 2006 I believe, and then the measures that have been taken to ensure that there\'s judicial and executive branch and congressional oversight since.</p>\n<p>So the President certainly does not welcome the way that this debate has earned greater attention the last week.\xc2\xa0 The leak of classified information about sensitive programs that are important in our fight against terrorists who would do harm to Americans is a problem and it is a great concern.\xc2\xa0 But the debate itself is legitimate and should be engaged.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And about the congressional picnic that has been postponed -- what was behind that?\xc2\xa0 Did sequester play into that decision at all?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, this was a -- I think had to do with the President\'s schedule and the fact that he is, as you know, taking several overseas trips in June, and that necessitated trying to postpone this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker of Tennessee, is urging the President to arm Syrian rebels at the earliest possible time.\xc2\xa0 What is your response?\xc2\xa0 And is Senator Corker correct when he says the President is facing a critical policy decision on Syria this week?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been evaluating his policy options on Syria repeatedly for some time.\xc2\xa0 There are a number of issues that we\'ve discussed here that have to do with the use, potentially, of chemical weapons by the Assad regime and the need to build on the evidence that we have already accumulated, that that in fact has taken place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Then there is the issue of how best to achieve our policy goal, which is a negotiated political settlement to an authority in Syria that can provide security and stability; that can protect the rights of all Syrians; and that can secure unconventional and advanced conventional weapons; that can counter terrorist activity; and that can keep the state and its institutions preserved to the extent possible.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the policy goal that we have as a nation, a policy goal we have with our allies and partners on this issue, and then we evaluate the options available to us in a very challenging situation based on whether or not they will bring us closer or inadvertently move us further away from achievement of that policy goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President is, as you know and as he has said, reassessing those options.\xc2\xa0 One of the options that he has not taken off the table and that we continue to assess is the potential of providing arms to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 We already have provided an enormous amount of assistance to both the Syrian people, through humanitarian assistance, as well as to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 But we evaluate every other option.\xc2\xa0 The one exception to that, although all options remain on the table, is the President has made clear that he does not foresee a circumstance where we would have American boots on the ground in Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what about the timing?\xc2\xa0 What about this week?\xc2\xa0 Is there a policy decision we should be expecting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any policy announcements to preview for you or forecast, except to say that the situation in Syria is obviously serious and it continues to deteriorate.\xc2\xa0 And that is of great concern to the President and to everyone with an interest in Syria and the region.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to discuss this with our allies and partners.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So has the President or his administration sent any messages to Nelson Mandela or his family this week?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of any communications from the White House, where obviously he is and the First Lady is.\xc2\xa0 And we all are concerned about Nelson Mandela\'s health and wish him and his family well and hope that he recovers.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow on that, please?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the Johannesburg part of the trip the President is going to take later this month basically for the President to go see Nelson Mandela?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, April.\xc2\xa0 I think that that understates significantly the importance of South Africa and the bilateral relationship we have with that country.\xc2\xa0 There is every reason to visit South Africa on a visit to Africa.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any specifics on the schedule or the plan for the President\'s trip beyond what we\'ve put out already.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, we understood it that Johannesburg was added.\xc2\xa0 It was supposed to be Cape Town for South Africa, and then Johannesburg was added.\xc2\xa0 And Nelson Mandela, at that time, was in Johannesburg.\xc2\xa0 And the question was how this is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifics on a schedule that\'s still coming together to provide to you, except to say that we\'re obviously concerned about Nelson Mandela\'s health, and wish him well and a speedy recovery.\xc2\xa0 But we obviously also have a very important relationship with South Africa.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When was the last time President Obama talked with Nelson Mandela, particularly as both of them really are the essence of the first black President for the United States and for South Africa?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an answer to that question in terms of the last time they spoke.\xc2\xa0 I know they did meet when President Obama was a senator.\xc2\xa0 And the First Lady was in South Africa and met with Nelson Mandela when she visited South Africa a few years ago I believe.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know when the President last spoke with Mr. Mandela.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he feel a kinship with him because of their historical placing in these two respective countries?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the President has written about and spoken about Nelson Mandela in the past.\xc2\xa0 So I would point you to what he said about this hugely significant figure in South African, African and global history.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, does the United States want to prosecute Mr. Snowden?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is an investigation underway, and it is for the investigators to determine whether or not crimes have been committed and to decide what charges, if any, will be brought.\xc2\xa0 And I will not get ahead of that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t so far.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have said -- well, Bill, I appreciate the opportunity to glibly get ahead of an important investigation but I\xe2\x80\x99ll pass on it.\xc2\xa0 I think that we have made clear that we have very serious concerns about the leak of classified information about programs that are very important to our national security. But on this specific investigation and the status of the individual who\xe2\x80\x99s being investigated, I will leave comment on that to the investigators.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner today called Snowden a traitor.\xc2\xa0 Would you go that far?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t comment specifically on someone who\xe2\x80\x99s under investigation.\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t characterize him or his status.\xc2\xa0 We believe it is the appropriate posture to take to let the investigation move forward and let the determination about where that investigation will go and whether any charges will be brought and what those charges might be if they are brought to the investigators, to the FBI and the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about this debate, you\xe2\x80\x99ve said the President welcomes the debate and you\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to his speech at the National Defense University.\xc2\xa0 One of the takeaways from that speech, in his own words, was that he felt it would be a mistake for the U.S. to stay on what he called a war footing, that it was sort of self-defeating.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the lesson that we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned over the last couple of weeks after that speech is that we still are on the war footing?\xc2\xa0 In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s expanded surveillance to prevent terror attacks.\xc2\xa0 So when you cite that speech, isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a bit of a contradiction there?\xc2\xa0 When he was telling the public two or three weeks ago we\xe2\x80\x99re kind of ramping down, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want a war footing anymore, the expanded surveillance suggested we still are on a war footing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\xe2\x80\x99re conflating a number of issues here, Ed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- that was a fairly long and detailed speech that delved into a number of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the messages was that we\xe2\x80\x99re scaling -- that we\xe2\x80\x99re not on a war footing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think with regards to that, we have as a nation been in active, hot wars for more than a decade.\xc2\xa0 And the President, keeping his commitment from when he ran for this office, ended the war in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 And he is winding down the war in Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>But it remains the case that we continue to aggressively pursue al Qaeda and its affiliates.\xc2\xa0 And it is absolutely his obligation as Commander-in-Chief to do so and to ensure that we have the tools necessary to do that.\xc2\xa0 It is also his view and his insistence that those tools that we have and that we use are subject to oversight and are carried out and are used in a way that that keeps faith to our laws and our values -- with our laws and our values.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any inconsistency at all there.\xc2\xa0 We remain in conflict with al Qaeda.\xc2\xa0 Al Qaeda, even though it is greatly diminished -- core al Qaeda in particular -- remains a threat, and al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates remain a threat.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly discussed that quite a bit -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in Yemen or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0 And the President is taking every action necessary as Commander-in-Chief to ensure that we are adequately protected from that threat.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other topic.\xc2\xa0 CBS broke the story a couple days ago about the State Department -- about a memo from an official in the State Department inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office claiming that a special agent had \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined\xe2\x80\x9d that Ambassador Gutman in Belgium was ditching his security detail to engage prostitutes and to allegedly solicit sex with children.\xc2\xa0 He has sharply denied that. Is the President confident in the denial to keep Ambassador Gutman in place?\xc2\xa0 And what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the State Department allegedly shutting this down?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 These allegations are currently under investigation by an independent inspector general.\xc2\xa0 There is no final report on these inquiries by the independent inspector general.\xc2\xa0 And as in keeping with the position we take when we are dealing with independent inspector general investigations or audits, we will not comment until we have seen the results of that investigation.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s a process in place for reviewing any sort of allegation of misconduct the likes of which you mentioned, and we believe that that process should unfold under regular order, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to prejudge anyone or anything before all the facts are determined.</p>\n<p>That said, I want to make clear the President has zero tolerance for misconduct by any government employee.\xc2\xa0 And I think his zero tolerance for misconduct has been demonstrated amply throughout his presidency.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to prejudge based on unfinished investigations by an independent IG.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate that distinction.\xc2\xa0 One last thing on this, which is you say it\xe2\x80\x99s still under investigation, the allegations against the ambassador.\xc2\xa0 But there are also allegations in this memo against Patrick Kennedy, who\xe2\x80\x99s a very high State Department official, suggesting that he killed the original investigation, sort of blocked it, to protect Ambassador Gutman and maybe others.\xc2\xa0 My question is, does Under Secretary Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s conduct here, is that under investigation as far as the White House --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe all of these matters that you raise are under investigation, active investigation by the independent IG at the State Department.\xc2\xa0 And we will not prejudge the outcome of an ongoing inquiry like that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that same topic, Jay, is it appropriate that the State Department has gone so long, I think since 2008, without a fulltime inspector general?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information for you about the staffing of the IG\xe2\x80\x99s office, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take the question. What I can tell you is that -- if this related to the questions that Ed mentioned -- there is an active investigation --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not.\xc2\xa0 Just in general terms, the fact that the State Department --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This just occurred to you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, well, it\'s because it\'s State Department, it\'s Labor Department, it\'s Interior, Homeland Security, Defense, and I think it\'s the Agency for International Development all of which do not presently have full-time inspector generals.\xc2\xa0 So it would be a broader question I\'m posing.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'ll have to take the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 On a separate topic then, very briefly, I think Julie got to it quickly -- on Plan B, I know the situation has changed, but has the President\'s personal position on emergency contraception changed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\'s views are as he expressed them. Those are his personal views, and he put them in the context of being a father.\xc2\xa0 And he supported, again, the decision that Secretary Sebelius made at the time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the fact is, this case has been litigated; an appeals court has ruled against the administration, making available a version of Plan B immediately.\xc2\xa0 And it is the view of the administration that given that ruling and the availability of Plan B, it is in the best interests of the country that the simpler version be made available.\xc2\xa0 And if you\'re familiar with the ruling and the two different versions of the medication, I think that explains why we\'ve taken the position we have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, on one final topic -- Democratic Senator Wyden said of the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, that he, "didn\xe2\x80\x99t give straight answers on the NSA surveillance during a hearing that took place in March."\xc2\xa0 The President has called for open and honest debate.\xc2\xa0 I think Wyden says specifically that the American people have the right to expect straight answers from intelligence leadership to questions asked by their representation -- or their representatives.\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied that the American people are getting straight answers from their leadership when it comes to American intelligence?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he certainly believes that Director Clapper has been straight and direct in the answers that he\'s given, and has actively engaged in an effort to provide more information about the programs that have been revealed through the leak of classified information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because even James Clapper said it was the least untruthful statement -- he acknowledged that it wasn\'t fully truthful.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not sure what statement you\'re talking about.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This was the statement that I was referring to in the March hearing, where he was asked specifically whether all -- I have the direct language -- does the U.S. collect any type of data on all of the millions of Americans, and he said the answer to that was no.\xc2\xa0 He later sort of amended it.\xc2\xa0 But even -- in the conversation with Andrea Mitchell this weekend, he acknowledged that it was the least untruthful answer he could give.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think Director Clapper has -- in the last week has demonstrated -- has been aggressive in providing as much information as possible to the American people, to the press about these very sensitive and very important programs that are authorized by Congress under Section 702 and Section 215 of the Patriot Act -- a public statute, a much-debated public statute that has been passed into law and reauthorized I believe three times by Congress with bipartisan majorities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I would point you to the statements and documents that have been put out by the ODNI that demonstrate the effort that he has undertaken to provide a significant amount of information on these programs, given the revelations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>Mark Knoller, do you have something for me?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, let me ask you this -- what advice would the White House give --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I probably am going to regret -- (laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- to an official or somebody with a top-secret clearance who thinks there is wrongdoing underway?\xc2\xa0 What option does such an individual have to try and correct that?\xc2\xa0 What does such an individual do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s an important question and I appreciate it.\xc2\xa0 The Obama administration has demonstrated a strong commitment to protecting whistleblowers.\xc2\xa0 The whistleblowers can play an important role in exposing waste, fraud, and abuse.\xc2\xa0 There are established procedures that whistleblowers can employ that also protect -- rather ensure protection of national security interests.\xc2\xa0 And I would -- if you look at the history here, the President appointed strong advocates to the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board, who have been widely praised.\xc2\xa0 They have collectively issued an all-time high number of favorable actions on behalf of whistleblowers and have begun to change the culture so that whistleblowers are more willing to come forward.</p>\n<p>On November 27th, 2012, after four years of work with advocates and Congress to reach a compromise, the President signed the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, which provides whistleblower protections for federal employees by clarifying the scope of protected disclosures, expanding judicial review, expanding the penalties imposed for violating whistleblower protections, creating new protections for transportation security officers and scientists, creating whistleblower ombudsmen, and strengthening the authority of the Office of Special Counsel to assist whistleblowers.</p>\n<p>Because it was clear that Congress would not provide protections for intelligence community whistleblowers, the President took executive action, issuing a landmark directive that extended whistleblower protections to the intelligence and national security communities for the first time.\xc2\xa0 The directive prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers who report information through the appropriate channels and established procedures, including a review panel of IGs of other agencies to ensure that such retaliation does not occur.</p>\n<p>The President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment on this issue far exceeds that of past administrations, which have resisted expanding protections for whistleblowers and in doing so have steered away from transparency.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was quite an off-the-cuff answer.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just happened to have this available.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the -- are you willing to say whether you see Snowden as a whistleblower or a leader?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not willing to comment on the status of the individual under investigation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Is Secretary Kerry participating in an NSC meeting tomorrow on Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I was asked this yesterday about yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I can simply tell you that we have meetings here on Syria with some regularity.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to give a readout or preview of every meeting we have.\xc2\xa0 But given the seriousness of the situation there and the importance of Syria with regards to American policy, you can be sure that we have regular meetings on these issues that involve both principals and deputies on the National Security Council.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific meeting to announce from here because they are fairly frequent and routine.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fair to say that the White House is edging closer toward a decision meeting?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any decisions or announcements to make about policy, except to say that the President is constantly reviewing the options available to him and tasking his team to review those options with an eye towards what actions we might take that would bring us closer to the achievement of the goal that we seek.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one other topic -- on Snowden, can you describe a little bit about the damage he has caused?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I would refer you to the statements by the Director of National Intelligence, who is in a position to better assess that at the outset, and note that more comprehensive damage assessments are being done.\xc2\xa0 It is without question a matter of significant concern when we see leaks of highly classified information about very sensitive programs that are classified for a reason, that they are important to our effort to combat terrorists and extremists, and those who seek to do harm to our nation and take the lives of the American people.</p>\n<p>But for more specific assessments, I would refer you to the ODNI.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any idea how long that damage assessment -- do you think it\'s going to take long?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure.\xc2\xa0 I would ask them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria again, you reminded us that the President is constantly reviewing his options.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s the same thing in the European capitals and Ottawa, too.\xc2\xa0 Is there any concerted NATO option there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have a list of options to review for you since they\'re all on the table.\xc2\xa0 I guess you could assume that any option you might ask me about within reason and logic would be on the table.\xc2\xa0 What we tend to talk about here are what actions might be taken in response to assessments of more corroborated evidence about the use of chemical weapons, for example, what actions might be taken with regards to further assistance to the Syrian opposition given the circumstances in Syria and given the assessments we constantly make about what the impact of a decision like that would be.</p>\n<p>But I am not going to weigh in on specific options and whether they\'re being considered, because as the President has said, with a caveat on the exception of on the option of putting boots on the ground, the President has said all options remain on the table.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There are discussions also, are there with --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We talk about this issue with our allies and partners all the time, because it is of such great concern to the President and American political leaders in general, as well as the leaders in the countries of our allies and partners who have grave concerns about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Syria, grave concerns about the impact of the violence in Syria on the region, concerns about the involvement of Hezbollah and Iran in the fighting in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad.\xc2\xa0 These are all matters that are of serious concerns beyond the borders of Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell me if the State Department review report on Keystone XL is on the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s a process that is operated out of the State Department and I would refer you to the State Department for updates on --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, anything --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think you should take that question to the State Department.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on Syria again.\xc2\xa0 Considering the military gain achieved by the Syria government, what makes you confident that the Geneva talk will take place altogether?\xc2\xa0 And second, the U.S. is conducting military exercises with Jordan -- around 8,000 personnel.\xc2\xa0 Is this a plan B for Syria -- I mean, different kind of plan B?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me refer first to the -- that\xe2\x80\x99s clever -- (laughter) -- refer first to the question about Jordan.</p>\n<p>Jordan is a close friend and ally to the United States, and our militaries in particular have a longstanding relationship.\xc2\xa0 In reference to your question, a Patriot missile battery and F-16s are in Jordan in support of our annual joint exercise, Eager Lion.\xc2\xa0 And that is, again, an annual exercise.\xc2\xa0 So it not related to Syria or proposed options in Syria.</p>\n<p>On the first question, as I noted earlier, there is concern here and elsewhere about the deteriorating situation there, about the involvement of Hezbollah and Iran in the fight in Syria on behalf of Assad.\xc2\xa0 And the President is reviewing the options available to him when it comes to American policy, and working with our allies and partners on ways that we can assist the Syrian people and assist the Syrian opposition in trying to achieve the goal that we\xe2\x80\x99ve stated, which is a peaceful transition to a post-Assad Syria to an authority in place in Syria that respects the rights of all Syrians, that protects conventional and unconventional weapons, that combats terrorism and terrorists.\xc2\xa0 And it is in pursuit of that goal that we evaluate the options available to us.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you said all that, but what makes you confident that the Assad government will participate in Geneva, too?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the Geneva question, we are, as you know, working to convene a conference as soon as practical, which means as soon as it is determined, in partnership with the United Nations and with our international partners, that we have done the necessary preparations to bring the parties together and move forward towards a political solution.\xc2\xa0 And we are pursuing this, and we\'re pursuing a conference in Geneva.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we are not -- that is not the one track we\'re pursuing here.\xc2\xa0 The political process cannot occur in a vacuum.\xc2\xa0 There is ongoing fighting in Syria.\xc2\xa0 That is why we have, even as we continue our discussions with our allies, with the Russians, with the opposition about Geneva, the situation on the ground means that we continue to explore what more we can do to support the opposition as it confronts the tyranny of Bashar al Assad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the China summit?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 China summit?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 NSA and Donilon on Saturday had said that the President was going to follow the summit with some conversations with U.S. allies in Asia and that Donilon himself was going to have some meetings with representatives from those countries today.\xc2\xa0 Have any of those conversations happened yet?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no presidential interactions to read out to you, and I\'ll have to check about the National Security Advisor.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect anything today?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take the question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the NSA thing, it\'s obviously a big deal.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got members of the President\'s own party questioning what the DNI said about this.\xc2\xa0 This clearly has repercussions that are far more significant than some of the other things we\'ve talked about in the briefing room.\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t it time for the President to address the American people directly?\xc2\xa0 Isn\'t this sort of a litmus of leadership, to tell people when you\'re taking them in a new direction, and when they\'re confronted with these various challenges?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Glenn, the President took questions and answered them at length on this specific issue on Friday.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How many questions did he take?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think he answered for a total of 14 minutes; two multi-part questions on these issues that probably, given the standards here, that\xe2\x80\x99s six or eight questions.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is he will continue to discuss this, and he will continue -- he is interested in and believes in a debate about these issues and believes it\'s worthy and important to engage in that debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is this debate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I would just note, as I did earlier, that prior to these revelations, the President addressed this specific issue in a speech at the National Defense University --</p>\n<p>Q \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know about the magnitude of this.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, so you\'re saying you weren\'t interested until there were revelations?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think most Americans were not aware of this.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But, Glenn -- let me just say that the Patriot Act, which I know you\'ve heard of, is a public statute.\xc2\xa0 There is spirited and animated debate about the reauthorization of the Patriot Act every time it comes up for reauthorization, which includes, most recently, in 2011.\xc2\xa0 And the provisions under which -- the sections of the law under which these programs exist have been and are debated, and they have been, since the first reauthorization, updated in a way that made sure that oversight that did not exist over programs in the previous administration, in the first years of the previous administration, does exist.\xc2\xa0 And that was at the insistence of lawmakers including then-Senator Obama, that that kind of enhanced oversight by all three branches of government take place and exist with programs that are vital to our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Former Attorney General Mike Mukasey has said that the President ought to have a fireside chat with the American people about this.\xc2\xa0 Why not do that?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m not saying -- I think I just said -- Glenn, although I appreciate yours and the former attorney general\'s specific recommendations about the modalities of presidential communications -- the President has and will speak about this subject.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you just said now to Glenn and to answers today and yesterday, you\'ve referred us back to the President\'s speech at National Defense University.\xc2\xa0 Nowhere in that speech does the President specifically address the use of private contractors either for intelligence or for any of the other initiatives that the President was looking to address.\xc2\xa0 Is the President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve kind of missed the big story here.\xc2\xa0 But I grant that there\xe2\x80\x99s a question here about contractors, but the focus of the President --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- about the conversation we\xe2\x80\x99ve been having here is the balance between our security interests and our desire for privacy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and the question I was trying to ask was that is the President looking at this as an opportunity to reexamine the proportion or depth that private contractors have, including in our intelligence community?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that is an interesting question and perhaps worthy of debate as part of this conversation that we should be having.\xc2\xa0 I would note that contractors have long been involved in both our defense and intelligence efforts, and that when it comes to security clearances, they are subject to the same system of checks and security clearance procedures as government employees.\xc2\xa0 But, again, I -- which is not to be at all dismissive of the question, because I think that, too, is certainly a question that merits debate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the issue is if you are a private contractor and you take an oath to handle and protect classified information, you are under the same obligations as I am and Josh is and others here who have security clearances.\xc2\xa0 So the legal protections and the legal regime is the same, and the obligations are the same.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in an hour at National Defense University the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically mention private contractors once.\xc2\xa0 And this is now -- you say that he wants to have a conversation\xc2\xa0 --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I appreciate -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what point you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make.\xc2\xa0 The President gave a lengthy speech that was about specific issues like the use of --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you keep cutting me off.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to ask is the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention specifically contractors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve said that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the vacuum of that omission, the Snowden incident has filled that gap and so the President wants to have the conversation.\xc2\xa0 Does this conversation begin now on the contractors issue, which is up to 70 percent of intelligence gathering in some capacities?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that open a door that the President had left closed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that that is an issue, as I think I said in answer to your partial questions, that merits debate.\xc2\xa0 But whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a private contractor or a government employee, the issue of classified information and the obligations that individuals who take an oath to protect it have is the same, one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Two, it is certainly worth a discussion -- there has been discussion and debate in the past about the use of contractors in various other parts of the government, and that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth debate.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the issue of protecting our privacy and protecting our security, the balance that we seek remains the central issue regardless of the employment status of the individuals who take the oath to protect classified information.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on immigration, the President this morning talked about maybe potential changes to the bill.\xc2\xa0 Senator McConnell is looking for what he terms \xe2\x80\x9cmajor changes\xe2\x80\x9d in the areas of border security, benefits, and taxes.\xc2\xa0 Is the President open to any major changes to this bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President gave remarks about immigration reform just a few hours ago, and made the point that the bill that emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee represents an extraordinary amount of hard work by a bipartisan group of United States senators, a process in committee that allowed consideration of numerous amendments and passage of amendments with bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It does not represent letter for letter exactly what the President wants, nor does it represent letter for letter exactly what any individual Republican lawmaker or Democratic lawmaker wants.\xc2\xa0 But it does represent a strong consensus position on the central principles that the President laid out when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, and we strongly support that bill.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we look forward to a process that begins today of consideration on the Senate floor of comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 And we sincerely hope that as this bill is debated and as amendments are considered that the significant majority of lawmakers in the Senate who support comprehensive immigration reform -- reflecting the support that\xe2\x80\x99s out there in the American public and the views of the President -- prevail over any efforts to sabotage that, when we have, as the President said, a unique opportunity to address this challenge for this first time in many, many years.\xc2\xa0 And we do not want to miss that opportunity, an opportunity that will be good for the middle class, be good for our businesses, be good for our security.</p>\n<p>On one of the issues that is frequently raised when it comes to immigration reform -- border security -- it is important to note, A, that we have taken significant steps to enhancing our border security.\xc2\xa0 Since President Obama took office, we have I think the most boots on the ground on the border that we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had as a nation, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve doubled the number of border patrol agents.\xc2\xa0 And in addition to that, the bill itself that the Senate passed out of committee represents the most significant border security bill in our history in terms of resources allocated towards further border security.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s very important.</p>\n<p>It also makes clear that we have to have a clear path to citizenship for the 11 million illegals in this country -- illegal immigrants in the country, and that that path has to be clear because that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do for our businesses and for the middle class and for our economy.</p>\n<p>So the President, as you heard him say today, looks forward to a healthy debate in the Senate as they consider this important legislation; looks forward to bipartisan passage of that bill in the Senate and in consideration in the House, and ultimately passage by the full Congress.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President believe that the government is currently striking the right balance between privacy and security?\xc2\xa0 Is it getting it right?\xc2\xa0 And if so, why?\xc2\xa0 And if not, which way should it tilt more, privacy or security?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has addressed this, and so I will paraphrase him by saying yes -- (laughter) -- the President believes that -- thank you, Glenn.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we are striking the right balance, in his view, through programs that are subject, first of all, to debate, consideration and passage by Congress; and then subject to an oversight regime that involves all three branches of government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think it\'s important, whether it\'s Section 702 or 215, to be fully aware of the kind of oversight that exists when it comes to these programs.\xc2\xa0 And I\'d like to at this late date or late moment in my briefing to remind you of some of that oversight that exists -- if I have it here, which I may not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 While you search let me ask, why welcome the -- why invite all the debate?\xc2\xa0 If there is this debate now, if your position is --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because the President has made clear that he does not believe that just because he has come to the conclusion that we have struck the balance that is the right balance that that should end debate.\xc2\xa0 He believes that this is a subject where well-meaning and thoughtful people can disagree and that we ought to have that debate.\xc2\xa0 And we certainly are having it now and we should continue to have it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what I think is important to note, as we\'ve seen these revelations, is that there is a system in place with regards to these two programs that ensures that there is oversight by the judicial branch, by the legislative branch and by the executive branch to make sure that these programs as they are implemented\xc2\xa0 are done so in a way that is consistent with the law and with the guidelines that exist to ensure that there aren\'t -- that they don\'t run afoul over our laws or values.</p>\n<p>And depending on the programs -- the 215 program we talked about that is subject to renewal every 90 days through the courts, it is briefed and reviewed by Congress.\xc2\xa0 And similarly, with 702, there are procedures for both requirements for judicial consent and review, and for congressional review and notification and updates.\xc2\xa0 Additionally, there are procedures in place in the executive branch for monitoring these programs to ensure that in the implementation of the authorities granted by Congress, those who carry out these programs are doing so in a way that\'s consistent with our law, and with the values and the oversight regime that\'s in place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks very much, guys.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:01 P.M.
