EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for joining us today.\xc2\xa0 It\'s a testosterone-heavy crowd today.\xc2\xa0 Anyway, thanks for coming with us today.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we\'re headed to the Brent Spence Bridge, which is a bridge that connects Ohio and Kentucky.\xc2\xa0 It\'s an important bridge that has been declared "functionally obsolete," and is in need of repair -- which makes it, sadly, very common in the United States.\xc2\xa0 There are thousands and thousands and thousands of bridges and roads that are desperately in need of repair, which this President believes should be repaired as part of our effort both to put Americans back to work and to upgrade our infrastructure so that we can compete in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe is visiting this bridge in particular because it is symbolic of the overall need, the overall crumbling nature of our infrastructure, and it does span the two states, which are represented by the Speaker of the House and the Senator Minority Leader.\xc2\xa0 And the President is calling on Congress to pass the American Jobs Act, to put people back to work, to put Americans back to work, and to get this economy growing.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he is calling on both the Speaker and the Senate majority leader to join him -- Senate Minority Leader, rather -- to join him in getting this bill through Congress so that the benefits of the American Jobs Act can be felt as soon as possible by the American people.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask you about a story that the AP is reporting today about the New York Police Department targeting certain Muslim communities for surveillance.\xc2\xa0 This is something that began with CIA cooperation.\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any concern about what appears to be some kind of profiling scheme that\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I appreciate your question, and I have seen the story, but I don\'t have -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance to talk to the President about it, so I don\'t have a response.\xc2\xa0 I can try to get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you get back to me?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I may not talk to him about it today, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll get someone back to you on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue then -- this bridge is actually on schedule to be replaced in 2015.\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to create jobs in 2015.\xc2\xa0 Is the President suggesting, by being there, that somehow the Speaker and the Minority Leader aren\xe2\x80\x99t supportive of the bridge?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me make clear that the bridge is symbolic and representative of crumbling infrastructure across the country.\xc2\xa0 There are identified in the American Jobs Act -- the American Jobs Act includes a $50 billion immediate investment in construction jobs, rebuilding America\xe2\x80\x99s roadway, railways, transit systems and airports.\xc2\xa0 It will put people to work upgrading 150,000 miles of road, laying and maintaining 4,000 miles of train tracks, restoring 150 miles of runways, and putting in place the next generation aircraft control system that will reduce travel time and delays.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are just numerous, numerous projects.\xc2\xa0 This one is symbolic.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that if the American Jobs Act were passed, we could speed up the process of environmental and other approvals on this specific bridge.\xc2\xa0 But the overall point is -- the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to this bridge is we need Congress to pass the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And it is not a coincidence that we are going to a bridge that links the two states that are represented by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Minority Leader, who have it within their power to block passage of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 And they -- and we call on them instead to work with the President to get this Congress to pass the jobs act and put Americans back to work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOutside economists, as you know, independent of the administration, have said that the American Jobs Act would add up to 2 percent to the GDP of this country by next year and would add up to 1.9 million jobs.\xc2\xa0 Again, those are outside estimates. The point being it is irrefutable that the various components of the jobs act would give an incredibly important boost to the economy and an incredible boost to employment in this country.\xc2\xa0 And they are all the kinds of provisions that have been supported in the past by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, including the infrastructure provisions -- the kind of infrastructure programs that are outlined in the American Jobs Act are the kind that have traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, and we certainly hope they will in the future -- because this is the number-one priority that the President has and that the American people have.\xc2\xa0 They want Washington to help get the economy going again.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any reaction to the remarks by Iranian President Ahmadinejad in the United Nations General Assembly criticizing U.S. policy -- I believe he called it "colonial."</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our views on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and its vile mistreatment of its own citizens are well known.\xc2\xa0 I find it rich that the Iranian President would have such criticism.\xc2\xa0 Our position on that regime\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of its own people is well known.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And following up, do you have any reaction to the vote in the House on the CR?\xc2\xa0 And is the President concerned there might be a government shutdown?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re pleased to see the House reject attempts to put politics ahead of the need to help those who\'ve been so severely affected by numerous significant disasters that beset the country.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to Congress working -- coming together to ensure that the needs of those affected by disasters is taken of -- are taken care of.</p>\n<p>\n\t**Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is this the way to win the cooperation or support from Republican leaders, though, like McConnell and Boehner? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be better to bring them along on a trip like this, invite them on Air Force One, consult with them?\xc2\xa0 Could this be interpreted as showing them up, in a sense, appearing in their districts without them?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the members of Congress, both parties\xc2\xa0 -- the Republican Party, the Republican leadership, as well as rank and file members -- know exactly where the President stands. And he is calling on them to support the provisions of the American Jobs Act, as they have in the past -- whether it\'s extending the payroll -- extending and expanding the payroll tax cuts that put $1,500 in the pockets of the average American family next year; giving the -- cutting in half the employer side of the payroll tax cut that would get small businesses growing and hiring; the incentives in the American Jobs Act to get small businesses hiring -- either increasing wages or making new hires, or hiring veterans; and then the infrastructure programs that we are talking about today.</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- the issue here is not one of persuasion.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one of -- in terms of negotiations between leaders or rank and file members.\xc2\xa0 It\'s making clear the urgent demand that the American people have that Washington, instead of getting in the way of the things that can help our economy, take action to help our economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the markets the last -- yesterday and today also.\xc2\xa0 They\'re down about 6 percent so far.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s concern central banks are really running out of tools to head off a recession.\xc2\xa0 Any comment?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously monitoring these things. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to comment specifically on markets.\xc2\xa0 But as you know, the President had bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Cameron and President Sarkozy yesterday in New York at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 He also spoke on Monday with Chancellor Merkel.\xc2\xa0 And in all of his conversations with European leaders, as well as the conversations that Secretary Geithner has had with his counterparts in Europe, he has reiterated that he believes that the Europeans have the capacity and the wherewithal to deal with the issues that confront them.\xc2\xa0 And he has encouraged them to take forceful and decisive actions to do just that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President happy with the pace at which the Senate has taken up the American Jobs Act -- or not taking it up?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is the Senate has been dealing with issues that go directly to the urgent need that we face, which is ensuring that Americans are either put back to work or not thrown out of work; whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the extension of the FAA bill, or the highway transportation -- surface transportation bill, other measures that obviously the Congress has to deal with in terms of a continuing resolution ensuring that government functions and operates.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are comfortable and confident that the Congress will take up the American Jobs Act and hopefully pass it in its entirety as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President have any reaction -- does the White House have any reaction -- to the letter that the Speaker and the Minority Leader sent to Ben Bernanke in advance of the actions that they took to help the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any comment on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Schumer is introducing a bill today to force the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator.\xc2\xa0 Are you guys okay with --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the bridge -- is this specific bridge getting funding through the jobs act?\xc2\xa0 You said that if it\'s passed it could speed up environmental regulation, but is it actually getting funding?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The process by which specific projects get funded through infrastructure measures is not predetermined.\xc2\xa0 The point of going to this -- as I understand it, the point of going to this bridge is to draw attention to the urgent need that we have in this country to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, and by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, we can put people back to work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are thousands upon thousands of potential projects out there -- projects out there that the American Jobs Act would fund through the three different provisions that relate to agriculture in the American Jobs Act, and this bridge is representative of the kinds of problems that our infrastructure faces and the dramatic needs that are out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the fact is that there are out-of-work construction workers around the country who are ready to go to work on these projects, and we have the opportunity here -- Congress does, if it passes the American Jobs Act -- to put those Americans to work.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You would agree that this project wouldn\'t get going even if the jobs act passed until 2013?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is my understanding that -- in terms of where it is in the pipeline, that\'s the case.\xc2\xa0 But we have never suggested that this project would be -- that ground would be broken on this project immediately.\xc2\xa0 It is symbolic.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re being -- we\xe2\x80\x99re very transparent about why we\xe2\x80\x99re going to this bridge.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to this bridge because it spans a river that divides the two states which are represented by the Speaker of the House and the Senate Minority Leader.\xc2\xa0 We need their -- the President is calling on them, the leaders in Congress of both parties, to work with him so that Congress passes the American Jobs Act, puts Americans back to work and grows this economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tThank you very much.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t1:58 P.M.
