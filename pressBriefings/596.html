EST</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Before we get started, I just wanted to talk about an important aspect of the President\'s trip to New Orleans today.\xc2\xa0 As you know, we got the latest jobs from the Department of Labor.\xc2\xa0 Those jobs numbers have indicated that we\'ve now been creating jobs in this country for 44 consecutive months, a total of 7.8 million jobs.</p>\n<p>Just in this past month alone, there were 212,000 jobs created in the private sector.\xc2\xa0 And for the third quarter, that\'s an average of about 152,000 private-sector jobs per month.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an indication that our economy is continuing to make good progress in its recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, the other thing that the jobs report showed is that our economy took a hit, as a result of the government shutdown and the brinksmanship that Congress played with the debt limit just last month.\xc2\xa0 The jobs report indicated that there was an uptick in unemployment.\xc2\xa0 The jobs report indicated that there was an increase in the number of people who reported being temporarily unemployed.\xc2\xa0 These are the kinds of self-inflicted wounds that our economy needs to avoid.\xc2\xa0 The American people are counting on their representatives in Washington, D.C., to put in place policies that will support the recovery, not undermine it.</p>\n<p>Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s one last aspect of the report that is notable, which is the report indicated that there were 11,000 construction jobs that were created last month.\xc2\xa0 Over the course of the last year, 185,000 construction jobs had been created.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\'s important progress, but it is 1.9 million construction jobs below the peak before the economic downturn.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ve got quite a ways to go.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One common-sense way that we could put people back to work would be investing in modernizing our nation\'s infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 The Port of New Orleans is one good example where wise investments could, in modernizing that port, could lead to job creation, good construction jobs there in the New Orleans area.\xc2\xa0 But what\'s important is there\'s a multiplier effect.\xc2\xa0 The port itself is a key component of our nation\'s international trading system -- that millions of tons of products are transported out of this country through the Port of New Orleans to markets overseas.\xc2\xa0 That supports millions of jobs in this country.</p>\n<p>And the President has made exports and increasing our exports a focus of his economic growth strategy.\xc2\xa0 So there is an opportunity for us to make a front-end investment in our infrastructure, in ports like the one in New Orleans that will not just create jobs in the short term, but also lay a foundation where we\xe2\x80\x99re creating jobs over the long term, many of them, all across the country, as we strengthen our trading relationships and make the transport of American products from American to overseas markets more smooth and more efficient.</p>\n<p>So that\'s some of what the President will be talking about in New Orleans today, and it is a key component of the President\'s strategy for strengthening the economy and creating good jobs for middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 So with that, I\'ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>Roger, do you want to start?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you update us on Iran talks?\xc2\xa0 And has the President talked to Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, I don\'t have any specific calls from the President to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 As was reported overnight, Secretary Kerry has traveled to Geneva, where he will participate in some of the conversations that are ongoing there.\xc2\xa0 He is participating in those talks in the hopes that he can play an instrumental role in narrowing the differences that currently exist between the P5-plus-1 and the Iranians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I don\'t have any additional updates to provide to you beyond sort of observing that that is the current state of affairs.\xc2\xa0 And if there are more details to report out, I would anticipate that my colleagues who are traveling with the Secretary in Geneva would be able to keep you apprised of them on a short-term basis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Israel is completely rejecting the deal that seems to be emerging.\xc2\xa0 Netanyahu says that Iran got everything and had to pay nothing.\xc2\xa0 So what do you make of your closest ally saying that this is something that would make their safety be a risk?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 One thing that\xe2\x80\x99s important for everybody to understand is that there is no deal.\xc2\xa0 The reason, as I just mentioned to Roger, that Secretary Kerry has traveled to Geneva is to see if he can narrow the differences between the P5-plus-1 -- which is the United States and our negotiating partners -- and the Iranians.\xc2\xa0 So any critique of the deal is premature.</p>\n<p>It\'s also important for observers in this process to not lose sight of the fact that the United States and Israel are in complete agreement about the need to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 The Israelis have expressed their serious concerns because of the threat that Iran having a nuclear weapon would pose to their nation\'s security.\xc2\xa0 The nation of Israel is a close ally of the United States, so we obviously are concerned about their security, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But Iran having a nuclear weapon would also have a terribly destabilizing impact on the broader Middle East.\xc2\xa0 This is already a very volatile region, and having one country with a nuclear weapon, like Iran, that has been very combative and engaged in some inflammatory rhetoric would be destabilizing throughout the entire region.\xc2\xa0 The last thing we need to see is a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>So there are a couple of very good reasons why it\'s important for Iran not to obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 And you have seen this President play a leading role in the effort to put in place sanctions that are bringing Iran to the negotiating table.\xc2\xa0 The only reason that Iran has come to the negotiating table to explore the possibility of demonstrating to the international community that their nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful means is because there is a very tough sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s in place, both bilaterally between Iran and the United States, but also a set of multilateral sanctions that have taken a severe toll on the Iranian economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we have seen -- there\'s now an Iranian -- now the Iranian leadership is responding to that, to the pressure of those economic sanctions, and coming to the table and seeking to resolve this dispute with the international community in a peaceful way.</p>\n<p>So we\'re going to consider those conversations.\xc2\xa0 But just to be clear, let me begin where I began, which is there no deal in place, and the whole reason that Secretary Kerry has traveled to Geneva is to see if he can narrow the differences that currently exist between the Iranians and the P5-plus-1.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the modest easing of sanctions that the United States would consider offering in this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of any of the discussions that currently underway there.\xc2\xa0 But what we have said about the relief that we would consider is that it would be proportional to whatever concessions the Iranians themselves make.\xc2\xa0 The relief that would be provided would be completely reversible.\xc2\xa0 This is not an open-ended proposition that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering here.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the other thing that we are resolved to is protecting the broader architecture of the sanctions program.\xc2\xa0 That sanctions regime architecture has been critical to bringing the Iranians to the table.\xc2\xa0 This sanctions architecture has put enormous strain on the Iranian economy, has put enormous strain on the Iranian leadership.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s the reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re having these conversations right now.\xc2\xa0 So it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense at this point to start taking this architecture apart.</p>\n<p>But in terms of the details, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of what they\xe2\x80\x99re talking about, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be any more specific about that from here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the Israelis with the Saudis as well have expressed concerns about any rapprochement with Iran.\xc2\xa0 How do concerns from important allies in the region temper the U.S. approach to making any deal with Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think a lot of what I said about Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s comments applies to the concerns that have been raised by the Saudis, which is it is in the interest of the United States and our allies all across the world and in the region that Iran not obtain a nuclear weapon.\xc2\xa0 That is precisely the effort that we are engaged in right now, which is to force the Iranian regime to live up to their international obligations, particularly those obligations that are guaranteed by the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\xc2\xa0 There are also obligations that Iran has to the United Nations Security Council that they failed to meet.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States and President Obama are determined to ensure that the Iranians live up to those obligations.\xc2\xa0 The President has played a leading role in putting in place these sanctions that have taken a terrible toll on the economy, that have put pressure on the Iranian regime to bring them to the table to come into compliance with those obligations.</p>\n<p>So we have a very clear, I think what you could describe even as a pretty transparent strategy, and that strategy has made some really important progress.\xc2\xa0 We have a situation where the Iranians are at the negotiating table, and we do feel like those negotiations are progressing.\xc2\xa0 But there is no deal, but there is an opportunity here for a possible diplomatic solution, and that is exactly what the President is pursuing -- a diplomatic solution that would lead to the kind of guarantees that the international community could be confident in, could be confident that the Iranian regime is living up to their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 This would be transparent inspections, intrusive inspections that would guarantee some transparency into the program so that the Iranian regime could guarantee to the international community that their nuclear program exists for exclusively peaceful purposes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President last night mentioned, when he apologized for problems with the cancellations of policies, that he was going to instruct his administration to go back with some sort of a loop.\xc2\xa0 Can you flesh that out?\xc2\xa0 What are you guys looking at in terms of canceled policies?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to add a whole lot of additional detail to what the President said last night.\xc2\xa0 The President did acknowledge that there are some gaps in the law that need to be repaired.\xc2\xa0 He has directed his team to consider some administrative solutions to those problems, some steps that his administration could take unilaterally that would address some of those gaps.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he looking at any legislation?\xc2\xa0 And then, is he talking to Senator Landrieu, who is aboard the plane with us today?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us anything about the conversations they might be having?\xc2\xa0 She has a bill out that would make a fix.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Senator Landrieu is on the plane, and I know -- I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a little bit about her legislation.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any specific details from any conversation she had with the President to tell you about.\xc2\xa0 But suffice it to say that the President is determined to address some of the challenges from this law.</p>\n<p>The whole reason that the President fought so hard to get the Affordable Care Act passed is because he believes firmly in the priority that all Americans should have access to quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that 80 percent of Americans get their health insurance through their employer or through Medicare or Medicaid, or through the VA.\xc2\xa0 Other than additional consumer protections falling into place, they\xe2\x80\x99re unaffected by the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 There are 15 percent of Americans who are currently uninsured, but now for the first time have access to quality, affordable health care.\xc2\xa0 And in some cases -- in many cases, in fact, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see some Americans get some tax credits to help them afford that health insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>In terms of the 5 percent of the people who are in the individual market, we are committed to, again, making sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re putting in place some specific consumer protections that will prevent insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, that would prevent insurance companies from charging women double just because they\'re women.\xc2\xa0 So there are important protections that the President remains committed to.</p>\n<p>But that\'s the whole reason that we\xe2\x80\x99re working so hard to fix some of these flaws, because the President believes firmly in the importance of the goal we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And does he just want to look at administrative fixes, or are you open to legislative changes as well?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President has said for years now that he is open to working with members of Congress that have a genuine interest in trying to strengthen the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been true for years now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s true today.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s one other thing I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- I also want to mention here that the President touched on during his trip to Texas, which is in the interest of pursuing quality, affordable health insurance for people all across the country, the President put forward a proposal to expand Medicaid that would put the federal government on the hook for covering 100 percent of the expansion of Medicaid.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s something that Governor Perry had resisted in Texas, and the President talked about that in Texas.\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to let this trip go by without pointing out that we\xe2\x80\x99re actually traveling to two states today, the great state of Louisiana and the great state of Florida, where you have Republican politicians who are blocking the expansion of Medicaid in those two states.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\'t make any sense.</p>\n<p>In Louisiana, at the beginning of this year, there would be 265,000 people who would get access to affordable health care if Republican politicians weren\xe2\x80\x99t blocking Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 In the state of Florida, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about 848,000 people who, as of the first of the year, would have had access to health insurance if Republican legislators weren\xe2\x80\x99t blocking that effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there are a number of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged in, and one of them is trying to encourage Republican officials at the local level to stop playing politics with people\xe2\x80\x99s health care and actually take advantage of programs that are going to bring much needed relief to families that desperately crave it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the extension of the enrollment deadline one of the things you\xe2\x80\x99re considering in one of these fixes he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, we are at the end of five weeks -- at the end of the fifth week of a six-month enrollment period.\xc2\xa0 The experts who are focused on fixing the website have indicated that they expect that the website will be functioning smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of this month.\xc2\xa0 If that deadline is met, that means that there will continue to be -- there will still be another four months left in the enrollment period for people to use the website, to visit the marketplaces, to find out if they qualify for tax credits, and for the first time take advantage of quality, affordable health insurance that\xe2\x80\x99s available on the individual market.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that previously hasn\'t been in place.</p>\n<p>And we\'re confident that once we get this website fixed, that people will have four months in which to do that, which, when you compare it to the open enrollment period that typically exists for people who get health care through their employers, four months is actually a really long time.\xc2\xa0 When you compare it to the Medicare open enrollment period -- which I think is only four or six weeks -- a four-month enrollment period is still a substantial period of time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s primarily the grandfathering issue that you\xe2\x80\x99re fixing?\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a loophole, is it?\xc2\xa0 The President has called it a loophole.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what -- the President was asked this specifically last night, and I think he referred to it as a gap in the health care law.\xc2\xa0 And there are a variety of things that we\'re considering to try to address that gap.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that there are -- that many people who are receiving cancellation letters right now, about a million of them are people who otherwise would qualify for Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 So there are some options for those people who are receiving cancellation letters.</p>\n<p>A number of the people who are receiving cancellation letters would actually qualify for tax credits to help them afford health insurance.\xc2\xa0 A number of the people who are receiving cancellation letters will have access to -- when they go and look at the online marketplace -- will have access to health care plans that are as good as the plan that they currently have, but they can purchase it for the same price or less.</p>\n<p>So one of the other challenges that we face is educating people about this system.\xc2\xa0 I know that Consumer Reports has talked about this a little bit, that some of the reporting that we\'ve seen about people who are worried about the cancellation letters they\'ve received, when they\'ve actually learned the facts about the options that are available to them, they\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that they\xe2\x80\x99re actually ending up in a pretty good place here because of the new protections that are in place because of the Affordable Care Act, because of that new tax credits that people can benefit from that will help them afford quality health insurance.</p>\n<p>So one of the other challenges that we have over the course of the next four months is educating people about the options that are available to them -- options that were created by the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Iran, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Is the President making any calls from the plane on Iran?\xc2\xa0 Or has he spoken to Secretary of State Kerry to offer guidance, thoughts, instructions?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any calls from the plane to read out at this point.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has spoken to Secretary Kerry today.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t believe that he has.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have any calls to Secretary Kerry to read out at this point.\xc2\xa0 But if there are calls and we\'re in a position to read them out, then I\'ll make sure that you guys get them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we expect to see former Florida Governor Charlie Crist here today, later in Florida?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what Mr. Crist\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is today.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll take a look at that.\xc2\xa0 Once we get down there, I\'ll have a better sense.\xc2\xa0 And there will be press access to at least a couple of the fundraisers that the President is doing, so you get a chance to look for yourself.\xc2\xa0 If I see him in some setting in which you\'re not allowed, I\'ll try to flag it for you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support his candidacy?\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know if -- well, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Crist is somebody who was a very strong supporter of the President\'s re-election.\xc2\xa0 And the President was certainly pleased to have his support.\xc2\xa0 Then-Governor Crist, as you know, famously worked closely with the President to implement the Recovery Act, which was very important in helping the economy across the country and the economy in Florida bounce back from the worst recession since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>In terms of the governor\'s race in 2014, I don\'t have any endorsements to announce at this point.\xc2\xa0 I\'m actually not even sure that the field is set in that race, so I don\'t want to get ahead of the game on that front.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President is going to talk about exports today.\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. still on track to meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s goal of doubling exports by 2015?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I haven\'t seen the latest numbers on this.\xc2\xa0 I think the latest numbers indicate that exports have increased by more than 50 percent since the President took office.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t know what that 50 percent refers to in terms of when they\'re drawing that line.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get back to you with some more specific numbers.\xc2\xa0 But what you can report in terms of the President\'s record on exports is that exports have increased by 50 percent since he took office.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have anything on the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting yesterday with John McCain?\xc2\xa0 What did they talk about, and how did it go?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a specific readout.\xc2\xa0 I know that they were planning to sit down to talk about a range of issues, including touching base on the latest efforts to pass bipartisan immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I know that the President is in regular touch with Senator McCain and has the opportunity to talk to him on a fairly regular basis.\xc2\xa0 But I didn\'t talk to him about the specific conversation that they had now, other than confirming that the early description of the topics covered in that meeting is accurate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you say whether Todd Park will testify before Congress on the Affordable Care Act?\xc2\xa0 And can you also talk about what his role was in implementing the website?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, Mr. Park was subpoenaed by Chairman Issa to testify before his committee.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s something a little ironic about that request, because Mr. Issa has talked repeatedly about the need to get the website fixed quickly, and so for him to pull away a person who is critical to that effort to testify before Congress might cause some to wonder about the motivation for the request for testimony.</p>\n<p>At this point, it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Park\xe2\x80\x99s intention to stay focused on the work to repair the website.\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean -- but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s also willing at some point down the line, in the months ahead, to appear before the committee and to talk about the efforts that they\xe2\x80\x99ve undertaken to try to get a handle on the website\xe2\x80\x99s problems and to put in place some fixes by the end of November.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he resisting the subpoena for now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that a subpoena has been issued, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s just been a request from Chairman Issa in the form of a letter.\xc2\xa0 And right now it\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Park\xe2\x80\x99s intention to stay focused on the task at hand that Mr. Issa himself said was important, which is getting the website fixed as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that he won\xe2\x80\x99t testify unless he is subpoenaed?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that right now the plan is for Mr. Park to continue his work in fixing the website.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he won\xe2\x80\x99t appear before the committee at some future date.\xc2\xa0 But right now the plan is for him to stay on the job of getting the website up and running as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Senator Landrieu is being criticized for traveling to Louisiana with the President but then not appearing at the event with him.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to Senator Landrieu about it.\xc2\xa0 I did read in some local report that she has another event in another part of the state today.\xc2\xa0 You should check with her.\xc2\xa0 But my hunch is that she is strongly supportive of the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to promote investments in the Port of New Orleans and in other infrastructure projects like it that are so critical to the economy not just in the New Orleans area, but all across the country.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But you can check with her on that.\xc2\xa0 I would point out the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the Mayor of New Orleans, will be with us for at least part of this trip today, because he does believe that important upgrades at the port would be beneficial to the local economy here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible) to the minimum wage if you\xe2\x80\x99re planning on getting behind the Harkin-Miller bill, or what the efforts are to sort of get behind that now?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The President, in his State of the Union address, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall, made a point of talking about his support for increasing the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that hard work in this country should lead to a decent living.\xc2\xa0 And there are too many people out there who work very hard for the minimum wage, at a minimum wage level.\xc2\xa0 That means they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to raise a family either at the poverty line or just a little bit above it.\xc2\xa0 That is not the kind of economy that we should have in this country.\xc2\xa0 If there are people who are out there working hard to put food on the table for their family, they should be able to earn a decent living.</p>\n<p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President supports increasing the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 And it is fair for you to say that the administration is supportive of the Harkin-Miller bill that would increase the minimum wage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does the President feel about the U.S. being stripped of our vote at UNESCO?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I actually have not seen those reports, Josh, so I\'ll have to get back to you on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a sketch for tomorrow, what we can expect?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 At this point, the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any public events tomorrow, but as we learn more about the President\'s schedule we\'ll give you an update.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, the President in the interview last night seemed to stop short of voicing full confidence in Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 Was there anything that he meant by just saying that she\'s done a good job, but not offering a full-throated endorsement?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, nothing has changed about the President\'s full confidence in Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 I think you might be over-reading just a little bit into his comments.\xc2\xa0 But, no, the President has full confidence in Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 I think the President himself pointed out why, which is that she has undertaken a very difficult challenge, which is, in a difficult political environment, put in place insurance marketplaces that are producing results for people.</p>\n<p>There are people who are able to sign up for insurance on the individual market and can get tax credits to help them afford it.\xc2\xa0 And what we\'re finding is that those insurance policies, because of the competition between insurance companies, those policies are being offered at a very competitive rate.\xc2\xa0 And that is a testament to the hard work of the people at HHS.\xc2\xa0 There are many Republicans, you\'ll remember, who doubted whether that was even possible.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that has been a strong success in states all across the country, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the hard work of Secretary Sebelius.\xc2\xa0 But her top priority right now is mobilizing the resources and putting a team together to fix problems with the website.\xc2\xa0 They\'ve made progress on that and they\'re making steady progress, but they\'ve got some work to do to meet their deadline, which is to get the website up and running smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of this month.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President have any comment on the FDA rules on trans-fat?\xc2\xa0 Is that something he talked about with you?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I did see the news coverage of that, but I haven\'t talked to the President about it, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what his view is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The First Lady?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Check with her office.\xc2\xa0 I bet they do have a comment.\xc2\xa0 Anything else?\xc2\xa0 I do have a quick week ahead.</p>\n<p>And the most important thing is, really, Monday is Veterans Day.\xc2\xa0 So as you know, the President and First Lady traditionally on Veterans Day have hosted a breakfast for veterans from across the country.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing that again on Monday.</p>\n<p>Later in the morning, the President will travel to Arlington National Cemetery where he will participate in a wreath-laying ceremony and deliver remarks there.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, the President will address the 2013 Tribal Nations Conference.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On Thursday, the President will travel to Philadelphia where he\xe2\x80\x99ll participate in a campaign event for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then, on Friday, the President will participate in more meetings at the White House.</p>\n<p>All right?\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:29</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
