MSK</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\'m just going to do a readout of the meeting between the President and Prime Minister Abe of Japan, and then can take a few questions on that.</p>\n<p>The President and the Prime Minister began with a discussion of the situation in Syria, building on the conversation they had over the phone earlier in the week.\xc2\xa0 I think the two leaders are in agreement that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and demands a strong international response.\xc2\xa0 They agreed to stay in close coordination on the issue as we move forward.\xc2\xa0 And I imagine we\'ll be continuing to discuss Syria on the margins of the summit with Japan and beyond the summit as well.</p>\n<p>They discussed a range of alliance issues.\xc2\xa0 On the economic side, they discussed TPP and the importance of concluding an agreement by the end of the year, and they discussed some of the issues that need to be addressed as a part of the effort to reach that agreement by the end of the year and noted the importance of the APEC Summit next month as a milestone on the way to that process.</p>\n<p>On North Korea, the two leaders underscored their commitment to work together towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0 The President noted the importance of close trilateral cooperation between the United States and Korea and Japan, as well as continued efforts with other members of the six parties, including China and Russia, and the broader international community.</p>\n<p>They discussed the Senkakus and the President made clear that he was opposed to any effort to resolve the Senkakus issue through coercion and underscored the importance of diplomacy and dialogue, which Prime Minister Abe referenced as his preferred course of action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>They also agreed to consult on broader defense issues in the alliance.\xc2\xa0 They agreed to stay in close contact as Japan reviews its own defense posture going forward, and noted the importance of the upcoming two-plus-two meetings with Secretary Kerry and Secretary Hagel meeting their Japanese counterparts.\xc2\xa0 And they discussed the need to continue to move forward to implement our shared plan on the Futenma realignment associated with U.S. forces in Japan.</p>\n<p>And with that, I can take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the Japanese sign on to the need for a military response to what happened in Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t want to speak for the Japanese; I\'ll let them speak to their position.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that the U.S. and Japan were in agreement that there needs to be a response, that the international norm surrounding chemical weapons needs to be upheld.\xc2\xa0 And in the spirit of our alliance, we have -- I think the two leaders have an expectation that we\'ll be able to reach a shared position on Syria.</p>\n<p>So, again, it was a productive discussion in that regard, and we welcome Japan\xe2\x80\x99s continued insistence that there be a response to the use of chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was there anything that the President was asking Abe for as it relates to Syria?\xc2\xa0 You had talked in the gaggle earlier about looking for political and diplomatic assistance.\xc2\xa0 Is that like the kind of thing he was looking for from him?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The question was, was the President asking for anything related to Syria.\xc2\xa0 I think that there are two aspects to that, Julie.\xc2\xa0 First, with respect to chemical weapons, I think what we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see are countries coming forward to take the position that we have taken that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable; that while we have a preference for the U.N. Security Council resolving these issues, the Security Council has been paralyzed, and that, therefore, there needs to be an international response to the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to discuss with Japan and other countries the type of political support that they can express for that position going forward.</p>\n<p>But the broader situation in Syria -- they did discuss Japan\xe2\x80\x99s continued support on the political and humanitarian side. And I think the commitments from other countries to help deal with the humanitarian crisis, including the refugee crisis, is important, and Japan has been a contributor in terms of helping neighboring countries absorb refugee flows and help provide humanitarian support to the Syrian people.\xc2\xa0 And the Prime Minister expressed his desire to continue to work on those issues with the United States and other countries.</p>\n<p>And similarly, on the Geneva process, which provides the ultimate pathway towards a political resolution to Syria\xe2\x80\x99s civil war, Prime Minister Abe expressed his strong support for working on behalf of that process going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything further on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s interaction with Putin?\xc2\xa0 And second, did the President get any additional Syria support so far today?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 With respect to Mr. Putin, they obviously greeted one other at the beginning of the summit as they were coming in.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I have no updates on any scheduled interactions between the two of them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll be interacting within the context of the summit.</p>\n<p>And on your second question, the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t seen other leaders on the matter of Syria since he\xe2\x80\x99s been here other than Prime Minister Abe.\xc2\xa0 So I think we had a good meeting with Prime Minister Abe.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re encouraged by Japan\xe2\x80\x99s position on Syria.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to consult closely with them.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know -- clearly, the President will have interactions on the margins of the summit that touch on Syria, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on those going forward.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re in the early stages here.</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President been making personal phone calls to members of Congress on the Hill while he\xe2\x80\x99s here?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding that -- I was asked this morning and I owe you guys a list.\xc2\xa0 So he is going to be doing outreach on the Hill, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll email you guys those calls as we get them compiled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A question about Japan.\xc2\xa0 Did the President specifically talk about the military action?\xc2\xa0 And, secondly, do you have a sense that you got support for military action from Japan?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 The President did update Prime Minister Abe on the type of action that we\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating in Syria and the strength of our views that the Syrian regime must be held accountable.\xc2\xa0 Again, we had I think a broad expression of support from the Prime Minister on what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do in terms of enforcing an international norm around chemical weapons.</p>\n<p>Again, I want to let the Japanese government speak to its formal position on these matters, but our general sense was it was a positive meeting and the two leaders will be able to continue to consult closely on these matters going forward.\xc2\xa0 So again, we felt like we had very positive signal from Japan on its commitment to upholding this international norm and to the notion that there\xe2\x80\x99s need to be international response.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll let them to speak to any more details associated with their position.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, as a general matter, we would like to see public expressions of support from countries that are invested in the international norm prohibiting the use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 So we would like to see on a political and diplomatic level countries insisting that the international norm against chemical weapons be upheld.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99d like to see an acknowledgement that, while the U.N. Security Council is the preferred course of action, that we cannot be paralyzed by the inaction of the Security Council either.</p>\n<p>And so I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working over the course of the next two days on the margins of a summit that is dedicated to economic issues to enlist continued support politically, diplomatically from other countries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, as I said earlier today, we would never expect to achieve full consensus among the countries here because Russia just takes a different position on the issue of Syria generally. But in terms, in particular, of our friends, our allies, our partners around the world, we believe it\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to raise their voices on behalf of international norms that countries around the world have signed onto for many years.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a question about the dinner tonight.\xc2\xa0 Can you give any preview of what the President hopes to say about Syria?\xc2\xa0 Putin said in his opening remarks that there would be some discussion over the dinner about Syria, and I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what the President plans to say and what kind of case he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make to the other world leaders.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 So on Syria, what the President will be saying is the same case he\xe2\x80\x99s been making to the American people he\xe2\x80\x99ll be making here on the world stage when Syria comes up, which is, first of all, that the international norm against the use of chemical weapons is fundamental to global peace and security; that it\xe2\x80\x99s manifested in agreements like the Geneva Protocol and the Chemical Weapons Convention that express a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons; that in order for the prohibition of chemical weapons to mean something, there needs to be enforcement associated with that norm.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll reiterate his very strong confidence that the responsible party for the use of chemical weapons was the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 We have as high confidence as we can have in terms of the U.S. intelligence community in the evidence that we have seen that points directly to the Assad regime as the responsible party.\xc2\xa0 We also have sarin samples that confirm through physiological evidence that a chemical attack occurred, in addition to the overwhelming abundance of publicly available information that points to a chemical weapons attack.</p>\n<p>And third, I think the President will speak to the notion that the United Nations has a critical role to play but that the United Nations Security Council has been paralyzed on this issue, so that we\xe2\x80\x99re not interested in simply drawing out a process at the U.N. that is not going to lead to a result.\xc2\xa0 And given the inability to pass any resolution at the Security Council associated with Syria in recent years, including three vetoes and including the inability to even move forward on a resolution that just expressed condemnation generally about the use of chemical weapons, we believe that we can\xe2\x80\x99t use our preferences for the United Nations Security Council as a reason to not take action to enforce this international norm.</p>\n<p>And then, lastly, I think the President will make the point that we are dealing with the issue of chemical weapons here.\xc2\xa0 The military response that we are currently calling for with Congress is focused on degrading Assad\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities and deterring future use of chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 But at the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s not intended to resolve all the issues in Syria because, frankly, we don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a military solution.</p>\n<p>So even as there may be differences with a country like Russia on the issue of how we respond to chemical weapons, ultimately we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to reinvest in a political process through Geneva, which is the existing framework, to bring about an end to the Syrian civil war.\xc2\xa0 And in our belief there\xe2\x80\x99s no way that a leader who has killed thousands of his people, including gassing many of them to death, will have legitimacy to lead on the other end of that process, which is why we think Assad needs to go.</p>\n<p>So I think those are the core points the President has been making and I expect he\xe2\x80\x99ll make the same case here on the international stage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, just one question.\xc2\xa0 Most of the allies -- there was a press conference this morning with the European Union and some other leaders in Europe -- are aligned with the U.S. in attacking and criticizing the use of chemical warfare.\xc2\xa0 The difference is how to respond.\xc2\xa0 And the general position that we gather from Europe, except from France, was why don\xe2\x80\x99t we try to get sanctions?\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we try to punish Syria in a different way and so without a military attack?\xc2\xa0 So should that prevail as a line?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And should Russia support a resolution with very strong sanctions would the U.S. consider not proceeding with a military attack?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 We believe that the nature of this chemical weapons attack is such a flagrant violation of the international norm prohibiting the use of chemical weapons that it demands a strong response, and in this instance a military response -- albeit a limited military response.</p>\n<p>This is the case we\'ll be making to our European allies.\xc2\xa0 We have had political support from them for the notion that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and demands a response.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve had expressions of support from a country like France, which has indicated an interest in potentially being a part of an operation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But at the same time, when you talk about sanctions, I think the U.S. and the EU have basically thrown the book at the Assad regime in terms of sanctions.\xc2\xa0 Early in the conflict we moved in a coordinated fashion to cut off Assad from the European and American economies.\xc2\xa0 And I will say that the European efforts in that regard have had a significant impact on the revenues that the Assad regime is able to access.</p>\n<p>In the past, the United Nations Security Council has failed on several occasions to pass a Chapter 7 resolution imposing any sanctions.\xc2\xa0 So we simply do not foresee the U.N. Security Council acting any differently in this instance, given Russia\xe2\x80\x99s support for the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 And we do believe that the level of violation committed by Syria merits a response that imposes a deterrent military cost on the regime, because if there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense from Assad that he can use these weapons with impunity, that emboldens him to use chemical weapons, that emboldens future dictators and terrorist groups to use chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0 It risks unraveling the prohibition against the use of chemical weapons, which could put citizens and parties in conflict in the future in far greater harm.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s further destabilizing to a region in which the United States has a number of close allies and partners, such as Turkey, Jordan and Israel.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is a report that Prime Minister Abe invited officially President Obama to visit Japan.\xc2\xa0 So what is President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s response?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 He did extend that invite, and what the President said -- he always likes to go to Japan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been there twice as President, obviously traveled before, so he would very much like to go to Japan and accept that invitation.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of determining at what point in the future it makes sense to go forward with that visit.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s just something that we\'ll have to work out.</p>\n<p>Clearly this year, the President has a full schedule in Asia, so we\'ll look for opportunities in the future to be able to have the President return to Japan and accept that invitation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Until our schedule is done it\xe2\x80\x99s still an open question.\xc2\xa0 I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s intention is to find a time to accept that invitation, though, and that\'s what he expressed to the Prime Minister.</p>\n<p>I\'ll take one more on Japan and then -- yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 About economic issue, there is a growing concern among the emerging market economies about the impact by a possible slowdown of U.S. monetary policy, and I think this issue is going to be discussed in the G20 meeting.\xc2\xa0 So how will the USA respond to such a concern?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the U.S. took several steps including our central bank associated with monetary policy as we were seeking to rebound from a grave economic crisis.\xc2\xa0 As we moved on to a firmer footing in terms of economic growth and job creation, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen adjustments made in those policies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99d just say a number of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, obviously the United States government -- the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t set the policy of the Federal Reserve, so these are not decisions made by the President.\xc2\xa0 Secondly, he believes that there are different things that each country can do here within the G20 framework to invest in economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99ve consistently said is even as we deal with long-term fiscal imbalances, countries can take different types of steps to promote investment or to provide their own investment in growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>And so we\xe2\x80\x99ll discuss in the G20 session what types of steps can be taken not just in Europe and the United States, but in the emerging economies to promote growth.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also said repeatedly that when you look at emerging economies, increasingly they will have to look within their own borders for demand.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the rebalancing of global growth that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed for four and a half years now, so that there\xe2\x80\x99s steps that can be taken so that emerging economies can find growth not just from consumers in the United States, but from within their borders.</p>\n<p>The only last comment I\xe2\x80\x99d make is as a veteran of these G20s, in the past, there was criticism of the U.S. position on issues like quantitative easing.\xc2\xa0 I think that what has been demonstrated is we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued a pro-growth policy, and we believe that that ultimately is good for the global economy, because when the U.S. economy is growing it helps provide momentum more broadly.\xc2\xa0 But, at the same time, we cannot be a substitute for demand that is generated in other countries.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done any vote counts.\xc2\xa0 I think any assessment done at the beginning of this was that there was just a lot of undecided members who wanted to receive more information.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re very pleased with the trend lines.\xc2\xa0 I think each day what you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is different members coming out on a bipartisan basis to support an authorization to use military force.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a resolution reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with strong bipartisan support, running the spectrum from a Senator McCain to a Senator Boxer.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen other important leaders in the House come out in support of an authorization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing each day is an increasing number of members who are convinced that a military response is necessary. But we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to make the case to members.\xc2\xa0 We understand the obligation that we have to provide them with information to explain our thinking, to explain the nature of the military action we\xe2\x80\x99re contemplating.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing that, and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a resolution passed.</p>\n<p>Just one more from Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President in his meetings in Sweden or today gotten feedback from counterparts about the step that he took to hold off on military action until taking this issue to Congress for authorization?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Not really.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think leaders of course are aware.\xc2\xa0 As a general matter, they\xe2\x80\x99ve expressed support for the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in terms of getting a resolution through Congress.\xc2\xa0 But he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had detailed discussions with them on our congressional process.</p>\n<p>I think that the world looks to the United States to lead on these issues.\xc2\xa0 And I think the President made an important point in his press conference yesterday, which is that oftentimes it\xe2\x80\x99s the United States that\xe2\x80\x99s looked to to do things when you have terrible circumstances like we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen within Syria and by necessity, we have to be out front in terms of enforcement on international norms.\xc2\xa0 And were the United States to not play that role, there would be a significant vacuum in the international community.</p>\n<p>So one thing for Congress to consider is the message that this debate sends about U.S. leadership around the world -- that the U.S. for decades has played the role of undergirding the global security architecture and enforcing international norms.\xc2\xa0 And we do not want to send a message that the United States is getting out of that business in any way.</p>\n<p>So I think one of the reasons we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see bipartisan support is that there\xe2\x80\x99s an understanding that this is about the situation in Syria and it\xe2\x80\x99s also about the leadership role that the United States plays in enforcing international norms.\xc2\xa0 And I think you saw that yesterday with the Prime Minister of Sweden saying that he understood President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s need to react precisely because the obligations of the United States in these matters has always gone beyond the type of actions that other nations have taken.\xc2\xa0 We want other nations to meet their responsibilities, too, though, and that responsibility is to stay invested in an international norm that has been constructed over many decades.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Pope wrote a letter for peace and against an intervention in Syria.\xc2\xa0 What is the response of the White House on this position?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d have to take a look. Clearly, we always welcome the views of the Catholic Church, which has a longstanding commitment to the promotion of peace.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d have to look at the letter itself.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben, can you take one more from the file?\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us, has the Brazilian President notified the President or the White House that she is cancelling preparations for a visit to the U.S. over her outrage over the NSA surveillance?</p>\n<p>MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of that.\xc2\xa0 I know that they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing each other -- I think they\xe2\x80\x99re sitting next to each other, actually, at the G20 session, so I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to talk.\xc2\xa0 I addressed this earlier today in terms of our commitment to work with them to understand their concerns around the NSA issue.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on any interaction he has with President Rousseff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t6:15 P.M.
