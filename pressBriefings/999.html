EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to see you on our way to Chicago.\xc2\xa0 Thought I would come by.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of quick things to flag for you.\xc2\xa0 And then if you have a couple of quick questions we can do a couple of those as well.\xc2\xa0 The first thing, the top priority on the President\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda is strengthening the economy and creating jobs here in the United States at this make-or-break moment for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 In the insourcing American jobs forum, he highlighted the decisions made by an increasing number of companies, both large and small, to bring jobs back and invest in America.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou heard the President mention a couple of ideas for increasing support and incentives for companies who are looking to invest in America, including ramping up the efforts at SelectUSA.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll lay out some additional ideas, including some good incentives for companies contemplating these kinds of decisions in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt reflects his unwavering commitment to working with Congress when possible, and acting unilaterally when necessary, to put in place a set of economic policies that reflects his vision for an American economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing is a scheduling announcement, and I wanted to give you a heads up on this but I would ask that you not report this until we arrive, which is that our first stop, once we get off the helicopter in Chicago, will be to travel to the Obama for America headquarters in downtown Chicago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo again, this is an unscheduled stop.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to give you a heads up for your planning.\xc2\xa0 Please don\xe2\x80\x99t report it until the motorcade pulls up to the headquarters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is being piped back to the White House, though, right?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not it\xe2\x80\x99s being piped back.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99d ask that people not report until they see a pool report from Mr. Gillman or Ms. Parsons.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, is this being piped back to the White House press room?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I have no idea.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did she ask?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Whether it was being piped back to the White House or not.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Presume that it is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why is he stopping by campaign headquarters?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It would be an opportunity for him to say hello and thank the people in Chicago who are working hard on his reelection campaign.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President himself and his staff at the White House has been focused on the critical priorities and the items on his agenda as President of the United States, and that the people who are working in Chicago and have been for the better part of the last year have been focused on his reelection, have ensured that he\xe2\x80\x99s had time to focus on his duties as President of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so this will be an opportunity for him to swing by the office to say hello to the staff that\xe2\x80\x99s been hard at work there and to thank them for their efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seems like a safe bet that people will read this as the President is, in fact, more focused on his reelection than on running the country.\xc2\xa0 Would that be correct or incorrect?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, essentially, they\xe2\x80\x99ll see, in your stories, that he began his day by -- at an insourcing forum in the White House, and that reflects that -- that item wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just the first thing on his schedule, it\xe2\x80\x99s also the first thing on his agenda and it\xe2\x80\x99s on the forefront of his mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs I began my remarks here, that the President is focused on his number-one domestic agenda item, is creating jobs and strengthening the economy at this make-or-break moment for the middle class, and that\xe2\x80\x99s where his focus remains.\xc2\xa0 And frankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s why we have a separate operation in Chicago, so they can be focused on the reelect while the President himself is focused on his responsibilities as the Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he been -- how many times has he been to the campaign headquarters?\xc2\xa0 And does he have any -- what were his thoughts on the Republican primary, given the fact that Mitt Romney has now had two consecutive victories?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on the number of visits.\xc2\xa0 I believe this is actually the first time that he will have visited the headquarters since the reelection operation got up and running.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of the New Hampshire results last night, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to handicap the race from here.\xc2\xa0 I asked the President, anticipating that one of you might ask me whether or not the President watched the returns last night.\xc2\xa0 He did not.\xc2\xa0 He has read about the race in the newspapers this morning, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has he heard any of the attacks that Mitt Romney has made on him?\xc2\xa0 Has he started to formulate in his head what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to say to those, if Romney ends up being the eventual nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly the President has been following the race by reading the newspapers.\xc2\xa0 But I got to tell you, I think that the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s formulating in his own mind are some ideas that he has for strengthening the economy and creating jobs.\xc2\xa0 This insourcing forum is certainly one of them.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m certain that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have some ideas that he\xe2\x80\x99ll lay out in the State of the Union address.</p>\n<p>\n\tThose are the things that are at the forefront of his mind.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not the reelect at this point.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he consider Romney to be the likely nominee?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to handicap the race at this point.\xc2\xa0 I have not heard him say that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to handicap the race.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys draw those conclusions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was the insourcing event designed to provide a contrast to the charges that Mitt Romney outsourced jobs at Bain?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The insourcing event was designed to highlight the decision that\xe2\x80\x99s being made by an increasing number of companies, both in America and around the world, that it makes sense to invest in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 We have the most productive workers, the most ambitious entrepreneurs and the greatest universities that prepare our workforce to compete in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the President was focused on today.\xc2\xa0 That was the reason for the event, because the President does want to encourage other companies to step up and take advantage of the opportunity that exists in the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any more details on the kind of -- the new tax breaks that the President plans to propose and what kind of incentives he plans to give companies to hire more in the U.S.?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that right now.\xc2\xa0 But we will in the weeks ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said the weeks ahead.\xc2\xa0 Is that something we should expect out of the State of the Union, perhaps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could it be before then, or will it not be until the State of the Union?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an exact release date for you, but certainly in the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0OMB -- the timing of the OMB replacement? Do you expect that to come before the State of the Union address?\xc2\xa0 And can you give us any more guidance or detail on how the President is formulating his decision, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s already been made, who it will be and when it will be announced?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about personnel appointments at this point.\xc2\xa0 Whoever will serve in that job as the director of the OMB will have big shoes to fill, taking over for Jack Lew.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a very important job; it\xe2\x80\x99s the senior member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic team.\xc2\xa0 But Mr. Lew will remain in that job through the end of the process that\xe2\x80\x99s currently underway to formulate a fiscal year 2013 budget.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in that office for another couple of weeks until the budget is finished, and then -- but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update for you in terms of timing about when a successor to Mr. Lew would be announced.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the decision will be made from the inside the administration?\xc2\xa0 You won\xe2\x80\x99t be bringing someone else from the outside for that position?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information about who Mr. Lew\xe2\x80\x99s replacement might be.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Daley is leaving after the State of the Union address, so is Jack taking over directly after that?\xc2\xa0 Or will there be some overlap there before he takes over?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding there will be some overlap, but that transition will occur at the end of the month.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s events are all fundraisers.\xc2\xa0 When do you expect the President will start doing campaign events that are not fundraisers?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date for you.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that at this point in time the President remains focused on his number-one job, which is serving the American public as the President of the United States.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on a wide range of things, from national security issues to certainly the strength and health and welfare of our economy, and putting in place the kinds of economic policies that will support an American economy that ensures everybody a fair shot and a fair shake.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s where his attention is devoted, and that\xe2\x80\x99s at the forefront of his mind.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific date for you about when campaign rallies will begin.\xc2\xa0 But at this point, there will be a time and a place for the reelection campaign to be fully engaged, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on the Iranian nuclear scientist who was killed in a car bombing, what reaction does the administration have to that?\xc2\xa0 And I guess does the administration consider this person an innocent victim here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports of the bombing.\xc2\xa0 The United States condemns this kind of violence.\xc2\xa0 I know there was a suggestion at some point that somehow the United States was involved.\xc2\xa0 That is categorically not true, and in fact this is the kind of violence that we would condemn.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of Mr. Roshan, the person who was killed, does the administration consider him to be an innocent victim here?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of information about the victim himself.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is, is that this is exactly the kind of violence that we unequivocally condemn.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any updates about the Keystone pipeline project decision-making?\xc2\xa0 The deadline for that is getting a little bit closer every week.\xc2\xa0 How involved is the President in that right now, and when can we expect to see a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on the timing of the Keystone decision.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the payroll tax cut extension legislation that the President signed gave him 60 days to make a decision.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the State Department about this, that it would be a -- they issued a statement back in December saying that 60 days would not permit them enough time to evaluate this project.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve actually seen some reports that the company itself has not actually even proposed an alternate route at this point.\xc2\xa0 So that sort of underscores the difficulty of evaluating and affirming this project within that 60-day window, considering that there\xe2\x80\x99s not even a route for that pipeline that\xe2\x80\x99s under consideration at this point, that\xe2\x80\x99s been proposed at this point.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of any sort of presidential -- any sort of administration announcement on the project, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update for you in terms of timing on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, got a question from back here.\xc2\xa0 On the first stop, will photo coverage be allowed?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to check on the press access for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Josh, this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s first fundraising trip outside of D.C. in the new year.\xc2\xa0 Is there any particular significance to it?\xc2\xa0 Was he bent on getting back to Chicago to start the new year for some particular reason?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it necessarily is pegged to the first trip of the year for fundraising purposes, but I can tell you that the President is pleased to enjoy a lot of support in his hometown for his reelection campaign; that there are a lot of Chicagoans who are -- who, as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see tonight, are committed to the President\xe2\x80\x99s reelection.\xc2\xa0 And the President is looking forward to the opportunity that he\xe2\x80\x99ll have tonight to visit with some of them.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And both Bill Daley and Valerie Jarrett are traveling with and will go to all of those events tonight.\xc2\xa0 Will they take part in any way?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I know that they will attend -- both Ms. Jarrett and Mr. Daley will attend the events this evening.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sort of role they may have at the events.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the mayor going to be there as well?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I would assume so, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s schedule is today.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the pool not going into the HQ?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the press access is going to be.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll check on it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.\xc2\xa0 Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we go wheels down, assuming that everyone is listening to this back home, if someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t honor the -- I\xe2\x80\x99m a little concerned about everyone knowing something and it getting reported on.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Maybe I have more faith in your colleagues than you do.\xc2\xa0 All right?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just on the payroll tax.\xc2\xa0 I mean, is there any schedule in place to begin negotiations, begin discussions with the House Republicans on this?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can tell you that the White House is regularly in contact with our counterparts on Capitol Hill.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific conversations to read out to you. \xc2\xa0But certainly, Christi made reference to the beginning of the calendar year.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the President\xe2\x80\x99s legislative agenda, this is at the top of it for the beginning of this year, making sure that we extend the payroll tax cut for the entire year of 2012.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in a little bit.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND<br/>\n\t4:53 P.M.
