Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0**Please see below for corrections, marked with an asterisk.</p>\n<p>\n\t12:48 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So with the --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0With that out of the way --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Week in review? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Exactly, week ahead. \xc2\xa0That would be okay with me, too. \xc2\xa0Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll go quickly here and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see if there are some other questions we can get through.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut, Darlene, do you want to start us off in phase two here?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Sure. \xc2\xa0A follow-up on the oil tax question. \xc2\xa0If something like that were to ever get through this current Congress, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t asking companies to pay $10 more per barrel of oil, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that somehow dent some of the progress the President was just out here talking about on the economy? \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consumers end up having to pay that? \xc2\xa0Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be passed off to them eventually?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that it does seem likely that oil companies would pass on at least some of that expense. \xc2\xa0But I think part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s point is that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing that energy costs are lower than they\xe2\x80\x99ve been in quite some time.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is precisely the time when we should capitalize on that opportunity. \xc2\xa0The truth is, the argument is stronger when energy prices are at an all-time high. \xc2\xa0But now we\xe2\x80\x99re in a situation where energy prices are a little bit lower. \xc2\xa0This is a smart time for us to start considering how we can make fiscally responsible investments in new technology, in more modern infrastructure, in transportation systems that run on renewable energy, investments in research and development that would allow us to strengthen the economy but also to transition to the low-carbon energy economy of the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Switching to another topic, are you aware that the Chairman of the House and Senate Budget Committees have said that they are not going to hold a hearing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal when he sends it up there next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I did see that announcement. \xc2\xa0It reminded me of the document that I\xe2\x80\x99ve referred to in this briefing a couple of times -- or in this briefing room at least a couple of times. \xc2\xa0The day after the election, Leader McConnell and then-Speaker of the House John Boehner wrote an op-ed that appeared in the Wall Street Journal, and the headline was \xe2\x80\x9cNow We Can Get Congress Moving Again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\tThis was their commitment to try to bring about some semblance of regular order to the legislative process. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ve done that with mixed results. \xc2\xa0And I guess the future is pretty dim if you have Republicans in Congress unwilling to even talk about the budget with the White House. \xc2\xa0We do see that Republicans are pretty eager to leap to the defense of the oil industry, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t really willing to have a serious, detailed conversation about our country\xe2\x80\x99s budget priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt says a lot of things, I think. \xc2\xa0It certainly does raise some questions about how serious Republicans actually are about governing the country. \xc2\xa0It also raises some questions about how confident they are in the kinds of arguments that they could make about the budget. \xc2\xa0Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re taking the Donald Trump approach to debates about the budget -- they\xe2\x80\x99re just not going to show up.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0To go back to the oil tax for a second, is that something that you are hoping to get in this final year? \xc2\xa0I mean, what was the purpose of putting it out there, knowing what the reaction would be from the Republican side?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, the purpose of a policy proposal like this -- and this is what will be included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget next week -- is you lay out your agenda, you lay out where your priorities are, and you lay out what you think is the best path forward for the country. \xc2\xa0So, again, I think this is the reason that you have budget hearings in the first place. \xc2\xa0The budget proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ll put forward will reflect what the President believes Congress should enact to move the country forward. \xc2\xa0But our expectation is not that Congress is just going to pass every single line item that\xe2\x80\x99s included in our budget. \xc2\xa0We should have a debate. \xc2\xa0And because Republicans are in charge of the Congress and the Democrats in charge of the White House, we\xe2\x80\x99re ultimately going to have to have a compromise. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we weren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly surprised that when we announced our oil fee, that Republicans leap to the defense of the oil industry. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an indication that the oil industry\xe2\x80\x99s millions of dollars in lobbying in campaign contributions are money well spent. \xc2\xa0They have people who are really looking out for them in the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re all Republicans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the President is the one that\xe2\x80\x99s looking out for middle-class families, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to put forward ideas that we believe are in the best interest of our economy and middle-class families. \xc2\xa0And many of those ideas are included in -- will be included in the budget, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t even want to have a conversation about it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally, it\xe2\x80\x99s being released on Tuesday. \xc2\xa0Tuesday is the day of the New Hampshire primary. \xc2\xa0Was there not another day the budget could be released? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, to be blunt, there was a conversation about releasing it on Monday, but typically there is a lot of work that is done a day in advance of the budget and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want all of you to have to work during the Super Bowl.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re looking out for your best interests, even when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like we are. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\tAyesha.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Moving on to Syria, how concerned are you that Russian and Assad forces are poised to take Aleppo? \xc2\xa0I mean, at this point, tens of thousands of Syrians are fleeing the city. \xc2\xa0And it looks like the city could soon fall under a full government siege. \xc2\xa0So is that a concern for the administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It does look like a terrible humanitarian situation inside of Syria is poised to get worse, and that is something that we continue to be quite concerned about. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been concerned for some time that the Assad government has been targeting innocent civilians in areas that are held by the opposition -- by opposition forces. \xc2\xa0And this is a good example of that. \xc2\xa0Those operations are leading to the loss of thousands of innocent lives. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re leading to violence that has caused the displacement of millions of Syrians from their homes and their communities. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s created a refugee migration problem not just in the region, but broadly around the world. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the continued support by the Russians of the Assad regime only makes it possible for the Assad regime to expand that violence, and it sets back our efforts to try to reach the kind of political transition that the Russians themselves acknowledge is necessary. \xc2\xa0So, it\xe2\x80\x99s tragic. \xc2\xa0But it certainly is not going to prevent the United States from continuing to push forward the political transition process to try to get Assad out of power so that we can begin to address the political chaos that\xe2\x80\x99s the root of so many problems in that country.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another topic. \xc2\xa0Some of my colleagues have a story out today about mutual fund investment in gun companies. \xc2\xa0And it revealed that President Obama -- even President Obama has a stake in gun makers through -- indirectly -- through these, I believe, a pension fund, albeit it is a very small stake. \xc2\xa0How does the President feel about the fact that all of these mutual funds and other investments are being made into gun companies because they have been so profitable during his administration? \xc2\xa0Is this something that he has given any thought about? \xc2\xa0And especially that it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for even people who want more gun control or who may be opposed to investment in gun companies to avoid it because so many mutual funds are involved with these companies.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that report, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware with the intimate details of the President\xe2\x80\x99s investments that sounds like include a pension fund that may be at least partially invested in a gun manufacturer. \xc2\xa0I know there has been a grassroots attempt in a variety of places, including on some college campuses, to encourage mutual funds and other institutional investors from investing in gun manufacturers. \xc2\xa0And the President has not hid from a willingness to criticize gun manufacturers that he believes, in some cases, are acting unscrupulously.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut our focus has been, frankly, on common-sense things that can be done. \xc2\xa0And we would welcome more support from gun manufacturers for some of the common-sense measures that we have advocated. \xc2\xa0Things like closing the gun show loophole. \xc2\xa0Things like closing the no-fly, no-buy loophole that allows individuals who are on the terror watch list to go ahead and walk into any gun store in America and purchase a gun. \xc2\xa0So there are some common-sense things that we can do, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a specific position on sort of these grassroots efforts, but I will just say, more generally, that the President does believe that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need to see more passion behind the grassroots movement to bring about the change in gun policies that the President would like to see. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of where we are on it.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustin.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back to something the President just said. \xc2\xa0Do you know if he misspoke when he said that the oil tax fee would be on both imported and exported barrels? \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s different from what was said on the call yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I go and check that fact. \xc2\xa0I noticed that he said that, too. \xc2\xa0So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go and make sure we can get you some clarity about how the policy would be applied.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0My second question kind of follows off of that, so maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll take that one as well. \xc2\xa0But if the U.S. levies a tax on imports but not on exported barrels of oil, is there a possibility that that\xe2\x80\x99s a violation of WTO rules or NAFTA or any of the other --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I take both those questions and see if I can get you a direct answer to that question.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There were a couple other things. \xc2\xa0I wanted to ask you about the explosion on the plane in Somalia. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you guys have talked about that yet. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can confirm that the U.S. government has assessed that the bomber was related in some way to al-Shabaab, if the U.S. is doing anything to aid the investigation, and if we\xe2\x80\x99ve stepped up or taken any precautions in the aftermath of the attack.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated assessment to share with you. \xc2\xa0I know that there has been some work done through a variety of channels to try to learn more about this particular incident. \xc2\xa0We have seen ISIL figures -- or ISIL-affiliated organizations try to carry out attacks against the commercial aviation. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of this risk. \xc2\xa0But at this point, I don\'t have a firm assessment to offer.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And we\'re not taking any new security steps?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0At this point, no. \xc2\xa0But obviously as we learn more about what exactly happened on that particular flight, it could lead to additional steps. \xc2\xa0We\'re always updating our posture with measures that sometimes are readily noticeable to the public and sometimes aren\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo if there\xe2\x80\x99s a public announcement about a change in security posture at airports that\'s necessary, that would be an announcement that would come from DHS and TSA. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any announcements that they\'re planning in the short term as a direct response to this particular incident.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And the last one. \xc2\xa0The CDC set off the firestorm this week by releasing a document that said women of child-bearing age shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consume alcohol unless they were taking birth control. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- this has obviously generated a lot of controversy -- if you guys think the CDC kind of misstepped by releasing that document.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the CDC sort of describe the science behind this. \xc2\xa0I think that their general effort was to try to communicate with the public about the significant risks that are associated with consuming alcohol early in a pregnancy. \xc2\xa0But for the most effective ways to prevent that, I\xe2\x80\x99d defer to the expertise of the scientists at the CDC.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So does the White House then agree that women of child-bearing age who aren\xe2\x80\x99t on birth control shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t consume alcohol?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, this is a scientific conclusion -- or at least guidance -- that was issued by the CDC. \xc2\xa0And people should certainly consider that view and that guidance. \xc2\xa0But ultimately people are going to make up their own mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Yesterday, we barely needed an egg timer to wait for the Republican leadership to say that the $10 oil fee was DOA. \xc2\xa0The President said they always say that. \xc2\xa0But does that mean the administration is standing by the proposal?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Absolutely, absolutely. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ll --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- it will overcome the leadership position on that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to do if they won\xe2\x80\x99t even meet with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director, that\'s for sure -- because this is a proposal that\'s included in our budget. \xc2\xa0But if Republicans are scared of that debate, I guess that is something that you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask them about. \xc2\xa0This is a position that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to advocate for. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s clearly in the best interests of our economy, both in the short term and over the long term when you consider the need to transition to the low-carbon economy of the future and the need to do that in a fiscally responsible way. \xc2\xa0That\'s exactly what we\'re laying out.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I guess the other thing is this: \xc2\xa0We would welcome additional ideas from Republicans. \xc2\xa0If they say that they have a better, more fiscally responsible way to make the kind of investment that\'s needed in modernizing our infrastructure, then we\'re happy to consider their ideas, too. \xc2\xa0But this is an idea that we think is a good one that we\'re putting on the table. \xc2\xa0But, no, I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anybody here that was surprised about the fact, again, as I mentioned, that the Republican Party -- Republicans in Congress are eager to leap to the defense of the oil industry. \xc2\xa0If only they shared that passion for defending the middle class, our jobs numbers would look even better than they already do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, they say they are because they say it will raise the price of gasoline by a quarter a gallon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I guess you\xe2\x80\x99d have to ask the oil industry if they\xe2\x80\x99d be prepared to pass that cost on to their customers. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if they say yes. \xc2\xa0They are the ones that can render judgment about that. \xc2\xa0I think there are a couple of other --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you be surprised if they said yes?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry? \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised if they said that they would pass on the --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, why do you --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, I would not be surprised if they said that they would pass on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut what this debate also uncovers is that there are currently significant costs that are incurred by middle-class families, by businesses, and by our economy based on the infrastructure that we currently have; that not updating our infrastructure has significant costs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI know that this is something that Secretary Foxx talked about yesterday. \xc2\xa0American businesses lose almost $30 billion a year because they don\'t benefit from a modern infrastructure; that shipments are delayed; that products don\'t move as efficiently through our transportation system; or that the costs associated with moving those products through the transportation system is higher because the system is not as efficient as it could be. \xc2\xa0And that is a cost that could be eliminated or at least significantly reduced if we were making a smarter investment in our infrastructure. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I guess the question is: \xc2\xa0Where are we going to pay this cost? \xc2\xa0Our view is that by investing in our infrastructure, we can lower these hidden taxes, but also create jobs and improve our economic prospects over the long term by having a modern infrastructure in this country.</p>\n<p>\n\tRon.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President mentioned wages are rising. \xc2\xa0But was there much more evidence -- and various proposals -- but was there much evidence in the report that the income inequality gap is narrowing? \xc2\xa0Is there more -- I don\'t know whether it\xe2\x80\x99s true or not that there\xe2\x80\x99s more progress at the bottom than at the top, or if it\xe2\x80\x99s just spread out across the economy. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look that deeply in the numbers, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can have an economist touch base with you about that. \xc2\xa0I think what the President was citing -- that over the last six months, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen wages grow at a rate of about *2.5 [2.9] percent, which is the fastest that they have grown in recent years. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a positive indication that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing wage growth starting to accelerate.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what we want to do is to try to continue to maintain and even build on that momentum, given the context of the political debate. \xc2\xa0Trying to put upward pressure on wages has been a core component of the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic strategy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s satisfying to see that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to make some important progress. \xc2\xa0But many of the proposals that the President discussed in answering Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question would have the positive impact of continuing to put upward pressure on wages.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything about people at the very bottom -- the poverty rate, which has been persistently high, as well. \xc2\xa0It just seems to be -- the good news seems to be for the economy broadly, but not for the people at the very bottom.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think the increase in the participation rate is an indication that people up and down the income scale are entering the workforce. \xc2\xa0And the good news is that last month, 158,000 private sector jobs were created. \xc2\xa0So they\xe2\x80\x99re finding jobs. \xc2\xa0Increased wages is certainly something that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help those who are at the bottom, but there\xe2\x80\x99s more that we can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President talked specifically about raising the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0Right now, if you\xe2\x80\x99re working -- even if you have a job and you\xe2\x80\x99re working full time and you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to raise a family of four, you are raising that family below the poverty line if all you\xe2\x80\x99re being paid is the minimum wage. \xc2\xa0That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sort of reflect the values in this country, where hard work should lead to a good paycheck. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one thing we could do to address those at the bottom. \xc2\xa0This is not something that Republicans by and large support.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President also talked about some longer-term things -- things like early childhood education, opening the doors to a college education to middle-class families and those families that are trying to get into the middle class. \xc2\xa0I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that that would have an impact on next month\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers or even next year\xe2\x80\x99s jobs numbers. \xc2\xa0But if we want to make sure that the next generation of Americans has access to even more opportunity, there are some common-sense things that we can do.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on the Aleppo question, as well -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a report that the Saudis are going to mobilize a ground force of several thousand to intervene in Syria. \xc2\xa0Is that true? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, for exactly what the Saudis meant and what they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to offer up, you should check with them. \xc2\xa0What they are responding to, however, is a specific request that Secretary Carter made of countries who are participating in our counter-ISIL campaign to ramp up their commitment.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so we certainly welcome the announcement from our partners in Saudi Arabia that they\xe2\x80\x99d be prepared to ramp up their commitment militarily to this effort. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear to me about whether or not this would be a significant contingent of ground troops or if they have in mind a deployment of Special Operations forces like the commitment that the United States recently made. \xc2\xa0So for the texture around that, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Saudis.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I think this is a positive indication that our requests for a greater commitment are being answered in the affirmative by our partners in the counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Are there other commitments you can point out beyond that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have new commitments to announce, but I do know that -- I believe as early as next week -- I\xe2\x80\x99m just looking at this -- yes, next week, Secretary Carter will be traveling to Brussels where he will be meeting with about two dozen of his counterparts from nations who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0The Saudis will be a part of that discussion. \xc2\xa0It will be an opportunity for Secretary Carter to re-up his request for additional commitments. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point whether or not we\xe2\x80\x99ll have announcements out of that meeting, but that certainly would be a place to look for one. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that given that Aleppo seems to be about to fall and that the political process of negotiations seems to be stalled that it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming increasingly clear that there needs to be a bigger military response on the ground from the allies -- from the U.S.-led coalition in order to really not lose the day there? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say a couple things about that. \xc2\xa0I think our principal concern about Aleppo right now is there\xe2\x80\x99s the possibility that government forces backed by the Russians would encircle that city and essentially lay siege to that city. \xc2\xa0And that would obviously exacerbate a terrible humanitarian situation there. \xc2\xa0So that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99re definitely concerned about.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking for a long time, for certainly more than four or five months now, about how the Russian military strategy inside of Syria undermines the goals of their political strategy. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that the efforts of the Russian military to buck up and strengthen the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s grip on power only gives the Assad regime less of an incentive to come to the negotiating table and act constructively in conversations there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo this is a sticking point. \xc2\xa0And it is one that does impede us making progress. \xc2\xa0Now, at the same time, the Russians do have -- because of their support for the Assad regime, they do have some leverage with the Assad regime. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that they can use that influence to get the Syrian government to be more constructive at the negotiating table. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, we also need to do some work with the opposition forces to get them to engage in this process, too. \xc2\xa0They obviously have concerns about engaging in this process at the negotiating table when, back home, they\xe2\x80\x99re seeing their fighters subjected to intense shelling and other violence, and they see that the territory that they hold is also the scene of innocent civilians being slaughtered. \xc2\xa0So their concerns about this process are entirely understandable, but everybody needs to come to the realization that we clearly have, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a military solution that can be imposed on Syria. \xc2\xa0We need to solve these political problems, and we need to get started on that -- or at least continue to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in the last few months so we can move this process along.</p>\n<p>\n\tRichard.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong. \xc2\xa0Did the President -- when the President talked about economic slowdown and stagnation outside of the U.S., he talked about headwinds. \xc2\xa0At what point does the strong dollar the weaker demand -- at what point will the White House be worried that it\xe2\x80\x99s going to affect the export and, by extension, the economy?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Let me start by saying there\xe2\x80\x99s not much I can say about the value of the dollar. \xc2\xa0The only government official that talks about that is the Treasury Secretary, and even he is cautious in making those kinds of pronouncements. \xc2\xa0We value the independence of the Fed in setting monetary policies. \xc2\xa0So I\xe2\x80\x99d be interested in what the Fed has to say about your questions, so you should go ask them.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat I can just say in general is something that the President\xe2\x80\x99s top economist, Jason Furman, has been observing for quite a while now, which is that the biggest risk to the U.S. economy right now is economic weakness and instability around the world. \xc2\xa0That we are encountering some headwinds in our economy because we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing other economies grow as quickly as we would like them to see. \xc2\xa0And so the question I think really for the United States is, what\xe2\x80\x99s our response to that going to be? \xc2\xa0And I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is there are there are a couple of things that we can do about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe first is, we can actually deepen our connections with those economies that are growing pretty robustly right now. \xc2\xa0And we do see that many of the economies that are included in the Trans-Pacific Partnership are economies that are quite dynamic. \xc2\xa0So let\xe2\x80\x99s deepen those connections and actually level the playing field, and give American businesses more of an opportunity to compete in that region of the world. \xc2\xa0That certainly is one way that we can start to compensate for some of the weakness and volatility that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in other markets. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s not the entire solution, but that surely should be part of it.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we can do is actually take a look at some of the ways that we can prepare the U.S. workforce to be even more competitive and even more productive. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why longer-term investments in things like job training and a college education, and in research and development, advanced manufacturing -- those kinds of investments have never been more important. \xc2\xa0That we can make -- that even in an economy where we are seeing other -- even in a global economy where many of our customers of American businesses are struggling, offering them better products and more advanced products and being even more competitive is a way to further solidify the position of the United States in the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that means making investments now that will pay a long-term benefit in a better-educated, better-skilled workforce and in certain sectors of the economy like technology and advanced manufacturing, where we can strengthen the kind of competitive advantage that we already enjoy, and that has led to the -- or at least contributed importantly to the kind of economic success that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in recovering from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I have a question on Syria. \xc2\xa0We talked about Aleppo, but we hear about different cities and populations being isolated and starving to death. \xc2\xa0You often underline the fact that the U.S. is the most important humanitarian donor. \xc2\xa0Is it an option to airdrop humanitarian aid to these populations or are we just giving this to refugees outside of the country and, in the end, abandoning the other ones inside?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0We talked about this a little bit yesterday, and let me say a couple things about it. \xc2\xa0The first is, the United States is the largest donor of bilateral assistance -- bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to Syrians fleeing violence. \xc2\xa0And that means making contributions to countries in the region that are already bearing a significant burden of caring for these refugees -- countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and others. \xc2\xa0The other thing that we have done is also provided significant resources to the aid organizations that are able to operate in Syria. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a very dangerous environment there. \xc2\xa0There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many that have the capacity to do that, but there are some, and we are seeking to support them by providing them resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very focused on doing is trying to negotiate ceasefires so that these aid organizations can operate safely on the ground to go and try to bring badly needed food and water and medical supplies to innocent civilians who are just caught in the crossfire. \xc2\xa0So there has been an aggressive diplomatic track to try to enact humanitarian ceasefires that would allow for some of this assistance to be provided.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen it comes to humanitarian airdrops, that is something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in isolated situations in the past. \xc2\xa0Yesterday, I cited the example of providing some humanitarian supplies to Yazidi religious minorities that had been isolated on Sinjar Mountain. \xc2\xa0What tends to be true of those kinds of humanitarian airdrops is, I think for obvious reasons, the amount of supplies that you can include in a humanitarian airdrop is pretty limited. \xc2\xa0It means that the longer-term impact of those supplies is limited, and the number of people that you can bring relief to is limited. \xc2\xa0But that was okay in the situation in Sinjar Mountain because we knew -- we had a good sense of the population of people that were up there, and it came on the heels of, or right around the same time as a coordinated military action to free them from that siege. \xc2\xa0So the humanitarian supplies just needed to get them through a couple of days until we could get them off the mountain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe kind of situation that we see inside of Syria right now is different than that. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about much larger populations of people, and typically we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people that have been isolated and under siege for a long time. \xc2\xa0So they have pretty grave needs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out humanitarian airdrops in the future, but our focus right now is on trying to get the kind of ceasefire that would allow aid organizations to provide that relief and that assistance on the ground. \xc2\xa0But you can move a lot more through a convoy of trucks than you can through pallets that are dropped out of a military transport aircraft.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- implying negotiating with the Assad regime.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it does. \xc2\xa0It does imply getting the Assad regime and the Russians to abide by a ceasefire agreement that would allow for the basic humanitarian needs of innocent people to be addressed, but also would advance the political negotiations. \xc2\xa0If we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to reach a political solution, let\xe2\x80\x99s stop the firing and try to broker our differences here. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s been part of our strategy, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve made a little progress in this regard, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more that we can do and we want to try to build on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far.</p>\n<p>\n\tMargaret.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, on Aleppo, you said a terrible humanitarian situation is poised to get worse. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99d also acknowledge that the loss of Aleppo would be a significant blow for the moderate rebels and those supported by the U.S.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, this is obviously one of the largest cities in Syria, and so it would be a setback to the opposition. \xc2\xa0But what we want to prevent is we want to prevent the kind of humanitarian disaster that could result from this situation, but we also want to try to prevent a further setback to the political process. \xc2\xa0That the more confident that the Assad regime gets in terms of their hold on power, the less of an incentive they have to even engage constructively in the political process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd, look, even the Russians -- this is something that President Putin said directly to President Obama. \xc2\xa0He acknowledged that a political transition inside of Syria was necessary to ultimately solve these problems. \xc2\xa0And given the significant investment that Russia has made in Syria, particularly when you consider their military installation, they have their own incentive to try to bring this violence to an end. \xc2\xa0And they recognize that they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a significant gamble by immersing themselves so deeply in the sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0But at some point, they just have to reconcile the contradictions that are inherent in their strategy.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in what you said about Saudi\xe2\x80\x99s offer, if it is that, about a ground force specifically. \xc2\xa0When you were saying you\xe2\x80\x99d welcome Saudi stepped-up aid, specifically ground forces, is that something that you -- the United States, supports?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The United States -- Secretary Carter made a request of a number of his counterparts who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition, including the Saudis, asking them to consider ways they could enhance and even increase their contributions to our counter-ISIL efforts. \xc2\xa0All those requests have included additional military support. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Secretary of Defense was making the ask.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But ground forces?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, in terms of what kind of commitment the Saudis have in mind, I would refer you to them. \xc2\xa0I can\'t speak for them about whether or not they were talking about a detachment of Saudi ground combat troops, or if they had in mind a commitment of Saudi special operations forces. \xc2\xa0They have a pretty advanced military in Saudi Arabia, and they have special operations forces that do have unique capabilities that could advance the goals of our counter-ISIL campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut in terms of the specifics, about what they\'re prepared to commit to this effort, you should check with them. I don\'t want to speak for them. \xc2\xa0But this will certainly be part of the discussion that Secretary Carter has with his counterparts in Brussels. \xc2\xa0And hopefully other countries will see the significant commitment that the United States has made. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll see this new commitment that the Saudis have made, and that they, too, will -- that other countries will also ramp up their commitment to this effort.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On Wall Street, I want to ask you, when the President was talking about softness in the global economy, looking forward, the jobless rate is a lagging indicator of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening and what will be happening. \xc2\xa0Wall Street is warning increasingly of a recession in 2016. \xc2\xa0Is the White House ruling that out?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the President\xe2\x80\x99s economists can give you a better assessment of this, and we can arrange for a conversation with you.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think in general what we would say is that we\'re mindful of the risks. \xc2\xa0The U.S. economy is not impervious to the weakness that we see in other economies that are closely intertwined in ours. \xc2\xa0The reaction of some people is to say, well, maybe we should sever those ties, or we should take a step back from the international economy. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s view is that the more that we can protect the ability of American businesses to do business overseas, the more customers they\'re going to have.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that means if we start to encounter some headwinds from China or some European economies, that creating additional opportunities in places like Vietnam and Singapore all of a sudden become pretty appealing. \xc2\xa0So that certainly needs to be a part of our strategy, and that\'s part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe other thing that we can do is invest in those areas where we already know that we have a competitive advantage, that investments in new technology and research and development -- even in the medical field, or advanced manufacturing -- these are all areas where the United States leads the world. \xc2\xa0We\'re at the cutting edge of these industries, and we know that these industries generate economic activity inside the United States. \xc2\xa0They also create good jobs. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure that we\'re investing in those industries. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s also make sure that we\'re investing in our workforce so that American workers are positioned to capitalize on those opportunities that are available.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did the President think that Democrats are also talking down the economy, something he said is not helpful, particularly the Democrats running for office who talk about some of the problems -- the lack of wage growth and long-term unemployment? \xc2\xa0Was he including them, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders in that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he was, primarily because I think what both of those candidates have said generally is that our economy has made a lot of important progress over the last seven years, and they want to try to build on it. \xc2\xa0And they said the same thing that the President just did, I think, in response to Michelle\xe2\x80\x99s question, which is that there\xe2\x80\x99s more work that we need to do here.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo the President is not suggesting that somehow we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to worry about the economy or that we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to take additional steps to support the private sector and to support the American workforce. \xc2\xa0What he\xe2\x80\x99s most concerned about is making sure that we capitalize on the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made as opposed to what the Republicans are advocating, which is actually taking us back to the policies that led to the Great Recession in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And, if you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge me, is the President keeping his Super Bowl picks for his conversation with my colleague Gayle King?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0She will be best positioned to try to draw that out of him. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much success that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have, but maybe Gayle considers that a challenge. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tCarol.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you have any more details on the larger speech on oil and energy the President said he was going to deliver?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t at this point. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s not anything like that that\xe2\x80\x99s on the books right now, but this is something that obviously has been on the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind and something that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking about. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you updated on when something like that comes together.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He just said that? \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think what the President was saying is that this is something he\xe2\x80\x99s been thinking about a lot, and does want to look for an opportunity where he can give a more fulsome response to the good question that Kevin asked.</p>\n<p>\n\tMary.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Back to Margaret\xe2\x80\x99s question about Democrats also commenting on the economy on the trail. \xc2\xa0I mean, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hammering against the economy pretty strongly. \xc2\xa0Hillary Clinton again last night said the economy has not been working for most Americans. \xc2\xa0Is she wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Again, I think -- I only watched part of the debate last night; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the whole thing. \xc2\xa0I think that there are parts of it that I did see. \xc2\xa0She went to great lengths to say that the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made over the last seven years has been important, has led to the kind of economy in the United States that makes our economy the envy of the world. \xc2\xa0It is, as the President said, the strongest and most durable economy in the world. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s thanks to some of the policies that the President put in place, but those policies were put in place to support American businesses and American workers that have led our economy recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the question is, are we going to keep in place those policies, further support American businesses and American workers and even look for opportunities to double down on those policies that have allowed us to make so much progress? \xc2\xa0Or are we actually going to take those policies away and take us back to an era that actually led to the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression?</p>\n<p>\n\tI feel confident in saying that both Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders would agree with that description of the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and their support for it, and how that stands in stark contrast to what\xe2\x80\x99s being advocated by Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And one question on immigration. \xc2\xa0In recent months, there have been several cases of local ICE officers moving forward on deportations that don\xe2\x80\x99t meet the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities -- a DACA recipient, for instance, being deported. \xc2\xa0Is the administration confident that DHS and its agencies are following the President\xe2\x80\x99s deportation policies?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I can\xe2\x80\x99t speak to any specific enforcement action from here. \xc2\xa0Obviously those enforcement actions are made -- or decisions about enforcement actions are made by law enforcement officers, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not something that we can or should or even try to dictate from the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat the Secretary of Homeland Security, though, can do is lay out in general some priorities for how he believes our limited law enforcement resources can be used to protect the American public. \xc2\xa0And the priorities that the President -- or that the Secretary has laid out are entirely consistent with the kinds of priorities that the President has in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut as it relates to specific cases, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to DHS. \xc2\xa0I just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to interfere with their law enforcement efforts. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tJordan.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Can you tell us more about the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senator Casey today, how that came about and what was specifically on the agenda?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot more about the meeting. \xc2\xa0The President -- I think one of the reasons the President may have been in a good mood today is that he saw that Senator Casey was on his schedule. \xc2\xa0The President got to know Senator Casey pretty well, not just when they served together in the Senate, but when they campaigned together in the state of Pennsylvania. \xc2\xa0And the President shows a lot of loyalty to Senator Casey, who stuck his neck out and took a significant political risk by endorsing then-Senator Obama in the 2008 presidential primary. \xc2\xa0That was at a time when President Obama was not at all leading in the polls in the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania, but yet Senator Casey stuck by the President\xe2\x80\x99s side and campaigned across that state for his campaign.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details to share with you about their conversation. \xc2\xa0But if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything else that we can share, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you know.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, now the Senator is a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton, so is the President going to return the favor?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99ll see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just one more on another meeting that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0It was reported that he met with Senator Grassley and Congressman Goodlatte on criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0Do you have any other details or readout from that conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of details from the specific conversation, but I can tell you what the President -- the message that the President delivered. \xc2\xa0We have been trying now for I guess more than a year at this point to nurture the bipartisan agreement on Capitol Hill about the benefits of criminal justice reform. \xc2\xa0If you enact criminal justice reform in the right way, you can accomplish a lot of goals that I think Democrats and Republicans share. \xc2\xa0You can make our criminal justice system more fair. \xc2\xa0You can actually save taxpayers costs in terms of the amount of money that we pay to lock up low-level drug offenders. \xc2\xa0You can also make our communities more safe. \xc2\xa0If you reform our criminal justice system in a smart way, you can actually reduce recidivism rates and reduce crime. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal that the President has in mind, and I think this is the goal that Senator Grassley and Chairman Goodlatte have in mind. \xc2\xa0And so that conversation primarily was geared toward trying to continue to nurture the bipartisan pursuit of this kind of legislation. \xc2\xa0As is consistent with any sort of bipartisan legislation, there is going to be some compromising involved. \xc2\xa0And it probably won\xe2\x80\x99t yield a perfect piece of legislation, but I do think we can produce a bill that moves in the direction of the priorities that I laid out. \xc2\xa0And the President wanted to have a conversation with Senator Grassley and Chairman Goodlatte to encourage them to continue to move in the direction. \xc2\xa0And frankly, these are the two individuals who have played such an instrumental role on Capitol Hill in making as much bipartisan progress as we have thus far. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I think the President also wanted to not just encourage them, but also to thank them for their hard work on this important issue. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s notable because we disagree on a whole bunch of other things with Senator Grassley and Chairman Goodlatte. \xc2\xa0But to their credit, they\xe2\x80\x99re taking to heart the responsibility that they have to not just try to find areas where they disagree with the President, but actually try to find areas where Democrats and Republicans might be able to agree and might be able to make progress for the country. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, and we hope they\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing it. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The Saudis are saying that they are ready and willing to send ground troops to fight ISIS, if asked. \xc2\xa0Whether those troops are infantry forces or whatever, or special ops, is it safe to say that you would welcome that as soon as possible? \xc2\xa0And is the U.S. going to ask for that?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we certainly have asked the Saudis for an increased contribution to our efforts, and I think this is a response to that specific ask. \xc2\xa0Those commitments will be discussed in greater detail by Secretary Carter with his counterparts in Brussels next week. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s sitting down with two dozen of his counterparts from nations who are part of our counter-ISIL coalition. \xc2\xa0And then the other thing that we have gone to great lengths to do is to make sure that the contributions that are made by different partners in our counter-ISIL coalition are integrated with the efforts of everybody else. \xc2\xa0And so that does mean that the Saudis can\xe2\x80\x99t just next week send in troops into Syria. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to make sure that their commitment is integrated into the overall effort, and integrated with the contributions that are made by other countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I don\'t envision a prolonged delay here. \xc2\xa0But we do want to make sure that our resources and the resources that are being committed by our partners are being leveraged to maximize the kind of outcome that we\xe2\x80\x99d like to see.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you say at this point that ISIS can\'t be defeated without ground troops?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think that we have acknowledged in the past a couple of things. \xc2\xa0One is that while we cannot impose a military solution on the problems in Syria and Iraq we can have a significant impact using some of our military strength; that the airstrikes, for example, that the United States and our coalition partners have carried out have resulted in ISIL fighters being taken off the battlefield, they\xe2\x80\x99ve resulted in ISIL leaders being taken off the battlefield, and they have enhanced the effectiveness of ground forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat we have said is that that ground component is critical to our military success; that airstrikes are important, but when backed up -- or when airstrikes are being used to back up ground operations, that kind of coordination is the best way to leverage our contributions to achieve our military goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Could you say if Saudi Arabia and the other Arab countries that it\xe2\x80\x99s talking about working with them on training and sending troops -- had they made this offer a year ago, or shortly thereafter, things would be much different in the ground than they are today?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to make that kind of assessment, because the thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve also said is -- at least this is particularly true when you\'re talking about Iraq, but it\xe2\x80\x99s true in Syria, as well -- ultimately, what we need is fighters on the ground who are fighting for their own country. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd obviously the Iraqi government -- the Iraq security forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government have much greater capacity to do that than opposition fighters in Syria for a whole host of reasons. But that\'s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve always said that ground campaigns inside of Iraq will be carried out by forces that are under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. \xc2\xa0The United States and our coalition partners will be there to support them in a variety of ways. \xc2\xa0We can provide them equipment; we can provide them some training; we can provide them some assistance and we can carry out airstrikes in support of their efforts on the ground. \xc2\xa0But ultimately, our strategy is predicated on Iraqis fighting on Iraqi soil for their country\xe2\x80\x99s security. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe need to see something similar inside of Syria. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s harder because we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not working with the Syrian central government. \xc2\xa0The Syrian government has lost legitimacy to lead. \xc2\xa0So what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeking to do is to build relationships with and support the efforts of opposition fighters on the ground. \xc2\xa0And, ostensibly, a greater commitment from Saudi Arabia would be integrated into that effort to support and enhance the performance of Syrian opposition fighters.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I ask this quickly only because today, Lisa Monaco did that op-ed, talking about the response to Zika. \xc2\xa0She contrasted it with Ebola, saying that really, with Zika, it\xe2\x80\x99s mainly transmitted through a mosquito bite. \xc2\xa0She talked about the differences. \xc2\xa0But on the same day, we see that scientists say that the active virus is detectable in both saliva and urine. \xc2\xa0So do you see that as potentially changing this game? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd with Ebola, part of the problem with how extreme the problem got was that there was kind of a slow response worldwide; like, the urgency wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there in the beginning. \xc2\xa0So if things are going to change based on where the virus is detectable, do you think that the urgency is there that should be now? \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not just talking about the U.S. response but the world response.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I do think that the world has learned from our experience with Ebola. \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a couple of things -- that taking aggressive action early is important. \xc2\xa0Building up the health care infrastructure in the countries where the disease is present is critical to our success. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe good news here is that the health care infrastructure in many of the countries in the Western Hemisphere where we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the virus is better than the kind of health care infrastructure that we saw in some of the countries in West Africa where the Ebola virus was present. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut one thing that is necessary about the Zika virus is we need to learn more about it. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s not been as much research in science performed on the Zika virus as there has been about Ebola. \xc2\xa0Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s a good reason for that, which is that Ebola is a terrible, fatal disease for just about everybody that contracts it. \xc2\xa0The risk from Zika is much, much different. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99ve done this before, but let me just reiterate quickly here.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I feel like I do. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it short. \xc2\xa0But look, the risks of Zika are different than Ebola. \xc2\xa0Most people who get Zika -- who contract the Zika virus don\xe2\x80\x99t show any symptoms at all. \xc2\xa0Those who do show symptoms have symptoms that last about a week, and they\xe2\x80\x99re things like a relatively low fever and some swelling.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe concern that we have with Zika is that it is potentially linked to a particular birth defect -- that when pregnant women contract Zika, there appears to be a correlation with their children being born with this birth defect. \xc2\xa0So that is what has attracted the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and that is what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to counter. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it materially different than the Ebola situation that we saw a couple years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\tSarah.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Yesterday when the President announced the oil fee, one of my colleagues on the climate beat tweeted \xe2\x80\x9cPOTUS is in climate #YOLO mode.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0And I ask about that because she was retweeted by the White House -- one of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s environmental strategists. \xc2\xa0And I know that RTs do not always equal endorsements, but is the President in \xe2\x80\x9cclimate #YOLO mode\xe2\x80\x9d? \xc2\xa0And to what extent is the budget proposal kind of a YOLO thing versus a really serious set of policy proposals?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think those two things aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily contradictory. \xc2\xa0I think that you can expect to see a budget that has some pretty bold, ambitious ideas included in it. \xc2\xa0And this is one of them. \xc2\xa0But the President is quite serious about them; that we often say that budgets are an opportunity to be quite specific about where your priorities lay. \xc2\xa0And that certainly will be included in the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget proposal.</p>\n<p>\n\tAgain, I think the Republican response also made clear what Republican priorities are. \xc2\xa0Based on the voracious response we saw to this, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that their priority lies with defending the oil industry. \xc2\xa0The President\xe2\x80\x99s priority lies with defending the middle class and trying to expand economic opportunity for the middle class. \xc2\xa0And that will be enshrined in the budget proposal that we\xe2\x80\x99ll roll out on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tGardiner.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I just want to follow up on Sarah\xe2\x80\x99s question. \xc2\xa0Help me understand sort of the political thinking here, because it does seem to me that your budget increasingly -- you are becoming increasingly disconnected with sort of legislative reality. \xc2\xa0And you were concerned in the past about making proposals that you felt had a chance on Capitol Hill. \xc2\xa0Now it seems that you are making proposals that you know have no chance. \xc2\xa0Is that because you simply want to lay out some markers for this party and this country about what should happen? \xc2\xa0Or is that sort of a political strategy to sort of put pressure on Republicans to oppose things that you think make sense? \xc2\xa0Or is it all of the above?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that\'s a good question, Gardiner, because there have been previous budget proposals where either I or one of my predecessors stood up here and said that our budget proposals reflected a genuine effort to compromise, and it factored in priorities that Republicans themselves had identified. \xc2\xa0But the fact is we often saw that Republicans turned up their nose at that. \xc2\xa0So I guess my point is that those kinds of budget proposals that we acknowledged on the front end were a genuine effort to compromise didn\'t result in great congressional action and it certainly didn\'t result in a more productive conversation with Republicans.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I do think that you can expect to see some pretty bold ideas. \xc2\xa0And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect Republicans to endorse every single component of those ideas, but there will be many things in there that Republicans should be able to support. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about the pretty ambitious agenda that we have for this year that is populated primarily by ideas that Republicans themselves say that they support. \xc2\xa0Criminal justice is certainly one of them. \xc2\xa0The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that we were talking about a little earlier is certainly one of them. \xc2\xa0There are ideas around the Earned Income Tax Credit and expanding it that Paul Ryan has spoken favorably of in the past. \xc2\xa0Frankly, I don\'t know if that proposal is included in the budget, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a chance to talk about that more on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the other things that\'s included in the budget that gets a lot of attention right now is this idea that Medicare should be able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices. \xc2\xa0There is at least one leading Republican presidential candidate who thinks that\'s a good idea. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that\xe2\x80\x99s included in our budget for at least the last couple of years, and it will be included this time. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting, as I mentioned earlier, that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to lay out a budget proposal that will be supported -- in which every line item will be supported by Republicans. \xc2\xa0But it is an opportunity for the President to make clear what his priorities are. \xc2\xa0And some of those are priorities that Republicans say they support. \xc2\xa0But, unfortunately, we see Republicans unwilling to even have a simple conversation with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director about them. \xc2\xa0And I think it certainly raises questions about how serious Republicans actually are about using their newfound majority in Congress to run the country. \xc2\xa0They seem to be using their majority in Congress to run campaigns. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s what voters intended when they elected their representatives into these positions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The President has said that he clearly wants to continue pushing on a lot of these priorities after his presidency. \xc2\xa0Is this budget in some ways, this transition from President Obama -- the beginning of that transition from President Obama to citizen Obama, where you are laying out some of these markers that he intends to continue pushing on, even after you\xe2\x80\x99ve run through the tape of this administration?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw the linkage that directly -- I think because, frankly, one of the benefits of being citizen Obama is that you\xe2\x80\x99re unconstrained by the kind of responsibilities that you had in your previous position. \xc2\xa0So, that said, the budget that we\xe2\x80\x99ll roll out next week will codify the highest priorities that the President has for the country and for the middle class. \xc2\xa0And I would certainly anticipate that when the President talks about public issues after he has left this office that he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to advocate for those kinds of priorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tGoyal.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks very much, Josh. \xc2\xa0I have two questions. \xc2\xa0One is, 18 months ago, as far as Prime Minister Modi\xe2\x80\x99s government in India is concerned, there was great bickering as far as personal relations with President Obama is concerned -- because President Obama was a special guest last year on January 26th. \xc2\xa0So much has happened under this new government in India, under Prime Minister Modi and President Obama, and now they have a hotline -- they can pick up the phone and call each other. \xc2\xa0So what is the future -- where is the future between the U.S. and India relations are concerned on many fronts? \xc2\xa0Which I believe Prime Minister Modi will be here next month for a nuclear security talk and all that.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I know that Prime Minister Modi was invited to participate in the National Security Summit. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he has announced that he is planning to attend. \xc2\xa0So his office could confirm that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\tLook, I think the best thing to point you to is the last opportunity that President Obama had to meet with Prime Minister Modi was in Paris, in the context of the climate talks. \xc2\xa0And there was a sense at the time that the Indian government might be the chief impediment to the successful completion of an ambitious climate agreement, and that ambitious climate agreement was completed less than two weeks after that meeting. \xc2\xa0I think that should be a pretty good indication to you that while obviously Prime Minister Modi takes very seriously the responsibility that he has to advocate for the citizens of his country, he can advance the interests of the people of India by working effectively with President Obama. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for our two countries. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for the citizens of our two countries. \xc2\xa0And I would expect the President will continue to look for ways to strengthen the relationship not just between the two leaders, but between our two countries during his final year in office.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Second, as far as immigration is concerned, according to a recent report, there are about 11 million undocumented immigrants here. \xc2\xa0But also the report said that there were some expert immigration lawyers that most of those who are here in this country, they are paying taxes and also they are contributing to the economy. \xc2\xa0So they are still relying on President Obama in this election year that there might be a light at the end of the dark tunnel and they think that President Obama is the only President who can bring light in their life. \xc2\xa0What do you think of the future?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that President Obama has been a leading advocate of immigration reform, the kind of common-sense immigration reform that would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows, that would require them to undergo a background check, to pay taxes. \xc2\xa0And we know this would have a positive impact not just on the lives of those immigrants, many of whom are American in every way but their papers, but it also would have a positive impact on our economy, because you obviously have a larger pool of people paying taxes, and it\xe2\x80\x99s harder for unscrupulous employers to try to take advantage of the undocumented status of some workers to pay them lower wages. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tSo we could put upward pressure on wages, and we can collect more taxes. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s good for the economy, it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country, and it certainly would make a difference in the lives of so many of these immigrants.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0As far as this campaign are concerned, what message do you think we are sending to these people that one Indian American Sikh with turban, he was asked to leave the rally because of his look -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t like your look and you have to leave my rally. \xc2\xa0And so President Obama has been recently speaking, including in Baltimore and also yesterday and all that this is not America, that we have original Founding Fathers -- that attack on one religion is attack on all the religions, among others, and he had a very clear message. \xc2\xa0So what do you think the message from the President to the Indian American community, especially the Sikhs, because of their look in turban?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, well, Goyal, I think you summarized it pretty well there, actually. \xc2\xa0I think the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments in Baltimore and yesterday at the prayer breakfast were a pretty clear indication that it is a core American value that people should not be targeted or marginalized or ridiculed because of the way they choose to worship God, and that right to do so, unimpeded by anybody -- let alone somebody who aspires to the highest political office in the United States, as a direct contradiction of a core American value. \xc2\xa0And the President I think spoke out quite forcefully about his commitment to defending that value for everybody.</p>\n<p>\n\tJohn, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, Kevin. \xc2\xa0John, you go, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do Kevin, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just so I\'m clear, had the White House actually sought a meeting between Republican leaders and the White House Budget Director? \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What typically happens, John, is that when the President puts forward his budget, the respective leaders of the Budget Committee in both the House and the Senate would invite the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director to come testify about the budget. And based on the research that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, that\xe2\x80\x99s happened every year for the last 16 years. \xc2\xa0Our assumption is that it goes back much longer than that, but we can continue to do that research. \xc2\xa0And even before the President put out his budget, the leaders of those committees, who happen to be Republicans, said that they were refusing to hold those hearings and were refusing to invite the Budget Director to even come talk to them. \xc2\xa0Again, that sounds to me like the Donald Trump approach to governing, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a lot of people are going to support it.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, did the administration treat this final budget you\xe2\x80\x99re proposing any differently given that it\xe2\x80\x99s his final year in office, Republicans control both the House and the Senate, it\xe2\x80\x99s an election year, and perhaps you want to, indeed, as you say, get things done in his final year?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Our goal in laying out this budget proposal was try to summarize the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities for the country and the priorities for the middle class. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s what will be included in the budget agreement. \xc2\xa0And I recognize that that means that not every element of the budget proposal will be supported by Republicans, but there should be plenty in here for Republicans to like. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so unfortunate that Republicans are not even willing to have a conversation about it with the President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Director.</p>\n<p>\n\tKevin, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do the week ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0Just a little bit of housekeeping on Gitmo. \xc2\xa0Any announcements to be made in the next week on other detainees being moved to other locations?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Nothing that I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared to preview from here. \xc2\xa0The Department of *Justice [Defense] does continue to work on the much-discussed plan that we\xe2\x80\x99ll present to Congress. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an updated timing for you on that, but I know that they\xe2\x80\x99re working on it even today, and that when that plan is presented to Congress we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure you all get a copy, as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Appreciate that. \xc2\xa0The national polls now seem to suggest that Senator Sanders and Senator Clinton, nationally, are almost neck and neck. \xc2\xa0Does this sort of debunk the idea among some Democrats that he\xe2\x80\x99s unelectable?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think one lesson that I certainly learned in the context of the 2008 race is that national polls can make for good fodder for a conversation around the water cooler, but what really matters for the strategy of these campaigns are the polls in individual states that are coming up. And these are state-by-state contests, and the smart campaigns are the campaigns that are not focused on the national polls but actually focused on the work that they need to do in the upcoming states.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo, again, the national polls can be the subject of an interesting discussion sometimes, but they\xe2\x80\x99re not particularly relevant to the strategies that are made by the smart campaigns, at least.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All right. \xc2\xa0And since the President won\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99ll give you your shot -- Super Bowl 50, who do you got? \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, that is a good question. \xc2\xa0I know that you have a vested rooting interest in the Broncos. \xc2\xa0But I think the truth is the Carolina Panthers had a great year and they\xe2\x80\x99ve only lost one game. \xc2\xa0So I think I would give a narrow edge to the Panthers. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see. \xc2\xa0Maybe the Broncos will pull it out and prove me wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\xe2\x80\x99re rooting for Peyton Manning to go out on top?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99s had a remarkable career. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is going to be his last game or not, but he\xe2\x80\x99s traditionally performed well when he\xe2\x80\x99s in the spotlight. \xc2\xa0So Carolina has got a great defense, but I think they can -- my expectation is that Peyton Manning will perform very well. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet\xe2\x80\x99s do the week ahead and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll let you get started on your weekend. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday, the President will host President Mattarella of Italy at the White House. \xc2\xa0Italy is a valued NATO ally and a close partner of a broad range of global challenges. \xc2\xa0During their meeting, the leaders will discuss our shared efforts to counter ISIL in the global refugee crisis. \xc2\xa0They will also exchange views on economic developments in Europe, the importance of concluding the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership and other issues of mutual interest.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, the President will attend meetings here at the White House. \xc2\xa0And that is, of course, the day that the budget will be released. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, nine years after he announced his candidacy for President, the President will travel to the place where his political career began by traveling to Springfield, Illinois. \xc2\xa0Now in the final year of his second term, the President looks forward to addressing the Illinois General Assembly about what we can do together to build a better politics, one that reflects our better selves.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the evening, the President will travel to the San Jose, California area where he will spend the night. \xc2\xa0On Thursday the President will attend a DSCC and a DNC event in the Bay Area. \xc2\xa0And later that day, the President will travel to the Los Angeles area to tape an appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\xe2\x80\x9d and attend a couple of other DNC events in the LA area, and then spend the night there. \xc2\xa0Thursday, will be a busy day.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Friday, the President will travel to Palm Springs, California, where he will spend the night. \xc2\xa0That is, of course, in advance of the ASEAN summit that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be hosting on Monday, February 15th, and Tuesday, February 16th.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe summit with leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations at Sunnylands, in Rancho Mirage, California, will continue important conversations about the Asia Pacific region. \xc2\xa0Following the conclusion of the summit on Tuesday, the President will return to Washington. \xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have some more information for you about the agenda at the ASEAN summit early next week I hope.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe one other scheduling matter that I\xe2\x80\x99ll let those of you -- I want to make sure that those of you who cover the White House closely are clued in on, as Margaret alluded to, both President Obama and the First Lady will be sitting down for conversation with Gayle King from CBS that will air during the Super Bowl pregame show. \xc2\xa0And then the President will also be sticking around for a taped conversation on Sunday that will air during the CBS early show on Monday morning --</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCBS This Morning\xe2\x80\x9d. \xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCBS This Morning.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Boy, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get some emails about that. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0So, as a regular view of \xe2\x80\x9cCBS This Morning,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to check it out. \xc2\xa0But anyway, that conversation will be taped on Sunday but will air first thing on Monday morning. \xc2\xa0So definitely tune in for that. \xc2\xa0Okay?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, are those fundraisers open or closed next week?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t know what the press access is for each event, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll delve into that and we\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll follow up with you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0Have a great weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:00 P.M.
