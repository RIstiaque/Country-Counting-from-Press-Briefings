EST<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I am going to go right into questions.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements at the top. So, Mr. Feller.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what to do.\xc2\xa0 I feel out of sorts here.</p>\n<p>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m not used to somebody being on time.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You don\'t have to air your personal -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics.\xc2\xa0 In Libya, the situation seems to have worsened over the weekend.\xc2\xa0 The rebels, as you know, are taking a terrible pounding from air strikes.\xc2\xa0 Is the potential for military intervention by the U.S. and NATO allies something that you think is growing?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you heard the President just make reference to the fact that we are meeting at the North Atlantic Council -- at NATO -- today, discussing options that NATO can take.\xc2\xa0 And those obviously include military options.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t characterize the likelihood of further options being pursued as greater now, but we have said from the beginning that those options were on the table and none of them have been removed from the table.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that there are a range of options that could be categorized as military including the substantial assistance that NATO could provide in the humanitarian realm, involving -- and I think that there was some focus on that in today\xe2\x80\x99s meeting at the NAC on the humanitarian aspect that can be brought to bear.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the deployment of ground troops something that\'s being considered?\xc2\xa0 Is that one of the military options?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say, Ben, that the -- no option has been removed from the table, but that ground troops is not sort of top of the list at this point. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One quick one on oil.\xc2\xa0 The chief of staff, when asked yesterday about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said that it\xe2\x80\x99s being considered, and he also made clear that it\xe2\x80\x99s only used in rare cases.\xc2\xa0 Can you explain the President\xe2\x80\x99s basic thinking about that?\xc2\xa0 What are the factors or conditions that would trigger a move like that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the chief of staff said yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s an option we are considering.\xc2\xa0 But there are a number of factors that go into it and it is not price-based alone.\xc2\xa0 There are -- it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at history about -- and the times when it has been used.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\'t look to a price threshold. The issue here is disruption, is there a major disruption in the flow of oil.\xc2\xa0 That\'s obviously a factor. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBut I think the point that we want to make is that we\'re very cognizant of the fact that Americans are experiencing a sharp rise in prices at the gas pump, and that affects them and their family budgets.\xc2\xa0 And we are monitoring that very closely.\xc2\xa0 Meanwhile, we are in discussions with oil-producing countries, as well as the IEA, about the various options that are available in the global system to deal with a major disruption, should that occur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill Daley\xe2\x80\x99s comments on television yesterday -- is that an indication that you\xe2\x80\x99re more actively considering the Strategic Petroleum Reserve?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t characterize it as more or less, simply that he was making the point that it is an option we are considering, and, again, within the broader context of the system that exists to deal with a major disruption, should that occur.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any kind of a shift.\xc2\xa0 And on Libya and the possibility of a no-fly zone, Britain came out today and said that they\xe2\x80\x99re involved in the Security Council in trying to come up with a Security Council resolution for a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Is the United -- I saw just as I was coming -- is the United States involved in that effort?\xc2\xa0 And also, does the President feel that he would need Security Council approval for establishing a no-fly zone, or would it be able to go ahead with just NATO?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are in consultation with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 A no-fly zone option is certainly one that would be discussed at NATO.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the procedures of getting there, should we want to pursue that option, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to elaborate on the paths, but only to say that it is being considered.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to -- as I think Mr. Daley got at yesterday on Meet the Press, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to be clear about what a no-fly zone is, what it entails in terms of enforcing it. And if you were to pursue that option you would want to make sure that it is addressing the need at hand and that it -- because there are only -- there are some things that a no-fly can do in terms of air traffic, and things that it can\xe2\x80\x99t do in terms of -- low-flying helicopter activity, for example, would be much harder to deal with in a no-fly zone.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think that what Secretary Gates got at last week, what Bill Daley got at yesterday was that this option is very much on the table, but people need to understand the complexities of it both in its implementation and what it can and can\xe2\x80\x99t achieve. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Security Council effort that he was referring to --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would just say that we are obviously in consultation with our international partners, and Great Britain would be one of them.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on that, is the United States working on draft language in the U.N. Security Council about a no-fly zone in Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything, Jake, on the process that I can tell you, except that it is a live option on the table that we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing with our partners.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this -- there are reports alluded to just a second ago --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I understand that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more than to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing that option as well as other options.\xc2\xa0 Another option that NATO would be very much involved in is enforcing the U.N.-mandated arms embargo, which is another thing that NATO would be involved in.\xc2\xa0 So, again, I just want to stress that the military options that we talk about are not limited to a no-fly zone, but include a no-fly zone as an option.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President and the administration send a message to those around Qaddafi, talking about how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be held accountability, they have to make a choice -- are there any specific individuals that they have in mind of individuals around Colonel Qaddafi?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly we know a number of the people around Colonel Qaddafi, and we are working to have a fuller list of people who can and will be held accountable for the actions that the regime is taking against its own people -- the brutalization of its own -- of Libya\xe2\x80\x99s own people.\xc2\xa0 And one of the points that I -- we have tried to make is we are using the full spectrum of our intelligence capabilities to assist us in identifying those who must be held accountable for the actions that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking.\xc2\xa0 And those who are around Colonel Qaddafi and making that existential choice about whether they want to be on the side of the Libyan people or on the side of a leader and a regime that no longer has any legitimacy, they should be fully aware of the fact that, broadly speaking, the world is watching what they do and they will be held accountable for their actions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just in terms of what has to happen for the U.S. to up the pressure even more on Colonel Qaddafi and those around him, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously several weeks into this -- he\xe2\x80\x99s shown no inclination that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to step down; he\xe2\x80\x99s shown in fact greater defiance than I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from others in that region who have -- such as Mubarak and others.\xc2\xa0 At what point -- with the U.N. reporting that more than a thousand people have died in Libya in these fights -- at what point does the U.S. say, okay, now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do something?\xc2\xa0 How many people have to die?\xc2\xa0 How many -- how much of a threat needs to -- does there need to be to our energy needs?\xc2\xa0 What needs to happen for the President to say, okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jake, I would simply say that and remind you that when you say that this has been a couple of weeks already, that is a remarkably short period of time from a point where Colonel Qaddafi was perceived to be and was in full control of his country to the point where the international community is imposing substantial and punishing sanctions on him and his regime.\xc2\xa0 And the international community, including in the Middle East, is speaking with one voice calling for him to step down and to cease the violence against his own people.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking here a matter of days and weeks that all of this has transpired.\xc2\xa0 We are monitoring the situation very closely, obviously, and aware of the ongoing violence.\xc2\xa0 And as the President just did with the Prime Minister of Australia, we call again on the Libyan regime, the Qaddafi regime, to stop the inhumane, brutal, unacceptable assault on its own people; and for Colonel Qaddafi to step aside because he has lost all legitimacy in the eyes of both his people and the world.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about it in terms of days so much as I was in terms of lives.\xc2\xa0 And as somebody who covered then-senator Obama on the campaign trail, who spoke with great eloquence about using U.S. force and the force of the international community -- not just words and not just sanctions -- but the force of the international community to stop slaughter.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- more than a thousand people have died, according to the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 How many more people have to die before the United States decides, okay, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take this one step of a no-fly zone, for example, or we\xe2\x80\x99re going to arm the rebels, for example?\xc2\xa0 What needs to happen?\xc2\xa0 How many more people have to die?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, Jake, it is understandable that as we watch the images that we are able to get about what -- that show us what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Libya, the urgency that we all feel to be able to move and do something quickly.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say the international community, with the United States in the lead, has moved with incredible rapidity to address the situation in Libya and continues to deal with this with great urgency. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe meeting today at NATO of the North Atlantic Council will be repeated daily this week as options are reviewed and considered.\xc2\xa0 But I, again, would urge some perspective on the speed with which we and our partners have moved in reaction to this situation in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And I think that comparative, when you talk about what the President said on the campaign trail, the comparative is instructive.\xc2\xa0 When you look at other events where international action has been required and how long it has taken, and compare it to the speed that was pursued in this case, I think we have moved rather quickly.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tYes, Jill.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you confirm these reports that the U.S. is asking Saudi Arabia to arm the rebels?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing for you on that, no.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, in connection with that, even if you can\xe2\x80\x99t -- actually, is there any other country that the U.S. might be asking to provide arms to the rebels?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 And, again, on the issue of arming, providing weapons, it is one of the range of options that is being considered.\xc2\xa0 But I think that we, again, are talking about a matter of days and weeks here since this situation began.\xc2\xa0 And when you talk about arming the rebels -- now, we have -- we are pursuing a number of channels to have conversations and discussions with the opposition groups and individuals as we try to learn more about what they are pursuing, what they want; and that they also believe what the -- we believe the Libyan people want, which is a government that is representative, that is responsive to the Libyan peoples\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate grievances and respects their rights.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think, again, speaking more generally, you have to be very cognizant of, when you pursue these options, what it is you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to accomplish.\xc2\xa0 And I think that it would be premature to send a bunch of weapons to a post office box in eastern Libya.\xc2\xa0 We need to not get ahead of ourselves in terms of the options we\xe2\x80\x99re pursuing.\xc2\xa0 And, again, I would refer you to the fact that we are reviewing and implementing actions with great haste.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one on the rebels.\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a disparate group, but has the U.S. had any -- let\xe2\x80\x99s see -- coalesced view of who they are?\xc2\xa0 Or is it still just a disparate group of people with very different motives?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would -- without getting into specifics about individuals or groups, we are using many channels -- diplomatic, the business community, NGOs -- to reach out to those in Libya who are working to bring about a government that respects the rights and aspirations of the Libyan people.\xc2\xa0 For a variety of reasons, I will not, from here, discuss how we\xe2\x80\x99re having those conversations or specifically with whom.\xc2\xa0 But we are, obviously, gathering information and learning about the opposition.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the no-fly zone, let me try -- you said ground troops are on the table but they\xe2\x80\x99re not at the top of the list.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I mentioned is that we have not removed any option from the table, and I would -- and I guess what I -- without -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- not to be over interpreted.\xc2\xa0 I simply would suggest that we are actively considering every option, and that the military aspects of humanitarian assistance are being actively discussed.\xc2\xa0 The no-fly zone is being actively discussed.\xc2\xa0 The enforcement of the arms embargo that the U.N. has mandated is being actively discussed.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not removing -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not removing any other options, but I would point that out.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said ground troops are not at the top of the list. Would it be accurate to say that no-fly zone is at the top of the list?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I just mentioned to you three areas that are being discussed today at NATO.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I pursue Jill\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit more?\xc2\xa0 Because there are actual -- there are reports overseas that Saudi Arabia has been asked by the United States to send weapons to the rebels.\xc2\xa0 Is that specific option on the table, asking Saudi Arabia to send them weapons?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the option of providing military assistance is on the table because no options have been removed from the table.\xc2\xa0 So I won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the means that that -- by which that would occur.\xc2\xa0 I would, however, point you to my comments in response to Jill\xe2\x80\x99s question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 CBS has been pursuing a story over the past week or so about gunrunning in Mexico -- hundreds and hundreds of guns going into Mexico, with the knowledge of ATF.\xc2\xa0 They had hoped it would lead them to the big fish, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xc2\xa0 And there are two developments on that today.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an IG investigation been ordered at Justice.\xc2\xa0 And Mexico has asked for whatever details the United States can provide on that.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any comment on the story and on these developments today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as the President pointed out when he spoke here with President Calder\xc3\xb3n, we take the issue of the flow of guns south very seriously, as we do the issue of the flow of drugs north.\xc2\xa0 And -- but beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he aware of the specific allegation that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- hundreds of guns went into Mexico with the knowledge of ATF?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Chip.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Final question, on the Strategic Political Reserve -- I mean, Petroleum Reserve -- is the price of gas a valid consideration in deciding whether to use that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say that the price of oil is one of a number of factors that is looked at -- that are looked at, rather, in making that determination, but not the sole factor.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a key factor, would that be fair to say?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'d just say it\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me take -- yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on the budget, regardless of the numbers that both sides choose -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s $100 billion or $61 billion or $6.5 billion -- you got to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re pretty far apart still.\xc2\xa0 And so the question is would you guys go for another short-term continuing resolution?\xc2\xa0 And also, with Biden gone to Europe, who\xe2\x80\x99s handling the negotiations?\xc2\xa0 Are there more meetings scheduled, phone calls?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are continued conversations at the staff level that have continued through the weekend and through today, and will continue as the Senate begins to take action on the bills that are on the table, which, I think will be an important milestone as we make progress in these negotiations. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would point out that depending on -- regardless of whatever number you want to start from, we have, beginning with the bill signed last December, which cut $41 billion from the President\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 budget proposal, and the baseline upon with House Republicans built their demand for $100 billion in cuts, we have now, both the administration and the Democrats in the Senate have met the Republicans more than halfway at $51 billion and change. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are engaged and will continue to engage in negotiations. We remain optimistic that there will not be a shutdown.\xc2\xa0 But we do not believe it would be -- we believe it would be bad for the economy, would have harmful effects if we did this sort of tollbooth where every few weeks we\xe2\x80\x99re reopening the questions of whether or not the government is going to be funded going forward.\xc2\xa0 I think the uncertainty that creates would be very harmful for the economy at a time when we are beginning to witness very positive signs that the recovery is gathering some steam.\xc2\xa0 We had a very positive jobs report number, as you know, on Friday.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we all agree that the last thing we should be doing in these negotiations is taking actions that reverse the trend of the recovery.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we remain optimistic that we can get a deal for a long-term resolution on the funding of the government with substantial spending cuts, which the President has made clear he supports.\xc2\xa0 If we find that common ground we can get that long-term resolution and move on to some of these other big issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if you have a short-term -- if you have to do short-term, two-week, you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, right?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- we remain optimistic that we can reach an agreement on the full year, fiscal year funding.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to draw a line here in the sand about what we will or won\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that it is unacceptable, it is not good for the economy and therefore a very bad idea to set up a scenario where we do this constantly every two weeks.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more question on Libya with the whole -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked -- you said, the President has said, that you want to send a message to people close to Qaddafi that they will be held accountable if the killing continues.\xc2\xa0 How do you measure whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re getting that message?\xc2\xa0 Are you -- is there anyone having direct contacts with some of these people?\xc2\xa0 How do you know that they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have a broad range of contacts, including with members of the Libyan government in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And then I would simply point you to what I said before about utilizing the full spectrum of our capabilities to make sure we are aware of the actions that are being taken by those around Colonel Qaddafi, and so that they can be held accountable by the international community.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wendell.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chief of Staff Daley said yesterday that a no-fly zone is not a video game.\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried that some people pushing for this are underestimating the potential cost in blood and treasure?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say simply that it is important to be very aware of the complexities of creating and enforcing a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 It remains very much on the table, but everyone involved in the discussions needs to be aware of what that means, both in terms of the logistics and the implementation that I think Secretary Gates talked about last week -- and also the cost.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s on the table, it\xe2\x80\x99s a serious option, but it is, literally, a serious option, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a simple one that you can simple say, oh, let\xe2\x80\x99s have a no-fly zone, snap your fingers and it happens.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it an act of war?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is part of the complexity the potential to rally Qaddafi supporters behind him?\xc2\xa0 Is there concern that U.S. military action could actually be counterproductive in that regard?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, setting aside specifically U.S. military action, we believe it is both true and very important to have it be perceived true that the unrest in Libya, the drive to force Colonel Qaddafi from power, and the unrest throughout the region is organic; it is not inspired by the United States or other Western or foreign countries.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an important factor here in the developments, the historic developments we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in these last weeks and months.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in order to not change that perception -- or would it possibly change that perception for the U.S. to be involved in some kind of military action?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.\xc2\xa0 But I think that we weigh, as we pursue the options we\xe2\x80\x99ve already enumerated and we weigh further options, obviously we want to be as aware as possible about the impact the pursuit of those options would have, both in the immediate effect -- we want to make sure they work in terms of our goal of ending the violence in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we want to make sure that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any negative ancillary pacts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Senator Kerry called for cratering Libya\xe2\x80\x99s runways.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lieberman has also pushed for a more aggressive U.S. response.\xc2\xa0 Are they contacting him privately?\xc2\xa0 Are lawmakers contacting the President privately to try and --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that for you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any private contacts between those lawmakers and the President.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that, again, we are actively considering the very options that those senators are discussing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who would -- I guess two questions.\xc2\xa0 First is who would hold Qaddafi loyalists accountable?\xc2\xa0 The U.S. or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The international community.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The international community?\xc2\xa0 And then to follow-up -- you listed some of the military options --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point out that the United Nations Security Council has referred this case already to the International Criminal Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And you mentioned or you listed some of the military options that are on the table, including ground troops, no-fly zone, military, humanitarian aide.\xc2\xa0 What others -- what other options are there besides those?\xc2\xa0 And arming rebels you also mentioned.\xc2\xa0 What other options are on the table militarily?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, we could speculate endlessly about the options.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that those are principal options that are being discussed, at least the three that I\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed:\xc2\xa0 humanitarian assistance, enforcing the U.N. arms embargo, and contingency planning for a potential no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Other options remain on the table, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list of them for you.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up on Chip\xe2\x80\x99s questions about this gun strategy that the ATF was running -- given the President\xe2\x80\x99s strong statements about the southward flow of weapons when the Mexican President was here, would he condone an ATF plan that uses -- in effect, uses guns as bait?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that except to point you to his statements about his concerns, our concerns about the flow of guns south.\xc2\xa0 But this -- for other questions about this story I would point you to the Department of Justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to confirm, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything because you weren\xe2\x80\x99t aware of this or --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to add to what I just said.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you take that question and perhaps be able to elaborate on it for us in terms of --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s something I can find out about it, I will.\xc2\xa0 But asking me a hypothetical about whether the President would or would not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hypothetical.\xc2\xa0 The program exists, or existed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll see what I can find out about it.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up on Athena\xe2\x80\x99s question on the CR talks.\xc2\xa0 You say you\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic, but Senator Durbin yesterday said that Democrats have been pushed to the limit in terms of the cuts that they\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to offer.\xc2\xa0 So where do you find compromise there?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, Juliana, that we need to see what happens when these proposals are voted on by the Senate, and we need to find a solution that can be passed out of Congress that this President can sign.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require the finding of common ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to require all sides to move off their positions -- as, I think, we have and the Democrats have.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s a process that is not at it\xe2\x80\x99s end; it is still sort of midstream here.\xc2\xa0 And I think we need to wait and see how the Senate responds when it votes on those two measures.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one other question.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the jobs report from Friday.\xc2\xa0 Unemployment is down but the administration is still calling on businesses to spend some of the $2 trillion in cash on hand that they have to help create jobs.\xc2\xa0 Businesses are saying that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to see -- a lot of that money is overseas, and so they\xe2\x80\x99re calling for a repatriation holiday.\xc2\xa0 Is that considered one of the loopholes that the President won\xe2\x80\x99t consider as part of corporate -- of grander corporate tax code overhaul?\xc2\xa0 Or is that something that the administration would support considering separately?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that a repatriation holiday would be something that we would consider as part of an overall process.\xc2\xa0 And I think as Secretary Geithner has said, the administration would not consider it outside of the context of broader corporate tax reform.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99ll point to his comments as the expert on this and leave it at that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a no-fly question and then a Peter King hearing question.\xc2\xa0 On the no-fly zone, Senator Kerry said this weekend that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t consider the implementation of a no-fly zone to be military intervention or an act of war.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Gates seemed to describe it just the opposite last week.\xc2\xa0 Where -- how should it be seen?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- as Secretary Gates pointed out, it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly military action.\xc2\xa0 The requirement, as he discussed, of taking some direct military action in order to effectively implement a no-fly zone is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the semantic debate here, but I think the point was to focus people\xe2\x80\x99s minds on what the option would entail in terms of its implementation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would taking out their air defenses be an act of war?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to what Secretary Gates said on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the hearings on Thursday, obviously Denis McDonough gave a speech to set the stage for this.\xc2\xa0 Should we expect anything more from the President or other administration officials before Thursday to put those hearings in the context that you want them?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I would say that the goal of the Deputy National Security Advisor\xe2\x80\x99s speech was not to put a context on the congressional hearings.\xc2\xa0 We welcome congressional interest in this issue.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s an important issue.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one we\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on for a long time.\xc2\xa0 It was addressed early last year in the national security strategy.\xc2\xa0 And Denis McDonough elucidated I think in great detail in his speech over the weekend what our position is on it.\xc2\xa0 So, again, he spoke to it at length.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty clear indicator of where we are on the issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we expect to hear from the President --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 So I would not expect --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nothing else?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing to announce on that, and I think that Denis\xe2\x80\x99s speech is a good place to go if you\xe2\x80\x99re curious about where we are on that issue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following up two on the front row, could I?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me get over here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll get to you, Lester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually, if I could follow up specifically on what Mara asked.\xc2\xa0 A number of Muslim groups think that the hearing themselves are singling out Muslims unfairly.\xc2\xa0 I gather you disagree with that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would just point you to the fact that we welcome congressional interest.\xc2\xa0 We also feel very strongly, as Mr. McDonough made clear in his speech, that we don\xe2\x80\x99t in the United States of America practice guilt by association.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, the Muslim American community -- we are all in this together as Americans, and Muslim Americans are part of the solution here -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not the problem.\xc2\xa0 And it is their assistance that helps us address it.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding our engagement with the communities to enhance our ability to deal with the issue of violent extremism in America.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, Congressman King thinks that the Muslim American community is not cooperating enough with the FBI -- that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons for the hearing.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just point you to the deputy national security advisor\xe2\x80\x99s speech on our view of that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you worried about creating false expectations among the Libyan people and setting them up for a slaughter?\xc2\xa0 This has happened in our history before, during the Hungarian Revolution, for example.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re being very careful about how we go about this process, as we look at and implement options and develop more options.\xc2\xa0 Again, I would say that the speed with which the international community has reacted has been quite historic.\xc2\xa0 But obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re very careful about how we pursue this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Lester.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 A U.S. Geological Survey report dated 2008 said that there were 3 to 4 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil assessed in North Dakota and Montana\xe2\x80\x99s Bakken formation.\xc2\xa0 And my first question, do you know of any report that this oil is being extracted so we will no longer have to depend so much on North Africa and the Middle East?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have nothing for you on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 A report three years later, this year, from the Energy Information Administration, estimates Bakken as the largest domestic oil discovery since Prudhoe Bay -- 530 billion barrels.\xc2\xa0 And could you tell us, how is the Obama administration encouraging or discouraging this oil production, since there are reports of $4 and $5 a gallon gasoline?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I would tell you, Lester, is that this administration has actively pursued the development of energy in the United States.\xc2\xa0 In fact, since the Deepwater Horizon spill, we have approved 37 permits for offshore oil drilling, and last week, as you know, approved the first deep water offshore oil permit since that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How about on the land?\xc2\xa0 How about in Montana?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Lester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 Maybe you should address that question to the Department of Interior.\xc2\xa0 But I would make the point that we are pursuing an energy policy that enhances our domestic production of oil but also looks broadly at all sources of energy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and that includes natural gas and nuclear, renewables.\xc2\xa0 It is a broad-based strategy aimed at reducing precisely the dependence that you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 As a matter of principle, does the President think it\xe2\x80\x99s important when gas prices go high that the government step in and intervene in the market process to protect American pocketbooks from that?\xc2\xa0 And separately, does he believe that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, should that be used as a tool to moderate price as opposed to just being a stockpile for future emergencies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you, Ann, to some of the answers I gave to related questions earlier.\xc2\xa0 First of all, we are very mindful of the fact that the rise in oil prices has caused a rise in gasoline prices, which has had a direct impact on family budgets around the country and we understand and are concerned by that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the broader issue of using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, there are a variety of options -- I mean, a variety of considerations that go into whether or not to take action in that regard.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an option that\'s on the table.\xc2\xa0 But remember, all the options that we consider here and the global system considers are aimed at dealing with a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 It is not simply a price-based consideration.\xc2\xa0 So I think that does answer your question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, my question is, why should the government intervene in a market economy --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about here is a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 And I would say that when we have unrest in the Middle East, that that is not a market issue.\xc2\xa0 It is -- it potentially could create a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that\'s happened, but that is the issue here.\xc2\xa0 It is not simply the market setting a price.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you seemed --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April.\xc2\xa0 Could I go to April, please?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 A couple questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk about AFRICOM\xe2\x80\x99s role as it relates to all the options that are still on the table when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with Libya -- what AFRICOM will play in a role if there is a no-fly zone?\xc2\xa0 What kind of role will AFRICOM play if boots are on the ground?\xc2\xa0 Could you talk to us about that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that those are \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d questions that are about what would happen if we did certain things that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t decided to do yet.\xc2\xa0 We are very heartened in general by the international consensus that has been created here very rapidly in condemning the actions of the Libyan regime and the brutalization of the Libyan people by the Libyan government, and that includes obviously AFRICOM.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have anything specifically about what role they would play in the implementation of options that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been selected.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the reason why I asked -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re saying they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cifs\xe2\x80\x9d -- but these \xe2\x80\x9cifs\xe2\x80\x9d are on the table, and that\'s the reason why it is in play and the reason why I asked.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I understand that.\xc2\xa0 But the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering options that may or may not be pursued doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for me then to enumerate how they would be implemented in detail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And when the President of Mexico, President Calder\xc3\xb3n, was here last week, did President Obama discuss with him an urgency about increasing the production of the sweet crude oil that we get from Mexico?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Correct me if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong.\xc2\xa0 Are you walking back a little bit from what the chief of staff said yesterday about --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 The chief of staff made clear that this is an option on the table, and it is an option that we\xe2\x80\x99re considering.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the reason I ask is there were -- a lot of people I talked to were surprised, quite frankly, it\xe2\x80\x99s being considered.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned looking historically when it\xe2\x80\x99s been tapped --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we talked about it late last week as something that -- when I was asked about this that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at various options and that the system, the global system has the capacity to deal with a major disruption.\xc2\xa0 So absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 And I think that there was a move to make a story out of something that really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a story.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s an option is as true today as it was on Friday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of a concern is it for the White House that this -- aside from the immediate political risk of high gas prices, how much of a concern is this might derail the larger economic recovery?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\'t think this is about politics.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about the impact on American families and their budgets.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s about the impact on the economy, which you\xe2\x80\x99ve just addressed, and then broadly, the global system of oil supply and the potential for disruption.\xc2\xa0 So all of those things are things that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at as we consider our options.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a question about -- President Obama about a week ago said that he agreed with Mitt Romney about the role that states would play in health care.\xc2\xa0 On the other hand, Romney moved to clarify his statement by saying that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional and that the federal government has a role in that.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama still agree, in light of this clarification that Mitt Romney attempted to make this past weekend?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think our point is that Massachusetts and other states that have tried to deal with this issue are examples of the very reason that the Affordable Care Act was necessary.\xc2\xa0 And as far as other statements that the former governor may have made about the plan he signed into law, I don\'t have anything for you on that.\xc2\xa0 But we believe very strongly that our health care system needed reform to produce -- to increase the access that Americans have to health care -- affordable health care, to deal with the skyrocketing costs, and to address the deficits that health care spending has added to.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you know, the Affordable Care Act, as analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, says that it will produce $200 billion in deficit savings over its first 10 years, and a trillion dollars in its second 10 years.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was the President\xe2\x80\x99s statement referring to the Massachusetts plan, saying that that was an example of what the federal plan intends to do?\xc2\xa0 It seems like that\'s not --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that it was a nod to the kind of recognition that states have had to deal with this issue, and that one of the reasons, as you know, going back last week, that the President announced the state innovation waivers and moving them up was precisely because he is interested in states -- if they have good ideas for how to achieve the goals set by the Affordable Care Act, that they pursue those -- and feels that it was -- that we could move that process up and achieve those goals even earlier than originally anticipated by the law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the impact of the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s trip on the budget negotiations.\xc2\xa0 It seems like an unfortunate timing for those talks.\xc2\xa0 In his absence, who is the administration point person, and is there any effort to keep the Vice President involved in conversations by phone and from Finland?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that, again, I would point you to my answer to Athena\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 The staff-level conversations are continuing.\xc2\xa0 The Congress, specifically the Senate, is taking up proposals by -- produced by the House on the one hand, the Senate Democrats on the other, and we all are waiting to see the outcome of those votes.\xc2\xa0 And then I would simply say that in the era of modern communications, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly possible that the Vice President could get on the phone with anyone here in Washington who needed to speak with him.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who on the staff is the point person while he\xe2\x80\x99s gone?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to specify, simply to say that a variety of staff members, senior staff members, have been in conversations with folks on the Hill about this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Was it a mistake for the last administration to resume diplomatic relations with Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re focused right now on the crisis that has unfolded in Libya in the last several weeks.\xc2\xa0 The fact that the Libyan government took actions to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction was obviously a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 But right now we are focused on the crisis at hand, and not the past.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it a mistake for this administration to keep those diplomatic relations going with the new administration\xe2\x80\x99s policies?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 And I would again focus you on the historic events that have occurred in the last several weeks, and explain that that\'s where our attention is right now.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did we get out of resuming diplomatic relations with Libya?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, the action taken by the Libyan government to deal with its weapons of mass destruction was obviously welcome.\xc2\xa0 It does not buy you a free pass forever and does certainly not make the actions that the same regime has taken in the last several weeks in any way acceptable or palatable.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\'d like to see if I could establish as fact something we all take for granted.\xc2\xa0 The President, Friday evening in Miami, said \xe2\x80\x9cWe\'re here because we want to win in NATO 2012.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 So is the President now an official candidate for reelection?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no election announcements to make from here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But how can he go out and say we want to win in 2012?\xc2\xa0 Is he an uncandidate, or what\xe2\x80\x99s the status?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I believe he was there at the event you\'re referring to, campaigning for Senator Nelson and Democrats in general.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a broad \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d there.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
