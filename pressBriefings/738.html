Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:47 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome to the White House.\xc2\xa0 Sorry I\'m late.\xc2\xa0 Had some meetings that ran long.\xc2\xa0 I do have something I want to say at the top.</p>\n<p>I wanted to provide a quick update on the ongoing engagement with the business community and the President, First Lady, and senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s team on a broad range of issues including the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda, immigration reform, cybersecurity, and issues important to our veterans and military families, to name a few.</p>\n<p>As you know, the President today will be dropping by two separate meetings with business leaders this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 The President will be attending a meeting with business leaders to discuss cybersecurity as a part of the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing dialogue with the private sector regarding this issue.\xc2\xa0 Attendees include David Cote from Honeywell International, Wes Bush from Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Randall Stephenson from AT&amp;T. A full list of attendees will be provided later this afternoon.</p>\n<p>After that, he will attend a meeting with business leaders where he will discuss our efforts on immigration reform and its role in our broader economic agenda.\xc2\xa0 Attendees of that meeting include Greg Brown from Motorola Solutions, Douglas Oberhelman from Caterpillar, and Virginia Rometty from IBM Corporation.\xc2\xa0 Again, a full list of the participants in that meeting will be provided afterwards.</p>\n<p>Finally, as part of the Joining Forces initiative, the First Lady delivered remarks earlier today at the quarterly meeting of member CEOs of the Business Roundtable, where she continued her call on the private sector to hire America\xe2\x80\x99s veterans and military spouses, and she also called on them to help reach their full potential within America\xe2\x80\x99s companies.\xc2\xa0 Mrs. Obama made the case that it has never been more important to join together and help our veterans and military spouses find employment and to build their careers, especially with more than 1 million veterans who will be hanging up their uniforms and transitioning back to civilian life in the coming years.</p>\n<p>Also this morning, senior staff, including Valerie Jarrett, Denis McDonough, Rob Nabors, met with members of the Business Roundtable executive committee to address a broad array of issues on the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.\xc2\xa0 And Treasury Secretary Jack Lew held a meeting yesterday with business leaders to discuss the President\xe2\x80\x99s economic agenda, including Jim McNerney from Boeing, and Fred Smith from FedEx.\xc2\xa0 I\'d refer you to Treasury for the full list of attendees.</p>\n<p>I do have one final note for the young among you in spirit or fact, and that is that Gene Sperling will be participating in an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I think you should check it out.\xc2\xa0 You will not regret it.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Awww.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll take your questions now.\xc2\xa0 Ask me anything. (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It sounds like yesterday the President was pushed during his meeting with Senate Democrats on chain CPI.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that the President and White House aides have said all along that he is going to support.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be in his budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I don\'t have details to give to you of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, as I think I\'ve said to Roger many times.\xc2\xa0 But I can tell you that the President\xe2\x80\x99s offer to Speaker Boehner, which includes among the entitlement reforms so-called chain CPI, remains on the table.\xc2\xa0 It is the President\xe2\x80\x99s position. It is one of the items that demonstrates the seriousness with which he approaches this challenge, the seriousness with which he believes -- the seriousness with which he approaches the necessity of bipartisan cooperation and his willingness to make tough choices in an effort to find common ground.</p>\n<p>Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to telegraph too much here because I will not get ahead of the presentation of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, which is a very detailed document, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s offer remains on the table.\xc2\xa0 And it would be wonderful if the Speaker of the House were to take it up and move forward with it because it does represent both the opportunity to achieve further balanced deficit reduction, to meet and exceed the $4 trillion deficit reduction goal, to set our economy on an even more fiscally sustainable path, and to invest in those areas of the economy that help us grow in the future that ensure that we have the information necessary to compete, to ensure that we have the workforce necessary to compete.\xc2\xa0 So again, the President believes that bipartisan cooperation is possible.</p>\n<p>He has put forward proposals that demonstrate his commitment to making tough choices, to meeting Republicans halfway in the arena of common ground and he certainly hopes that Republicans will similarly come forward with proposals that demonstrate that kind of spirit.</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- as you know, the President is meeting with House Republicans today, the House Republican Conference, and that\'s part of engagements he\xe2\x80\x99s having with lawmakers in an effort to talk about opportunities for bipartisan compromise on a whole range of issues -- budget issues but also immigration reform, measures to reduce gun violence, action that we can take to create more jobs and help our economy grow faster, invest in infrastructure and manufacturing.\xc2\xa0 These are the areas where there has traditionally been bipartisan cooperation and support and that he hopes there will be in the future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another topic, could you explain to me a contradiction between you and the President, and your statements on whether the White House made the call to cancel the tours?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nedra, the fact of the matter is that the White House runs the tours.\xc2\xa0 The tours are of the White House.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service staffs the tours.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service came to us with a decision that because of the sequester cuts, it would be, in their view, impossible to staff those tours; that they would have to withdraw staff from those tours in order to avoid more furloughs and overtime pay cuts.\xc2\xa0 It was our job then to cancel the tours.\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service cannot because those are White House tours.\xc2\xa0 So that is what the President was referring to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it sounds like he was wrong, though, when he said that the decision wasn\xe2\x80\x99t made by the White House.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the decision to cease providing Secret Service staff to the tours was made by the Secret Service.\xc2\xa0 They have their budget.\xc2\xa0 They look at it; they evaluate the options, all the bad options that are on the table, including, as they have said and we have said, tours versus furloughs and cutting of overtime pay, which goes to their core mission, and made the decision that their core mission was better served by canceling tours, which are very labor-intensive, than by having more furloughs and cutting more pay.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s a decision that we agree with, that we think is not a happy choice but is the right choice when it comes to the need for every agency affected by the sequester to focus on their core mission as they implement these cuts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But didn\'t the President say this not a decision --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, go ahead.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said this was not a decision made by the White House.\xc2\xa0 You just said it was.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I think I just answered that question and said that the Secret Service made the decision about its budget and to withdraw personnel from tours.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, and then you said it was --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We had to cancel the tours.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s our job to cancel the tours.\xc2\xa0 They cannot cancel them so -- because we run\xc2\xa0 -- this is not a tour of the Secret Service building.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a tour of the White House and the grounds.\xc2\xa0 And we run the tours and invitations and that process.\xc2\xa0 So the White House, as we have said, canceled the tours, confronted with the choice made by the Secret Service -- which we concur with, but it is certainly their choice because it\xe2\x80\x99s their budget -- that it was the right thing to do not to add further furloughs to the future for Secret Service agents, the men and women who put their lives on the line to protect senior officials in our government, and that the result would be cutbacks in staffing, hours in an area like tours, which is so labor-intensive.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to the fact that none of this was necessary.\xc2\xa0 These choices are all bad.\xc2\xa0 And that was the point of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the reason why we should be avoiding it.\xc2\xa0 And while it is an unhappy choice to cancel tours, on the one hand, or furlough the hardworking men and women who put their lives on the line in service of the country, our even greater concern is with the 750,000 Americans who will lose their jobs because of the choice to implement the sequester.\xc2\xa0 That is the worst outcome of the sequester.</p>\n<p>Another terrible outcome of the sequester is the reduction in economic growth that every economist on the outside who\xe2\x80\x99s analyzed this say will occur.\xc2\xa0 So I think we\'re now seeing that there are unhappy results of sequester.\xc2\xa0 It may be a home run in some folks\xe2\x80\x99 eyes, a victory for the tea party for some, but it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for America.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for those who will lose their jobs and those who suffer from diminished economic growth.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President indicated that White House tours are under review.\xc2\xa0 Last Thursday, Major asked you that question and you said no, they\xe2\x80\x99re not under review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The decision has been made to cancel the general tours.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in his interview, he\xe2\x80\x99s asked the White House to consult with the Secret Service to see if there\xe2\x80\x99s any way to provide limited tours to school groups or others.\xc2\xa0 That\'s being reviewed.\xc2\xa0 But I should be clear that the choices here -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not an option here to reopen the tours in general here, because, again, that\'s not an option because of the sequester cuts.\xc2\xa0 These are labor-intensive operations that require thousands of man-hours by the Secret Service, and the decision was made that given the unhappy set of choices sequester presented to the Secret Service, that this was the best option.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President said this morning that differences may be too wide to bridge the gap on reaching a grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a pretty pessimistic assessment.\xc2\xa0 Has he thrown in the towel?\xc2\xa0 And would he prefer simply to be given greater flexibility in how to administer the sequester cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\'re confusing two propositions here.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve addressed the flexibility issue.\xc2\xa0 There is no positive way to slice $85 billion out of the budget in six months.\xc2\xa0 We\'re now seeing that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not on the table.</p>\n<p>The second issue is whether or not we can achieve the grand bargain or the completion of the bigger deal that would achieve the $4 trillion-plus in deficit reduction that outside groups, as well as the President, the Speaker of the House and others have identified as the goal in deficit reduction over 10 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s true, as the President said, the divide may be too wide.\xc2\xa0 But it is also true that there is at least the potential for bipartisan compromise.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at it, both sides say they believe we should have additional savings from entitlement reforms, spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 Both sides say that we should reform our tax code in a manner that eliminates unnecessary loopholes and special breaks and incentives.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that that tax reform should generate revenue from the well-off and well-connected to contribute to the cause of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And if we do that and take the additional savings from the entitlement reforms that he\xe2\x80\x99s proposed, we can hit the mark and achieve that $4 trillion-plus in deficit reduction, in a way that helps our economy, allows it to grow, and does not unduly burden senior citizens or the middle class.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the Ryan budget, as we talked about and as the President said, presents the best argument for why balance is necessary, because if you don\'t choose balance, a balanced approach, you have to make the stark choices that that budget represents -- dramatic cuts in our investments in education, in manufacturing, in infrastructure, voucherization of our Medicare program, dramatic reductions in our Medicaid program.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>These are necessary choices if you\'re willing to ask the well-off and the well-connected, as the President has said we should and as the public has said we should, to contribute, to be part of the solution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President will have this discussion with House Republicans today.\xc2\xa0 He will also talk about a number of other issues.\xc2\xa0 He will continue those discussions when he meets with Senate Republicans and House Democrats, and he will continue these discussions in conversations and meetings, small and large, with lawmakers going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On cybersecurity, the National Security Advisor and I guess now also the President have mentioned China specifically in connection with cyber intrusions.\xc2\xa0 Would the United States accept China\xe2\x80\x99s offer to hold talks about cybersecurity?\xc2\xa0 And if there is any concrete evidence that the Chinese government is in any way behind any of the hacking attacks, what does the United States do?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I spoke about Mr. Donilon\xe2\x80\x99s speech, which was well covered and addressed this issue, among others.\xc2\xa0 And certainly the President has spoken about cybersecurity and made clear, as he has all along, that he sees it as an enormous priority, one that should have the attention of Congress and that Congress should act on through legislation that the President has supported but thus far has not made it out of Congress.</p>\n<p>He has taken action -- executive action to enhance our cybersecurity, but Congress needs to act.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the first.</p>\n<p>I would note -- you talk about the Chinese response, and we note that response from the Chinese foreign ministry and the foreign ministry said, \xe2\x80\x9cChina is willing on the basis of the principles of mutual respect and mutual trust to have constructive dialogue and cooperation on this issue.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 And we welcome that statement and look forward to engaging in a constructive dialogue on this issue.\xc2\xa0 That is one of the things that Tom Donilon talked about in his speech -- we need to have that conversation; we need to have that dialogue.\xc2\xa0 This is an international challenge and we look forward to that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to get back to the comment that the President made that the differences may be just too wide.\xc2\xa0 Should he talk to the Republicans in the House and the Senate before making that assessment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think you\'re -- isn\'t it a statement that is obvious?\xc2\xa0 As I have said, we\'re not saying that a deal is absolutely going to happen.\xc2\xa0 We\'re not trying to wish away the differences that exist.\xc2\xa0 We\'re trying to find common ground.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes there is common ground.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that we all have acknowledged that we need to reduce our deficit; we all believe that economic growth and job creation is a priority; and we all believe that the way forward in reducing our deficit should include entitlement reform savings and tax reform.\xc2\xa0 The open question is, in our minds, is what do you do with the savings from tax reform?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Speaker of the House identified, he said, up to a trillion dollars that you could gain just from the wealthy through tax reform, closing loopholes and exemptions.\xc2\xa0 That was just a few months ago.\xc2\xa0 He said that he would use that money to help pay down the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Now he says we won\'t use that money to help pay down the deficit.\xc2\xa0 But presumably, those loopholes exist and should be closed.\xc2\xa0 Those deductions can be capped and those exemptions should be eliminated.</p>\n<p>If that was his view then, I assume it\xe2\x80\x99s his view now.\xc2\xa0 The question is, Jim, what do you do with the money.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposition is that it is in the national interest and it is in the interest of fairness to the middle class and to senior citizens that they not be asked to bear the burden of further deficit reduction alone.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Spending cuts have been signed into law.\xc2\xa0 Further spending cuts can be found, and the President has put spending cuts on the table.\xc2\xa0 He has put savings from entitlements on the table.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no question here that he believes that more can be done on that side of the ledger.\xc2\xa0 But we need to do more on the revenue side, as well.</p>\n<p>I think President Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s chief economist has said in the last couple of days in an op-ed that he believes that we should have tax reform that generates more than $2 trillion in revenue towards deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 Well, the President admires the audacity of that proposal, but the President is asking for significantly less than that.\xc2\xa0 And maybe, in their veneration of Ronald Reagan, they will listen to that proposition and Republicans will say, we should do this and we can do this in the name of deficit reduction, which is allegedly or supposedly a top priority.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Speaking of deficit reduction, the President also said that there was not an immediate crisis in terms of debt.\xc2\xa0 But back in 2008, when the national debt was at $9 trillion, he called that irresponsible and unpatriotic.\xc2\xa0 The national debt has nearly doubled since then.\xc2\xa0 How is it not an immediate crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here is why this chart is here.\xc2\xa0 When the President came into office, we were in economic free fall.\xc2\xa0 We were heading towards the worst recession of our lifetimes, and we were on the precipice of a Great Depression, the likes of which we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since the 1930s.\xc2\xa0 The President took decisive action, working with Congress, to reverse the course of that downturn, to stabilize our economy and to set it back on the path of growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>Once that stabilization began to take hold, he turned towards the task of reducing our deficit, which he believes is also a worthy and necessary goal when it is part of the overall project, the overall number-one priority which is growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And you can see here what the effect is.\xc2\xa0 Because of the Great Recession when he took office, and because obviously of the measures necessary to be taken to avert a depression, here is what happened to deficits as a share of GDP in 2009.\xc2\xa0 Now, look at this drop:\xc2\xa0 2010, 2011, 2012, the projection for 2013, 2014 and forward, if the President\xe2\x80\x99s offer were enacted going forward.</p>\n<p>You have deficits that fall consistently well below the 3 percent target that economists have said is economically important, and you have the largest reduction in the deficit since the end of World War II, when we had massive demobilization in the wake of that war.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>This is progress.\xc2\xa0 Work needs to be done, but the President\xe2\x80\x99s point is we do not have an immediate debt crisis.\xc2\xa0 We are on the right trajectory.\xc2\xa0 We need to make decisions that affect the long term, and the long term not just in terms of deficit reduction, but in terms of economic growth.</p>\n<p>And if we make those choices now -- and that includes investments in infrastructure, investments in education, investments in manufacturing and innovation -- we will be growing faster, we will be stronger economically.\xc2\xa0 And that contributes\xc2\xa0 -- as the veteran reporters from the 1990s here know, growth contributes to deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 That\'s part of the package.\xc2\xa0 It is much harder to reduce your deficit and deal with your debt if you\xe2\x80\x99re not growing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that only happens if you get a deal, if you get some kind of deal.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is if -- first of all, this has happened, and this will happen.\xc2\xa0 And that is the largest reduction in the deficit since the end of World War II.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the offer would be a deal of some sort.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The fact is that the further projections are if the President\xe2\x80\x99s compromise solution were adopted.\xc2\xa0 I think if a compromise solution of any sort that represented the principles the President has put forward and bipartisan commissions have put forward -- a balance that includes revenues and reductions -- that you would have a similar positive impact on our deficits and debt.\xc2\xa0 And that would be tremendous for our economy.\xc2\xa0 It would be fantastic for our middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s the goal here.</p>\n<p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the bigger goal of growth and jobs.\xc2\xa0 It is not, as the President has said, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve said less articulately, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a goal unto itself.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the bigger project here of growing the economy and strengthening the middle class.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Karl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of those groups that have been having bake sales and raising money for their trip to Washington, the President referred to, was the St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Lutheran School in Waverly, Iowa.\xc2\xa0 Their tour was scheduled for Saturday.\xc2\xa0 Will you be able to provide a tour for the St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s School?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have seen that report, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very unfortunate, as is the case with all those who have seen their tours canceled because of the implementation of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the Secret Service and the White House are talking about what is possible.\xc2\xa0 I would not anticipate that opening tours that soon would be possible.\xc2\xa0 But again, I don\'t want to prejudge the outcome of this, but I also want to set expectations here.</p>\n<p>There is a stark reality that has come about because of the imposition of the sequester, the home run, the tea party victory, and that is that these cuts are being implemented across agencies and across the country.\xc2\xa0 And the effects are real, and they result in job loss or furloughs or pay cuts, and closures of tours in this case, because those are the options that are available.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is no way to guild the lily here.\xc2\xa0 This is a bad situation that results in bad choices because the policy was designed to present bad choices and bad choices only, which is why Congress was supposed to avoid it and to come up with an alternative means of achieving the deficit reduction that is otherwise achieved through arbitrary, across-the-board cuts.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Secret Service told us that the tours cost $74,000 a week.\xc2\xa0 How much is it going to cost for the President to travel later this week to Illinois?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is the President of the United States, and he is elected to represent all of the people. And he travels around the country, appropriately.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a figure on the cost of presidential travel.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously something, as every President deals with because of security and staff, a significant undertaking.\xc2\xa0 But the President has to travel around the country.\xc2\xa0 He has to travel around the world.\xc2\xa0 That is part of his job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much does it cost for him to go and play golf?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jon, again, you\xe2\x80\x99re trivializing an impact here. People will lose their jobs.\xc2\xa0 Three-quarters of a million people will lose their job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about choices.\xc2\xa0 You have a certain amount of --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 The law stipulates what the costs will be for each agency.\xc2\xa0 Those jobs will be lost, okay?\xc2\xa0 And you can report on White House tours, or you can find out what the impacts are out in the real world -- additional impacts are.\xc2\xa0 This is a real-world impact here, and it is unfortunate.\xc2\xa0 And it is an unhappy choice.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is Congress made this choice -- Republicans made this choice.\xc2\xa0 Their option was to do what they did a few months ago and delay the sequester to allow for time to try to negotiate a bigger deal.\xc2\xa0 They chose not to because they refused to accept the principle that the well-off and well-connected ought to pay a little bit towards deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 That was a choice.\xc2\xa0 And it was a choice that was presented to the American people as a home run, as something that was politically advantageous, in the back pocket of the Speaker of the House; it was a tea party victory.\xc2\xa0 But there are consequences to that victory for the tea party, and the consequences are what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been discussing today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When the President says there is no deficit crisis --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He didn\'t say that, actually.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- no immediate deficit crisis, and he said none for 10 years, how do you expect to get a grand bargain?\xc2\xa0 How do you expect to get both sides to make those difficult choices if there\'s no crisis?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there is a long-term debt challenge.\xc2\xa0 Everybody recognizes this.\xc2\xa0 The President speaks frequently that our long-term deficit and debt are driven primarily by health care costs, the expense of administering programs like Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.\xc2\xa0 That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s put on the table, actually, more detailed entitlement reforms than the Speaker did, for example, on the fiscal cliff deal.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he has already implemented savings out of our entitlement program, savings that of course Chairman Ryan and others railed against but then adopted in their own budget proposals.</p>\n<p>So this is a challenge.\xc2\xa0 But what we should not do is take action that does harm to our economy, does harm to our middle class, does harm to our seniors and only does well by the well-off and well-connected in order to address a deficit challenge that can be addressed appropriately in a balanced way that grows the economy, helps the middle class, and protects our seniors.\xc2\xa0 This is a pretty clear choice.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President is heartened by the fact that there are not just Democrats and independents who support the balanced approach to deficit reduction, but Republicans and Republican lawmakers who have expressed it and who have an interest in finding common ground.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why he\'s having these conversations on this issue and many others.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Briefly concluding the tour conversation, are the weekend staff tours, are those also --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All tours are canceled.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Even for the staff members of the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, there\'s no weekend staff tours.\xc2\xa0 Staff are able to give tours, but those are all canceled, correct.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to ask a question that was sort of alluded to\xc2\xa0 -- you spoke to in brief yesterday.\xc2\xa0 But obviously, this is day two of this sort of shuttle diplomacy, this charm offensive as some have described it right now.\xc2\xa0 Is this, as one White House anonymous individual described it, this is a joke done for the media\'s benefit, mind you -- is this a legitimate, genuine effort as some Republicans have questioned?\xc2\xa0 Or is this --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know Kristen was here yesterday.\xc2\xa0 Let me make clear -- I have no idea who said that to the writer of that article.\xc2\xa0 But that thought, that opinion does not represent the President\'s views.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent the White House\'s views.\xc2\xa0 It does not represent the administration\'s views.\xc2\xa0 The President is absolutely committed to engaging with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He has enjoyed his engagement so far.\xc2\xa0 He believes it has been productive and constructive, and has led to positive conversations both with Senate Republicans and House Republicans, and that includes his lunch with Chairman Ryan last week.\xc2\xa0 So I could not be more categorical in making clear, I believe, that that remark does not represent the views of this White House or this President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So given the fact that he has now had that dinner with some Republican senators and that conversation over lunch with Chairman Ryan as well as Representative Van Hollen here, now we\'re several days into this and just yesterday, Chairman Ryan put out a budget that a senior administration official referred to as draconian and a "gimmick."\xc2\xa0 So how is it going?\xc2\xa0 Is this working, this so-called charm offensive?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re not going to shy away from our policy differences any more than Chairman Ryan has shied away from his policy differences with us.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that Chairman Ryan is sincere in the expression of his priorities that are demonstrated in his budget priorities -- in his budget proposal.\xc2\xa0 But he also believes that it was a constructive conversation; I believe Chairman Ryan has said that.\xc2\xa0 And he also believes that we can and should move forward to see if we can find common ground on this -- the general proposition that we can move together and take action to reduce our deficit in what the President believes should be a balanced way.</p>\n<p>And let\'s just dial back to what the President said in his inaugural address.\xc2\xa0 The American people do not expect us to resolve all of our differences.\xc2\xa0 They do expect us to come together and work together to meet the challenges that face us.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that on matters of budget policy and fiscal policy, social policy, and other kinds of policy there are and there will be stark differences between the two parties, leaders of the parties.\xc2\xa0 And that is true today and it will be true four years from now.</p>\n<p>But there is remarkable consensus on some issues, on identifying a problem that should be solved -- deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We forget that now everybody takes for granted the idea that both sides agree with this notion that we should reduce our deficit by at least $4 trillion over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 That\'s a consensus opinion.\xc2\xa0 People forget that it\'s noteworthy that Republicans and Democrats alike believe that we ought to deal with our long-term entitlement challenges, that we ought to reduce spending in a smart way, and that we ought to reduce the size of our deficits as a portion of GDP.\xc2\xa0 That\'s significant.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And people forget, too, that when you talk about the differences that if Republicans are firmly in the camp of no new revenues and Democrats are supposedly firmly in the camp of no spending cuts, this President -- this Democratic President -- has signed into law with Democratic support more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction, more than four to one, four dollars to one dollar in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 That represents compromise.\xc2\xa0 That represents middle-of-the-road consensus, positive action for the economy and for the country.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>You seemed a little --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I defer.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Did you hear that everybody?\xc2\xa0 Major Garrett defers.\xc2\xa0 Are you deferring tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 This is a very chivalrous group.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On cybersecurity, could you talk a little bit more about what it is the President is either going to impart to the CEOs or wants to hear from the CEOs?\xc2\xa0 And is there a reason in particular that the contents of that conversation in either direction requires them to be in the Sit Room?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 I know it sounds super cool.\xc2\xa0 But as those of you who are familiar with the West Wing, it is an amazingly small space, and when the Roosevelt Room is occupied with a meeting -- as is the case at the same time -- the options are few for a meeting of any size that would exceed, say, my office.</p>\n<p>So the Situation Room is being utilized -- as it is frequently -- for that kind of meeting.\xc2\xa0 It\'s not related to the --\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s not related to the subject.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not related to the subject, no.\xc2\xa0 And we have meetings there on occasion on different topics that are not related to national security issues or classified matters.</p>\n<p>And then on your first question, the President has obviously had discussions with business leaders on the cybersecurity issue. He has seen, as various corporations and business leaders have gone public with their concerns about cybersecurity and the effects of breaches of cybersecurity on their operations, and that is why he wants to have this conversation and why he thinks this is an important part of building a consensus about moving forward, about why it\'s necessary for our economy and for our national security.</p>\n<p>The sharing of information and working with private -- with the private sector on this issue is vitally important in the comprehensive approach the President believes we need to take to deal with it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is this more of the President wanting to communicate his concerns to them and employ them in the lobbying effort on Capitol Hill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s a two-way.\xc2\xa0 He wants to hear from out in the field what they\'re -- in the private sector -- what they\'re experiencing, what their concerns are, what their challenges are, what they hope to see in terms of action in Washington.\xc2\xa0 And he also wants to convey to them how seriously he takes this issue and what he believes the right steps are moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And he certainly hopes that out of this meeting and the many others he has on this topic, that we will build the kind of consensus necessary to compel Congress to take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 You said earlier that Republicans consider this a home run.\xc2\xa0 You called it a tea party victory.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Those are quotes from the fine work of the fourth estate.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, I know.\xc2\xa0 I\'m assuming you were quoting Republicans, right.\xc2\xa0 But the recent polls have shown that the President\'s job approval, especially on the economy, has taken a hit as the gridlock and the sequester has gone forward.\xc2\xa0 It seems like he owns the economy no matter -- and dysfunction in Washington no matter what you\'ve tried to do.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering whether you think your efforts to explain to the country that it\'s the Republicans fault have fallen short.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 First of all, as I say repeatedly and as we experience together, communally, be careful of making too much of any individual poll --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a series of them.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- or even a series of polls.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I would also say, if we refer to the latest, the Washington Post or ABC News poll, that the President at 50-percent job approval is about where he was when he won reelection overwhelmingly with 332 electoral votes.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just a layman in making that observation, but I think it\'s true.</p>\n<p>It is a remarkable fact about how low the public\'s estimation of Republicans has sunk that the news of that poll was that the President was at 50 percent -- not that the Republican Party had a disapproval rating in the mid-seventies.\xc2\xa0 But let me say, having made those observations -- simply to urge you not to focus too much them -- is that we\'re about the business of trying to get stuff done for the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We understand when Washington is dysfunctional -- as Washington was dysfunctional when Republicans made the decision to allow the sequester to be implemented -- that the American people look at that and say, enough already.\xc2\xa0 They want positive action.\xc2\xa0 They want bipartisan cooperation.\xc2\xa0 And when Washington is dysfunctional, everybody in Washington looks bad.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we -- I would note, in that poll, as long as we\'re talking about it, that the change in view that Americans have developed in -- as it regards to the sequester, now that it has been implemented and the cuts are being felt -- I think frustrations with the result of congressional inaction are growing.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s just another reason why we need to come together and have the kind of discussions that hopefully can lead to a bipartisan compromise on deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up on Jon\'s question about the President\'s own budget.\xc2\xa0 Other briefers have said that every -- the sequester means that every single program from top to bottom has to be cut by the same percentage.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is for nondefense -- like 9 percent or something.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s 9 percent and 13 percent for Defense, roughly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does that mean that the President\'s budget -- personal staff, household budget?\xc2\xa0 Or were those exempted -- I mean, in terms of how it affects his golf trips and his --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I believe the Executive Office of the President was affected just like every agency within the executive branch.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we\'ve referred these questions to OMB for the details, and they have been providing information about how the sequester is affecting the White House and White House staff.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the problem you\'re going to be faced with every day is to show that the President himself is taking a hit, his own activities are being curtailed by the same percentage as all those other people who are getting furloughed.\xc2\xa0 And my question is, are they?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you work here.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do, and everyone here works, obviously, in service of the President, and the fact is, his staff is going to be affected by the sequester.\xc2\xa0 So the President will be affected, there\'s no question, as the sequester takes effect and as the impacts of the sequester are felt in terms of pay reductions or furloughs or the like.\xc2\xa0 And I think we\'ve provided information as it\'s become available about what those impacts will be on the executive branch.</p>\n<p>Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Does the President still think that American involvement and American mediation is necessary for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\xc2\xa0 And why does he see the need to stress to the groups he met that he\'s not taking any new peace plan to the region?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think he\'s stressing a matter of fact; it\'s not a need.\xc2\xa0 He\'s simply saying that he\'s going to the region, going to Israel and Jordan and the West Bank, to have conversations with leaders that he\'s meeting with, and also with -- in Israel, to engage with young people in Israel about the future of the Israeli-U.S. relationship.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And when it comes to the Middle East peace process, our fundamental position has been that the two sides need to come together in face-to-face negotiations to resolve the differences between them and to achieve the two-state solution that is the goal of both sides, as well as the United States and our international partners.\xc2\xa0 So that is why we are critical of unilateral steps by either side that we believe do not serve the cause of returning to face-to-face negotiations, and it is why we encourage both sides to return to face-to-face negotiations.</p>\n<p>In the end, peace has to be reached in negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians -- not imposed by any outside party.\xc2\xa0 Now, the United States historically and in this administration has been engaged in that process, in trying to facilitate that process, and we remain very much engaged in that process.\xc2\xa0 But we believe the steps need to be taken to bring the two parties back to negotiations, and that\'s what the President I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will stress when he talks about this.\xc2\xa0 But he doesn\'t have a new proposal, and I think that\'s the point he was making.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one more question.\xc2\xa0 Does he intend to visit Syrian refugees while in Jordan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a background briefing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any more details for it -- about it today.</p>\n<p>Let me go to Mike, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to go back to the chart there and the goal that the President has set.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the past, particularly around the time of the convention, the President had praised the balanced budgets and even surpluses that had been generated during the Clinton administration with a Republican Congress.\xc2\xa0 Now he\xe2\x80\x99s setting the goal not at a balance or a surplus, but at 3 percent of GDP.\xc2\xa0 Why is that not a contradiction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because -- you were around, right?\xc2\xa0 You remember the recession in 1991?\xc2\xa0 Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it have been wonderful for the country if the recession of 2007, 2008, and 2009 were anything like as shallow as that recession?\xc2\xa0 The country was faced with catastrophic economic decline, a global financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 The President inherited deficits from the previous administration that dwarfed the size of deficits that were inherited by the incoming President in 1993, which is not to suggest that the task that President Clinton met and the success he enjoyed working with Congress in eliminating those deficits was not significant, but the size of the problem was unprecedented that this President faced when he took office in January of 2009.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s just review the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2008, prior to him taking office, the United States economy shrank by almost 9 percent -- 9 percent.\xc2\xa0 It is estimated that the United States lost $16 trillion of wealth -- that\'s the size of the debt -- $16 trillion of wealth because of the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0 Those figures are enormous, and the country faced enormous challenges as a result of the financial crisis.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And because of the grit and determination of the American people, because of their ingenuity, because of the focus that was applied by the President, members of Congress, business leaders and others, we have reversed that course.\xc2\xa0 We have been on a period of sustained growth and sustained job creation for three years -- over $6.3 trillion -- sorry -- 6.3 million private-sector jobs created in three months.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think the answer to your question is the size of the problem was exponentially larger, but the goal of reducing our deficit is worthwhile within the context of the bigger goal of economic growth and job creation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you just about one other thing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You just announced Deborah Jones has been picked as the Ambassador to Libya.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us a little bit about why the President chose her?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate the question.\xc2\xa0 The President has announced today his nomination of Deborah K. Jones to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Libya and to represent the American people during this important stage of Libya\xe2\x80\x99s new democracy.</p>\n<p>We are pleased also to welcome Libyan Prime Minister Zeidan to Washington for his first official visit.\xc2\xa0 The Prime Minister is meeting with Secretary Kerry today at the State Department and will also be at the White House for meetings with senior administration officials.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I can tell you that Ambassador-to-be Jones is a career Foreign Service officer who has served admirably in diplomatic posts around the world.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:30 P.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
