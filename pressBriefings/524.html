Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p class="p2">12:12 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good early afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 Before I take your questions, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to mention something.</p>\n<p class="p3">As many of you are well aware, with over 5 million people now signed up for private health insurance plans through the marketplaces, and 13 days left to enroll this week, we are doing a March Madness enrollment push to reach our fellow college basketball fans, especially young adults, before the March 31st deadline.</p>\n<p class="p3">Yesterday, we released our \xe2\x80\x9c16 Sweetest Reasons to Get Covered\xe2\x80\x9d bracket, and a video by the UNC and UCONN coaches.\xc2\xa0 Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to have NCAA and NBA champion Shane Battier joining us to release a new analysis by HHS that looks at the economic costs and the incidence of common sports injuries like sprains and fractures.\xc2\xa0 The report finds that almost 2 million people every year suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatments in emergency departments.\xc2\xa0 And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have insurance, these types of injuries can really set you back financially.\xc2\xa0 For example, treatment for a sprained ankle could cost over $2,000.\xc2\xa0 Treatment for a broken arm could run you as much as nearly $7,700.\xc2\xa0 This data also finds that the rate of these types of injuries is especially high among folks under 25.</p>\n<p class="p3">So this is yet another reminder of the importance of getting covered, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re an athlete, a fan, or, like so many of you here, both.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Take that as a compliment.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Ukraine -- Putin annexed Crimea today.\xc2\xa0 What is the definition of success if this is being labeled a test of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, as Tom Donilon mentioned over the weekend?\xc2\xa0 What is failure?\xc2\xa0 What is success?\xc2\xa0 Before, you were trying to stop something from happening; it seems that now you have to undo something.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a much tougher task.\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s the goal for the meeting of the G7 in The Hague next week?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me say a few things.\xc2\xa0 We condemn Russia\xe2\x80\x99s moves to formally annex the Crimean region of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 Such action is a threat to international peace and security, and it is against international law.\xc2\xa0 We would not recognize this attempted annexation.</p>\n<p class="p3">As we have said, there are costs for such action.\xc2\xa0 Along with our partners in Europe and Japan, the United States imposed sanctions yesterday, including an executive order that gives us an expansive tool to sanction Russian government officials, entities operating in the arms sector in Russia, and individuals who act on behalf of or provide material support to senior officials of the Russian government.\xc2\xa0 You have seen some designations already, and there are more to come.</p>\n<p class="p3">We also continue to be focused on how we can best support Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 We urge Congress to pass legislation as soon as possible that will enable us to provide Ukraine the resources it needs.\xc2\xa0 We also support the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing work to negotiate a package with the Ukrainians.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">In addition, as you know, Vice President Biden was in Poland today, and he will be in Lithuania tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 To our NATO allies, our message is clear:\xc2\xa0 We have a solemn commitment to our collective defense, and we will uphold this commitment.</p>\n<p class="p3">Lastly, I would note that today, President Obama invited his counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the EU to a meeting of G7 leaders next week on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague.\xc2\xa0 In answer to your question, the meeting will focus on the situation in Ukraine and further steps that the G7 may take to respond to developments and to support Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the U.S. and the other members of the G7 have already suspended our preparations for the G8 Summit in Sochi.</p>\n<p class="p3">The actions that Russia has taken, in clear violation of international law, in clear disregard for Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity and Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty, have not been and will not be recognized by the international community.\xc2\xa0 Those actions have incurred costs already.\xc2\xa0 They have done damage to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy, to its currency, and to its standing in the world.\xc2\xa0 Further actions, further provocations will lead to higher costs.</p>\n<p class="p3">The goal of our policy is to make clear that in the 21st century, in the year 2014, these kinds of actions are not tolerated by the international community; that they are responded to, they bring about consequences.\xc2\xa0 And the leaders of Russia will have to make their own calculations about the costs that they are incurring for their country and for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s future and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the world.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">In the meantime, the President is focused on working to build and sustain the consensus that exists in opposition to these actions, and to ensure that we collectively, both here in the United States and in Europe and Asia, are working to support Ukraine and to make it clear that these kinds of actions will not be accepted by the international community.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the goal of the policy is for the Russians to disavow any steps that they have taken for the Crimean Peninsula to become -- to be part of Ukraine?\xc2\xa0 Or is it more to just get the Russians to stop threatening the Eastern Ukrainian region?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The answer is both, in the sense that what Russia has done -- the referendum held under circumstances that are unacceptable under international law and in violation of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s constitution, the military actions taken by Russia, the actions taken by the Crimean parliament and the Russian Duma are not and will not be recognized by the international community.\xc2\xa0 Further provocations will result in increased costs to Russia and others who engage in activities that violate a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone after visas, asset forfeitures.\xc2\xa0 None of that has changed Putin\xe2\x80\x99s mind.\xc2\xa0 Why not deploy the full arsenal of your economic power against them initially, instead of doing it piecemeal, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be doing anything with the Russians?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jim, what I would say is that the motivations and the calculations of the leaders in Russia are for them to describe.\xc2\xa0 What we have done is made clear that these actions will never be recognized by the international community.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re illegal, and they violate a sovereign state\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We will make clear that we support the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people.\xc2\xa0 And we will make sure that there are costs to Russia for the actions that Russia has taken.\xc2\xa0 And the assessments as to what costs Russia\xe2\x80\x99s leaders are willing to pay on behalf of their nation and at the expense of the Russian people are ones that they will have to make.\xc2\xa0 But they are real.</p>\n<p class="p3">And Russia is taking action that reverses some of the work that that nation had done to establish itself as a responsible leader on the international stage.\xc2\xa0 It isolates Russia.\xc2\xa0 It undermines faith in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to rule of law, and therefore undermines the incentive that global investors might have in investing in Russia.\xc2\xa0 That effect has a negative impact on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economy and on the Russian people.\xc2\xa0 And those costs are real.</p>\n<p class="p3">What we can do is make sure that the costs are imposed, that the international community speaks with one voice in opposition to these steps, and that we together take action to ensure that the costs are imposed as we take action to ensure that Ukraine is supported with assistance by the United States and our allies and partners and the IMF, and as we take steps to make it clear, as Vice President Biden has done in Poland and will do in Lithuania, that we consider our commitment to our NATO allies a solemn commitment that, of course, will be upheld.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on another subject -- The Washington Post is now reporting that the NSA has the ability to not only collect metadata about phone calls made and numbers, but that the calls themselves are recorded and can be played back.\xc2\xa0 These are calls from foreign countries.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the report, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to it except to say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t, as a general rule, comment on every specific allegation or report.\xc2\xa0 We made clear what activity the NSA and our intelligence community engages in, and the fact that they are bound by our laws and the oversight of three branches of government.\xc2\xa0 We also note, as I did the other day, the steps that the President announced in January to significantly reform our activity in order to provide the American people even greater assurance about these programs. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific on that report.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, would the U.S. back the expulsion of Russia from the G8?\xc2\xa0 Do you expect this to come up at the meeting next week?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We and the other G7 nations have already now announced that preparations for the planned G8 Summit in Sochi have been halted.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a preview of all the topics that will be discussed in the G7 meeting in The Hague, on the fringes of the National Security Summit -- sorry, the Nuclear Security Summit.\xc2\xa0 But certainly Ukraine and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s behavior will be the number-one focus of that conversation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">It is hard to imagine a meeting of this group taking place in Russia under the current circumstances.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Vladimir Putin said today that he\xe2\x80\x99s not interested in Ukraine beyond Crimea.\xc2\xa0 Has he given the President such assurances, and do you believe him?</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, spoke with President Putin the other day, one of several conversations, lengthy conversations the two leaders have had.\xc2\xa0 We provided a readout; I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more specificity on that conversation.</p>\n<p class="p3">What we are monitoring is activity, of course, in Eastern Ukraine and near Eastern Ukraine, and we are making clear that further provocations will be met with further costs to Russia. \xc2\xa0We are making clear our support for the Ukrainian government.\xc2\xa0 We are working with Congress to ensure that bilateral assistance is provided and that the IMF has all the tools it needs to provide even greater assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re in conversations with the Ukrainian government and others about other modes of assistance that we can provide.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge the truthfulness of the statements.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to look and see and evaluate the actions that are taken.</p>\n<p class="p2">Let me go up and back.\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Russian stock market is soaring the last couple days.\xc2\xa0 Is this a sign that the sanctions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken are ineffective if they\xe2\x80\x99re not really paying a cost?\xc2\xa0 In reality, it\xe2\x80\x99s up about 8, 9 percent in the last couple days, their main stock exchange.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s down for the year and I think the ruble has lost value.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the long-term effect of actions taken by the Russian government, in clear violation of the United Nations charter, in clear violation of its treaty commitments that are destabilizing and illegal, will have an impact on their economy all by themselves.\xc2\xa0 They will also incur costs because of the sanctions that we and the EU have imposed, and there will be more actions taken under the authorities that exist with the two executive orders that the President has signed.\xc2\xa0 So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if I were you, invest in Russian equities right now -- unless you\xe2\x80\x99re going short.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is it for Congress to act, given this last few days?\xc2\xa0 And is the administration considering additional steps that you would like to see Congress take when they return in the light of the fact that the annexation is now going forward?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Additional steps that Congress can take or should take?\xc2\xa0 What Congress needs to do, as soon as it is able, is pass the assistance package that has been moving through the Senate.\xc2\xa0 And we strongly encourage both houses to pass legislation that not only provides the bilateral assistance but ensures that the IMF has all the tools necessary to provide the maximum amount of assistance to Ukraine -- because our bilateral assistance, everyone agrees, is meant to complement, not replace, the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.\xc2\xa0 And if we all care, as we say we do, about making sure that the Ukrainian government in this difficult moment has all the assistance it needs to stabilize its economy, Congress needs to make sure that those IMF quota reforms are passed, as well as the bilateral assistance.</p>\n<p class="p2">What other steps Congress can take, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we will be in discussion with congressional leaders about that matter.\xc2\xa0 We are in regular consultation with the Ukrainian government, with our allies in Europe and others about what the Ukrainian government\xe2\x80\x99s needs are and how we can assist them.\xc2\xa0 Right now, our focus is and continues to be on de-escalation and on doing what we can to help Ukraine stabilize their economy in this difficult moment.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jim.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 After that performance in Moscow today, does the President believe that Putin would actually give Crimea back?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re not judging motives or intentions or predicting future actions, Jim.\xc2\xa0 I think President Putin spoke for himself today, and everyone can evaluate what he said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">What is unquestionably true is that the actions that have occurred in Crimea, the decisions made by the Russian government are all in violation of international law and the Ukrainian constitution.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We have said all along, and so has the Ukrainian government, that there are legal means by which the residents of Crimea could take steps to change their status within Ukraine or change their relationship with Ukraine or Russia, for that matter.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s a legal code in place and a constitution in place for those kinds of discussions to take place and decisions to be made.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it appears that Putin is not adhering to that legal code.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No question.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So how do you deal with a person like that?\xc2\xa0 How do you deal with the Russians if they\xe2\x80\x99re not abiding by the same legal code?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are imposing costs to Russia through sanctions and other measures.\xc2\xa0 The international community is doing the same, and there are other costs incurred by Russia because of these actions that have an effect on Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ability to grow and prosper in the future.\xc2\xa0 So what the motives of the Russian leadership are, I have to point you to statements by Russian leaders.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is there a sense of urgency that the West needs to step it up quickly in order to have Putin and Russia reverse course?\xc2\xa0 Is there a sense of urgency?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is certainly a serious situation and we have taken steps accordingly, and we will continue to do so as I indicated earlier.\xc2\xa0 There are more designations to come when it comes to specific sanctions under the authorities created by the executive orders.\xc2\xa0 And I noted that the executive order the President signed yesterday is an expansive tool that allows for sanctions to be imposed on Russian government officials -- that has happened -- but also on entities operating in the arms sector in Russia and on individuals who act on behalf of or provide material support to Russian government officials even though they themselves do not hold office in the government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">And I think that we discussed that yesterday -- there are individuals who fall into that category who have both a great deal of influence in Russia and on the Russian government and who also have substantial assets that can and would be affected by these kinds of sanctions.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard the critics in the last couple of days say that because the President showed weakness to Russia, that that invited this move from Putin to take Crimea.\xc2\xa0 What is your best argument that that is not the case?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I would say in response to those criticisms, which always lack an alternative approach or proposal.\xc2\xa0 The idea that bombing another country -- in this case, Syria -- would have somehow been the right policy in order to send a message to the leader of Russia so that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t take action against Ukraine is preposterous in many ways.\xc2\xa0 It is also provably wrong, as others have said.<span class="s1"> </span>The fact that President George W. Bush invaded Iraq and had two ongoing wars in the Middle East didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to affect Russia\xe2\x80\x99s calculations when it came to its actions in Georgia.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem with the logic.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">I would generally say that when assessments are made and judgments made about the course of action the United States is taking with regard to Ukraine, most of what we here called for, we are doing and we will continue to do, including stepping up our assistance to Ukraine, including ratcheting up the costs to Russia for their actions.\xc2\xa0 If there are other concrete ideas that lawmakers or others have, they ought to express them; and certainly if they\xe2\x80\x99re good ideas, we may take them up.</p>\n<p class="p2">Chuck.\xc2\xa0 I never get to my right here.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What made today so special about suspending diplomatic relations with Syria?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it\xe2\x80\x99s about -- what\xe2\x80\x99s special about today --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t it happen sooner?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Following the announcement that the Syrian embassy suspended its provision of consular services, and in consideration of the atrocities the Assad regime has committed against the Syrian people, we have determined it is unacceptable for individuals appointed by that regime to conduct diplomatic or consular operations here in the United States.\xc2\xa0 Consequently, the United States notified the Syrian government today that it must immediately suspend operations of its embassy in Washington, D.C. and its honorary consulates in Troy, Michigan and Houston, Texas. Syrian diplomats at the embassy and Syrian honorary consulates are no longer permitted to perform diplomatic or consular functions, and those who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents must depart the United States.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out is why didn\xe2\x80\x99t this happen nine months ago when I think the Assad regime --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As I said, following the announcement that the Syrian embassy suspended its provision of consular services and in consideration of the atrocities perpetrated by the Assad regime, this step was taken.\xc2\xa0 I think the suspension of consular services was the nearer-term precipitating event.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s more of the tipping point.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador McFaul said today -- said this morning in response to Putin\xe2\x80\x99s speech that there should be more -- that the President should be enacting more sanctions today, that our new response should take place today.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think I said that --</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Vice President Biden seemed to hint that more is coming.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, more is coming.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have timing for you.\xc2\xa0 But work is being done to make further designations.\xc2\xa0 And obviously when --</p>\n<p class="p6">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It will continue to be on the individual?</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to itemize what\xe2\x80\x99s under consideration or what the decisions will be.\xc2\xa0 The authorities under the two executive orders are broad and give us the tools we need to take appropriate action as we see fit, given the decisions by the Russian government.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can you give us more on the Merkel phone call?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President spoke with Chancellor Merkel not that along ago, today, about Ukraine, about the collaboration that the two leaders have engaged in with our shared allies and others to ensure that the actions in Ukraine, in Crimea, the transgressions by the Russian government are not viewed as legitimate by the international community.\xc2\xa0 And that effort is clear to see, and it was evidenced by the 13 to 1 vote --</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She agreed with that?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speak for Chancellor Merkel, but I would point you to her public statements, which have been quite clear and strong on this matter, and on the need for further steps to be taken in response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to get a response to Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s op-ed today that seemed to suggest that the President takes too -- that he\xe2\x80\x99s left with bad options because he takes too long to make decisions in certain situations, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s Syria or Russia, on foreign policy.\xc2\xa0 I just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if you had a response to --</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you want -- anything to say in response to his --</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll resist.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p7">All the way in the back.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two questions on the missing flight.\xc2\xa0 First, Malaysia is criticized of lacking cooperation with the FBI.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House frustrated with that?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to repeat.\xc2\xa0 You said, Malaysia is criticizing?</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of lacking cooperation with the FBI.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Criticized for.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For -- yes.</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the Malaysian government has the lead in this investigation.\xc2\xa0 U.S. officials are in Kuala Lumpur, as you know, working closely with the Malaysian government on the investigation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p7">This is a difficult and unusual situation, and we are working hard, in close collaboration with the Malaysian government and other partners, to investigate a number of possible scenarios for what happened to the flight.\xc2\xa0 Our hearts of course go out to the families of the passengers.\xc2\xa0 They are in a truly agonizing situation.</p>\n<p class="p7">We remain fully committed to assisting the Malaysians and working with our other international partners on this investigation, on this effort.\xc2\xa0 And we are providing assistance through the NTSB, through the FAA and through the FBI.\xc2\xa0 So I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the report that you\xe2\x80\x99re mentioning.\xc2\xa0 I can assure you that we are in a close, collaborative relationship as regards this investigation.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And also, there are some new reports saying that the missing flight could have landed in the U.S. military base, Diego Garcia, in the central of Indian Ocean.\xc2\xa0 Do you rule in that or rule out that?</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll rule that one out.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p7">Bill.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned earlier that there will be costs.\xc2\xa0 Again, you said that yesterday, you said it today.\xc2\xa0 But a lot of people who have looked at the sanctions that were imposed yesterday have found them to be minimal, and in some cases risible.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Rogozin said that they were written by a prankster.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, a lot of the people who were sanctioned don\xe2\x80\x99t have any assets in the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So --</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Or say they don\xe2\x80\x99t.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Or say they don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 So how do these bite?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what --</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, what I can tell you is that the actions taken against 11 individuals were part of a process that will continue because of continued unwillingness by Russia to resolve this in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with international law.\xc2\xa0 And the costs have been real and they will increase.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into a guessing game about what the decision-making process is among President Putin and his advisors about steps moving forward or the acceptability of the rising costs that are being imposed on Russia for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions.</p>\n<p class="p7">What I can tell you is those costs are real and they will increase.</p>\n<p class="p7">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What are those costs?\xc2\xa0 I mean, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any indication from you what you think the costs are.</p>\n<p class="p7">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, that\xe2\x80\x99s -- because somebody pops off for a television camera doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the costs aren\xe2\x80\x99t real; that blocking of assets -- access to assets, blocking of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ability to travel are not real consequences.\xc2\xa0 And as outlined in the two executive orders that the President signed, there are authorities in those orders to expand considerably the sanctions imposed in response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to reverse course in this matter.\xc2\xa0 And so the costs will increase.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p8">And as we just discussed with regard to one of the provisions, one of the descriptions of those who could be sanctioned under yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s executive order, they include individuals who are influential with, close to, and provide material support to leading government officials but are not members of the government.\xc2\xa0 I think anyone who understands how the Russian system of governance works and who has influence in that system understands the kind of person that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here, and the fact that they have substantial assets not just in Russia but abroad.</p>\n<p class="p8">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Exactly to that point:\xc2\xa0 People have pointed out that the people who were sanctioned yesterday are not the top-level oligarchs of Russia.\xc2\xa0 They are people who have some influence --</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t disagree with that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what your point is.\xc2\xa0 We took steps yesterday identifying 11 people.\xc2\xa0 Further steps will be taken, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear today, in response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s continued refusal to avail itself of the means to resolve this diplomatically in a dialogue with the Ukrainian government, with the participation of international interlocutors, through the presence of U.N. and OSCE monitors in Ukraine; through a process that is established under Ukrainian law and the constitution that would allow for the legal discussion of decisions, like changing the status of a region within the sovereign state of Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 These are all options available to Russia, available to those in Crimea who have taken this step.\xc2\xa0 Russia has not availed itself of those options, thus there will be further costs imposed not just by the United States but by others.</p>\n<p class="p8">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t really expect the Russians to walk back what they did this morning, do you?</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to psychoanalyze motivations or behavior, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict actions.\xc2\xa0 What I can say is that we have been very clear that there are costs to this behavior; those costs have been imposed and are increasing as the behavior continues.</p>\n<p class="p8">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they just don\xe2\x80\x99t look very severe.</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Bill, I get your point.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s yours to have.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing and what our policy is.</p>\n<p class="p8">Ed.</p>\n<p class="p8">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I ask you about health care?\xc2\xa0 You started out by saying 5 million people have enrolled.\xc2\xa0 Is that the correct word, \xe2\x80\x9cenrolled,\xe2\x80\x9d since we still don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many people have actually paid their premiums?\xc2\xa0 Is it 5 million signed up?\xc2\xa0 Will we get the information on who has actually enrolled and paid their premiums?</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 CMS is working to provide more detailed data on who has already paid their premiums, what percentage of the population of enrollees that includes.\xc2\xa0 We can point you to major insurers who have placed that figure at 80 percent, give or take, depending on the insurer.\xc2\xa0 But we don\xe2\x80\x99t have specific data that is in a reliable enough form to provide.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with how these things tend to work.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p8">And what is ironic to me, I think it was -- in some ways it seems like yesterday and in some ways it seems like five years ago instead of five months ago -- but I doubt, based on the questions I got in the room at the time, that anybody would have done anything but laugh if I had said there would be 5 million enrollees by March 18th.</p>\n<p class="p8">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last time Secretary Sebelius did a call with CMS officials a couple weeks ago with enrollment figures, they did say -- as you say -- they\xe2\x80\x99re working on the data; they hope to have that data soon about who\xe2\x80\x99s paid.\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate it would be by the end of March?</p>\n<p class="p8">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to CMS.\xc2\xa0 I understand what\xe2\x80\x99s happening here, which is the battle to discredit the process has been lost on the grounds of -- in the arena of nobody is going to enroll, healthcare.gov is a disaster, the whole thing is going to collapse of its own weight.\xc2\xa0 Well, that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, and I apologize to those who were hoping it would.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p8">But, you know, what we are doing is systematically implementing a law that provides enormous benefits to millions of Americans who are making clear that they want us to do that by the demand they\xe2\x80\x99re showing.\xc2\xa0 Every time there\xe2\x80\x99s an issue that needs to be resolved, we are going about the business of resolving it.\xc2\xa0 Every time there\xe2\x80\x99s data that we are able to provide in a responsible way, we provide it.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the case here.</p>\n<p class="p3">What I can tell you is a lot of people have signed up; a lot more will sign up.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re signing up because they want the benefits provided by the options available to them, and I am confident that no matter what the number is on April 1st, there will be those who find it insufficient.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 One reason people have to go to the exchanges to get covered is if they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a new job.\xc2\xa0 And so I wonder if you think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be looking for health care and going to the exchanges any time soon.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say a couple of things about reports on personnel moves at the White House, which is the level of accuracy is inversely proportional to the quality of the sources.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So can we get your take on it then?\xc2\xa0 So we can get the most accurate version, let\xe2\x80\x99s get it from you.</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have a great job that I love.</p>\n<p class="p2">Yes, sir.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden with Polish President Komorowski this morning.\xc2\xa0 President Komorowski said he was not surprised of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s move in Ukraine because the Russian budget defense had grown 400 percent in the last eight years, and he criticized NATO members who have scaled back their defense spending.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree or believe that NATO members, considering the Ukrainian crisis, should reconsider their military spending?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see those particular comments, but I can certainly understand the concern and suspicion on behalf of Polish officials with regards to what Russia has been doing in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 I think that if you look at overall military spending by this country, say, from 10 years ago, you\xe2\x80\x99d see dramatic increases, even as we now rationalize our military spending after having ended one war and being in the process of ending another.</p>\n<p class="p2">What I would also say is that if you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s submitted budget, it contains within it both a topline for defense spending and an additional $25 billion through the security and investment fund that we certainly hope Congress will support, because we believe that is an appropriate additional amount of spending that we should see in our defense budget.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And how about the NATO members?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait until we talk to NATO, or hear what the institution itself has to say.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have at my fingertips figures on defense spending by NATO members.</p>\n<p class="p2">April.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on two subjects; one on health care.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re over 5 million enrolled.\xc2\xa0 What is the anticipation of this White House for March 31st?\xc2\xa0 What are your numbers for March 31st?\xc2\xa0 What are you expecting?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Now, you know I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that, April.</p>\n<p class="p3">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p>\n<p class="p3">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can tell you is that we have a lot of people who have signed up and there are going to be more.\xc2\xa0 Our goal has always been to get a substantial number and for it to be demographically and geographically allocated in a way that allows the marketplaces to function effectively.\xc2\xa0 We believe very strongly that we\xe2\x80\x99ll achieve those goals.</p>\n<p class="p2">There\xe2\x80\x99s been some talk over the months about what target figures there are, and CBO has made estimates and revised estimates, and I can point you to the CBO for the CBO\xe2\x80\x99s figures. What I can tell you is, since the very, very rocky start that this enrollment period endured, we have seen substantial interest rewarded with an ability consummated to enroll in insurance coverage through the marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">The purpose of the law was to make sure that Americans across the country had options available to them for quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that is being realized.\xc2\xa0 We have a lot of work to do.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re 13 days out.\xc2\xa0 A lot of people can and will still enroll, and we are doing a multifaceted campaign to reach as many people as we can so that they know what their options are and they know that March 31st is the deadline and they need to enroll by then or they won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to until next year.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So was it out of the realm of possibility that 7 million could be met?\xc2\xa0 Especially as this weekend the President told those workers at QSSI that he\xe2\x80\x99s anticipating large numbers to come in on the site and through the other sites that are linked to the federal government to register.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all learned through hard experience not to predict success but to do the hard work necessary to create success when it comes to this effort.\xc2\xa0 And there are a lot of people working extremely hard to ensure that the website is functioning, that all the various issues that need to be resolved as we smooth out the transition here are being resolved effectively for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And that work is going to continue right up until the deadline, and it will continue beyond that in the various efforts that need to continue to work.</p>\n<p class="p2">So what we feel positive about is that since the wretched start to healthcare.gov, we have seen a system that has functioned effectively for the millions of Americans who want it to work for them.\xc2\xa0 And it was on us to fix the problems, and some very talented people worked hard to make that happen.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">We\xe2\x80\x99ve got 13 days left, and I want everybody -- and I know the audience isn\xe2\x80\x99t huge -- but anybody who is out there watching should be aware that March 31st is the deadline and they need to make sure they have the information they want and need so that they can enroll by March 31st.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And last topic.\xc2\xa0 What would it take to see a G8 again versus a G7?\xc2\xa0 I mean, what would it take for Russia to come back into the fold?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put it in terms of that institution and the meetings and the summits it holds.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the suspension of preparations for that G8 Summit are the result -- that that suspension is the result of the actions that Russia has taken.\xc2\xa0 So the positive that would come out of Russia reversing course might include restoring preparations for the G8 in general, but I think the positives are far greater than that as a general matter.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jared.\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Jared, and then Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You described the costs to Russia as real and significant, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been effective.\xc2\xa0 Can you at this point point to any hesitation or any reversal of course that Russia has made due to the sanctions and the other costs that the United States has put into place?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I want to congratulate you on the penetrating question.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very clear that Russia continues to pursue a course that is in direct violation of international law, that directly contradicts its obligations under international treaties and understandings and memoranda that it has with Ukraine and other nations.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the actions we\xe2\x80\x99re taking, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why the costs will increase until Russia changes course.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But at this point you can count no successes?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what\xe2\x80\x99s happened today.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure your point, except that as long as Russia -- I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re reinforcing the point.\xc2\xa0 Yes, if Russia refuses to change course, it will incur more costs imposed by us, imposed by our friends and allies around the world, and imposed in general by the global economy.</p>\n<p class="p2">Jon.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want a couple clarifications.\xc2\xa0 You said the United States will never recognize this annexation that Russia has done today.\xc2\xa0 Does that mean that the sanctions that have been put in place are going to remain in place until Russia reverses what it has done?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sanctions will increase.\xc2\xa0 Designations will be forthcoming.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to put a pin on what the ongoing consequences of that kind of action would be.\xc2\xa0 What I can say without question is that this action, the results of the referendum, and the attempt to annex a region of Ukraine illegally will never be recognized by the United States or the international community.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And should we then assume -- and I think you strongly implied it, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll just ask directly -- the G8 Summit in Sochi will not happen unless Russia reverses course?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I can say right now, Jon, is that preparations for that summit have been suspended.\xc2\xa0 Summits don\xe2\x80\x99t occur without preparations; those preparations don\xe2\x80\x99t look likely to be resumed any time soon.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement to make about that at this time.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">We are focused on, as we have been throughout this situation, providing support to Ukraine, rallying the international community in opposition to these actions, and conveying very clearly to the Russians what we believe are very sensible options for them to take when it comes to ensuring that their interests in Ukraine are protected and recognized.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the seven Russians that were sanctioned, assets freezed -- can you tell us, do any of them have assets in the United States?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not information I have.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Treasury for those kinds of questions.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is those named in the seven -- there were four others under the other designation -- the seven you mention are very well known and prominent members of the Russian government or the Duma, and they fall under the category of Russian government officials that was spelled out in the executive order.\xc2\xa0 That executive order contains within it expansive authorities for the designation of other individuals and entities.\xc2\xa0 And what I can tell you is that you should expect further action to be taken as Russia continues down this path.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a political question.\xc2\xa0 Earlier today, the Chairman of the Republican Party predicted a Republican \xe2\x80\x9ctsunami\xe2\x80\x9d this fall.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if political forecasters here at the White House see signs of a Republican \xe2\x80\x9ctsunami\xe2\x80\x9d on the horizon?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting choice of words.\xc2\xa0 But I think that the President is focused on and Democrats are focused on a message that supports the policy priorities that we have, which consist of steps we can take to expand opportunity and reward hard work and responsibility in this country.\xc2\xa0 And that policy approach is supported by a substantial percentage of Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we approach this election cycle, because elections in the end are about who makes the decisions going forward in Congress, in this case when it comes to policy.</p>\n<p class="p2">And we\xe2\x80\x99re always engaged in a debate about what the proper policies are when it comes to how do we grow our economy, how do we expand opportunity, how do we reward hard work.\xc2\xa0 What to me doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like a particularly substantive argument is that we\xe2\x80\x99re against everything they\xe2\x80\x99re for and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you about what we\xe2\x80\x99re for.\xc2\xa0 It certainly does leave the opening for those who might make the counter argument that, therefore, the policies that helped precipitate the worst recession since the Great Depression, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a great place to be.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree with your predecessor, Robert Gibbs, on the likelihood of the Republicans taking over the Senate?\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- the Republicans --</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see him say that was likely.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely at all.\xc2\xa0 I think the Senate is going to be retained by Democrats for the reasons I just described.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said of the G7 side meeting next week that they would discuss modes of assistance to Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 A Senate delegation that went over there late last week or whatever, Senator John McCain at the very least has come back and said that the United States and NATO should consider sending some kind of defensive military hardware -- anti-aircraft, anti-tank hardware, whatever.\xc2\xa0 Is that one of the modes of assistance that will be considered at that meeting next week?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have said -- and I\xe2\x80\x99ll repeat -- that we are reviewing requests by the Ukrainian government, and we are -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 Our focus, however, remains on supporting economic and diplomatic measures aimed at de-escalating the situation in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing a variety of requests and running a process that evaluates what forms of assistance we and our partners can provide aimed at a focus that still hopes to see this situation de-escalate rather than escalate.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have they requested significant amounts of military?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Ukrainian government.</p>\n<p class="p3">Alexis, then Roger.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one quick question to follow up.\xc2\xa0 Because a lot of the relationships, international relationships with Russia are under some scrutiny or reevaluation, do you happen to know whether the World Trade Organization is something that Russia might lose its membership in?\xc2\xa0 It worked so hard to get into the WTO.\xc2\xa0 Is that at risk?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard that specific conversation.\xc2\xa0 I think that, in general, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s credibility and stature internationally is affected by these actions.\xc2\xa0 The system that is in place through organizations with broad international membership that affect trade and politics, if you will, through the United Nations and other organizations depend on a fealty to the rule of law, a shared commitment to resolve differences through legal means.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">And what we have seen of late by the actions taken by the Russians in Crimea is an undermining of and a violation of those principles that undergird that structure that supports all of these international institutions.\xc2\xa0 So it certainly affects their standing within the world community.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know at this point how to answer questions about status or membership within any specific organization.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p3">Roger, last question.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President in Poland this morning talked about diversifying the region\xe2\x80\x99s energy supply.\xc2\xa0 Can you talk a little bit more about what the Vice President has in mind and what possibly the U.S. role will be?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that there has been a lot of focus, for good reason, on the secure energy needs of Europe in general and which nations depend on which other nations for their energy supplies.\xc2\xa0 What we have said is that we\xe2\x80\x99re taking immediate steps to assist Ukraine, including in the area of energy security, energy efficiency and energy sector reform.\xc2\xa0 In addition, we understand that there has been no interruption of oil and natural gas exports from Russia to Ukraine and Europe.\xc2\xa0 European gas inventories, as I think I pointed out the other day, are well above normal levels at this time due to a milder than usual winter in Europe and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months if necessary.</p>\n<p class="p2">It\xe2\x80\x99s also important when you look at the question of energy security and Ukraine, that any disruption to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy shipment to Ukraine and Europe is a lose-lose situation for everyone, with Russia being the biggest loser.\xc2\xa0 They depend heavily on Europe and Ukraine as critical export markets for its natural gas, and they earn something like $50 billion per year from those sales.\xc2\xa0 You remember that a lot of the supplies to Europe run through Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re evaluating steps that Ukraine can take when it comes to energy security to energy efficiency and energy sector reform, and mindful of all the things that I just mentioned.</p>\n<p class="p2">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This would be on the agenda for The Hague next week, you think?</p>\n<p class="p2">MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get more specific than I was earlier.\xc2\xa0 Ukraine is the subject, will be the principal subject of that conversation.\xc2\xa0 I obviously leave it up to the leaders to decide the particulars.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p class="p2">END<br/>\n\t1:03 P.M.
