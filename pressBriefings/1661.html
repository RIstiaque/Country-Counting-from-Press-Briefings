EST</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 How\'s everyone today?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hi, Robert, how are you?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Good, how about you guys?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How\'s your new radio?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I now have three radios.\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I assume, won\'t ask a question without giving me a big screen TV -- it\'s still in the box.\xc2\xa0 So, you know, when I get my 60-inch TV from NBC, we\'ll be -- (laughter.)</div> <div class="legacy-para">Go ahead, what do you guys have?</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jobs?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 You know, obviously, one more piece of evidence to demonstrate how deep -- how deep of a recession we\'re in.\xc2\xa0 And as the President has often said, that it\'s going to get worse before it gets better.\xc2\xa0 We\'ve now lost 2 million jobs in just the last three months.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I think one of the things that\'s important about today\'s trip is that we\'re going to -- we\'re going to a place to show that the Recovery and Reinvestment Plan will begin to make a difference.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, what did you say?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 That the event we\'re going to will show that the Recovery and Reinvestment Plan is beginning to make a difference.\xc2\xa0 These are cops that weren\'t going to be hired, that are now, because of stimulus money that the city is getting, able to -- instead of laying off the Police Academy force before they get their badges, put them on the street and keep the community safe.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But there\'s no doubt that we have a long way to go to get this economy moving again, and the jobs numbers are one more reminder of that.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, why not say we are not going to let the U.S. auto industry -- we\'re not going to let GM go bankrupt?\xc2\xa0 Obviously there was a run -- a little bit, the fears of bankruptcy at GM.\xc2\xa0 Why not say, you know what, whatever the line is, that\'s the line we\'re drawing.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 GM has sent, with Chrysler, their plan for restructure, which was required for the loans they got from the previous administration.\xc2\xa0 The team is looking through those plans and figuring out how to be the best partner in what\'s next for the auto industry.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So bankruptcy can\'t be ruled out?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 But here\'s -- here\'s what I think the President was very clear about saying in front of Congress, which was we need a strengthened, retooled and restructured and re-imagined auto industry in this country.\xc2\xa0 Whether the auto industry as we have it now is exactly what we have in a year is something I think is going to be determined by a lot of different factors.</div> <div class="legacy-para">But understand this, Chuck, that we all saw the auto sales figures either earlier this -- I think they were earlier this week or late last week -- shows real steep drops in year-to-year auto purchases -- so much so that now Toyota, a company that most used to hold up as a model for other auto companies, asked the Japanese government for help, because right now the number of cars -- we\'re basically on an annual sales track of about 8 million -- 8 to 9 million cars.\xc2\xa0 You know, obviously in the -- in very strong years, it\'s not uncommon to see 15 million cars sold.</div> <div class="legacy-para">So the best way to get the auto industry back up on its feet and selling cars again is to get the overall economy going.\xc2\xa0 You\'ve got a lot of different -- you\'ve got a lot of different sort of aches and pains, but one sickness -- and that\'s the overall economy.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you about the trip today, and then a question about the FDIC?\xc2\xa0 In terms of the trip today, you\'re going to highlight 25 jobs saved -- and we\'ve lost 651,000, I believe, last month.\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, do you think this makes even a dent in the psyche of the American people?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, I mean, you know, let\'s -- I think if -- I think on that scale, you\'d never even undertake -- you\'d never even undertake any action to seek cuts in wasteful spending unless you saved trillions of dollars with the stroke of one pen.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I mean, I think it\'s a -- you know, I\'m sure it\'s one viewpoint.\xc2\xa0 I think it\'s a bit cynical to think that the only jobs created or saved today will be the 25 or 27 that the President is going to see in Columbus.\xc2\xa0 I think it demonstrates for the American people that the President has a plan to get the economy moving again, that we\'re seeing results from that plan, and that the American people -- because they understand this -- know it\'s going to take us a while to get out of this hole, but that there are brighter days ahead.</div> <div class="legacy-para">I\'m always amazed -- you know, a week ago we were talking down the economy.\xc2\xa0 This week we\'re not talking the economy up to the heights of which we -- you know, I mean, there\'s -- it\'s a moving set of hurdles.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You guys doing anything on the Hill to deal with this -- the fact that the spending bill got held up?\xc2\xa0 Are you guys --</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I will check with.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know anything specifically from our legislative team.\xc2\xa0 I know the -- you know, if a continuing resolution comes down, obviously the President will sign that.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know what -- I don\'t know when that might be.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Dodd bill that would allow the FDIC to borrow $500 billion from the Treasury, that would require White House support.\xc2\xa0 Would you support that if it passed?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I would have to -- to be honest with you, I have not looked at that.\xc2\xa0 Let me get a little bit more information; I\'ll have somebody pull that for the ride back.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t -- I\'m not as familiar with that one, so let me --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the nuclear pact with Russia that was unsigned by Bush after the Georgian invasion -- do you support renewing that or re-picking that back up again?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Let me check with State and see if that\'s a topic that the Secretary --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- raised it.</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 -- yes, that the Secretary and the Foreign Minister will speak about today.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Anything else, guys?\xc2\xa0 All right.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You got a week ahead?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A very rough one.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\'s going to be that bad, huh?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 No -- excuse me -- most of this -- most of the next week will be in Washington.\xc2\xa0 He\'ll go to Camp David with his family tomorrow and return on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Events in Washington Monday.\xc2\xa0 A speech that I will have a little bit more information on probably on the way back, on Tuesday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The speech is Tuesday?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 A speech Tuesday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Topic?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have that for you also on the way back.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it --</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it in D.C.?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 As I understand it, though, we do not have domestic travel next week.\xc2\xa0 So we\'ll be in D.C. Monday through Friday.</div> <div class="legacy-para">Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Any topics at all for the week?</div> <div class="legacy-para">MR.
