Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>\n\t1:22 P.M. EDT<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Good afternoon, everybody. \xc2\xa0Happy Monday. \xc2\xa0Before I get to your questions, let me just -- I wanted to start today by acknowledging the death of NPR journalist, David Gilkey, and his colleague, Zabihullah Tamanna. \xc2\xa0Both of them were killed while reporting on the conflict in Afghanistan over the weekend.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know there are a number of people in this room who worked with Mr. Gilkey and deeply respected his professionalism and his commitment to going anywhere, even dangerous places like Afghanistan, repeatedly, to get the story and to tell the story in photos and on video. \xc2\xa0His work is a testament to the courage and passion that is displayed by professional journalists around the world every day who put their lives at risk to tell the story of people whose voices would otherwise go unheard.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tIn short, we owe these professionals a debt of gratitude for the risks they take and the service that they provide. \xc2\xa0Mr. Gilkey was honored on many occasions by his colleagues for his work, including by the White House News Photographers Association as the best photographer of the year in 2010. \xc2\xa0The President had an opportunity to meet Mr. Gilkey when he greeted that year\xe2\x80\x99s award-winning journalists in the Oval Office, like he does every year.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI know there are a lot of broken hearts in this room and over at NPR headquarters over the loss of your beloved colleagues. \xc2\xa0Please know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone here at the White House, including the President and the First Lady, are with those who are mourning the death of Mr. Gilkey and Mr. Tamanna today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo after that sad news, Darlene, we can go to questions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you. \xc2\xa0A question about Congress -- lawmakers are coming back to town this week. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99ll be here for about six weeks or so before they go off to the political conventions and then the August recess. \xc2\xa0Besides money for Zika and the bill to help Puerto Rico with its debt crisis, what other legislation would the White House like to see Congress send over here before they break?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Darlene, obviously you noted two priorities. \xc2\xa0Puerto Rico and Zika are priorities because they are, at this point, emergency situations. \xc2\xa0The situation facing the 3.5 million Americans who live in Puerto Rico is increasingly dire. \xc2\xa0We talked about the impact of the government\xe2\x80\x99s financial challenges on the school system and on the health care system in Puerto Rico, and those challenges become even greater and have more severe consequences as they worsen. \xc2\xa0And so it\xe2\x80\x99s time for Congress to get that done.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think the situation with Zika is similar. \xc2\xa0There was an opportunity that Congress had to provide funding, consistent with the request that our public health professionals have made, starting back to February. \xc2\xa0But Republicans in Congress have dragged their feet and have still not come forward with a funding plan consistent with what our public health professionals say is necessary to do everything possible to protect the American people from the Zika virus.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo those are certainly two priorities, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that you noted them. \xc2\xa0Other priorities that come to mind that we believe are worthy of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s attention in this period -- the first would be dealing with the opioids epidemic in this country. \xc2\xa0The President put forward a specific budget proposal -- again, back in February -- to dedicate an additional $1 billion in funding to expand treatment options for people in communities all across the country who are dealing with opioid addiction. \xc2\xa0Too many innocent lives have been lost as a result of this significant problem. \xc2\xa0And for years this has been treated as a law enforcement problem and it certainly has to do with our criminal justice system, but there are public health questions that are raised here, too, and we could certainly have an impact on this epidemic if more treatment options were available to people who are dealing with this addiction. \xc2\xa0That would certainly start by congressional funding for treatment centers that would expand the number of personnel and the number of beds that are available to treat people with significant addiction challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously we continue to be concerned about the Republicans in the Senate refusing to give a hearing and a vote to the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99d obviously like to see Republicans get that done. \xc2\xa0If we were following along the timeline for previous Supreme Court nominees to be considered and confirmed by the Senate, Chief Judge Garland would have been confirmed months ago. \xc2\xa0But the fact is, here we are in June, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominee has not even gotten a hearing. \xc2\xa0And, again, this is evidence of Republicans failing to do their job. \xc2\xa0It has consequences for our justice system. \xc2\xa0It certainly has consequences for the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time for the Senate to give him a hearing and a vote before they go on their six or seven-week-long summer vacation. \xc2\xa0The American people and our justice system would certainly benefit from that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are a whole host of other things that could certainly fall in this category. \xc2\xa0Things like making progress on criminal justice reform is something that we would like to see before the Congress leaves for the summer. \xc2\xa0That certainly is not an exhaustive list, but I think that gives you a good idea of what our priorities are.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0With the Democratic primaries about to wrap up, what guidance do you have for us on when we can expect the President to make an endorsement?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to make on the timing of a presidential endorsement at this point. \xc2\xa0Those of you who traveled with the President to Florida over the weekend heard him discuss at fundraisers in South Florida on Friday night his approach to this issue. \xc2\xa0And his view continues to be that the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates are in broad agreement about what priorities are worth fighting for. \xc2\xa0And the commitment to a set of values -- particularly around fairness and justice and equality and expanding economic opportunity for everybody -- those are things that Democrats all across the country agree on. \xc2\xa0And those are the values and priorities that the two Democratic candidates for President have been campaigning on. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd a campaign platform that is built on those priorities has won both candidates strong support all across the country. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s a really good thing for our party, and I think it augers well for Democratic prospects in the general election. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99re not there yet. \xc2\xa0There are still votes that have to be cast in both New Jersey and California, and the President has made a decision that he wants to give those voters an opportunity to make their voice heard before he weighs in.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Finally, will the President attend the funeral on Friday for Muhammad Ali? \xc2\xa0And if he does not go, who will the White House send to represent him?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re still taking a look at the plans that are being made for Muhammad Ali\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. \xc2\xa0Many of you saw the statement that was issued by the White House on Friday -- or on Saturday, and obviously the President has strong feelings about Muhammad Ali and what is so unique about him and the unique message that he delivers about what our country is all about. \xc2\xa0So obviously the President and the First Family are mourning his loss, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you on the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule. \xc2\xa0But we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you posted on that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tTim.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just briefly on Judge Garland again, are there any meetings scheduled with Republicans this week or in coming weeks?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update on Chief Judge Garland\xe2\x80\x99s meeting schedule. \xc2\xa0I know that he does have a meeting with Senator Cantwell on the books for later this week. \xc2\xa0But we can get you some more details about that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously the case that we have made to individual senators is that, traditionally, private meetings have just been the prelude to public hearings that are convened by the Judiciary Committee. \xc2\xa0And there are 16 Republican senators who have already met with Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Many of those Republicans walked away from that meeting saying quite good things about Chief Judge Garland. \xc2\xa0Senator Portman called him \xe2\x80\x9can impressive guy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Senator Toomey called him \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very smart, very, very knowledgeable.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Senator Graham called him \xe2\x80\x9cwell qualified.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo our view is that it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard for Republican senators to justify having a private conversation with Chief Judge Garland -- by all accounts having those conversations go well -- but yet refuse to convene a public hearing. \xc2\xa0After all, it is those Republican senators who have said that American voters should have a role in the process. \xc2\xa0Well, what better way could the American people have a role in the process than to give the American people the opportunity to hear directly from Chief Judge Garland himself, let him make the case for why he has the judgment and the experience to serve with distinction on the Supreme Court. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe certainly believe that he would do that if given the opportunity, to participate in a public hearing. \xc2\xa0And I suspect that\xe2\x80\x99s precisely why Republicans won\xe2\x80\x99t give it to him. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s rather unfortunate. \xc2\xa0It is certainly inconsistent with, I think, widespread notions of fairness, and it certainly is inconsistent with the constitutional responsibilities that are vested in the United States Senate.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There were 19 Republicans that were saying they would want to meet with him, and he\xe2\x80\x99s met with 16. \xc2\xa0Do you see the three coming together?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the updates on the schedule, but we certainly have been in touch with their offices to try to schedule something.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And just moving to Fallujah. \xc2\xa0Since Friday, some of the leaders of the Iran-backed militias have bickered with the Iraq military. \xc2\xa0They want to see the Fallujah fight go faster, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t like the fact that the Iraq military is moving up equipment to Mosul, the next fight. \xc2\xa0Does the White House have any concern about this bickering?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Tim, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear from the beginning that the United States and our coalition partners are prepared to be supportive of those Iraqi forces that are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government. \xc2\xa0And those are forces that are committed to minimizing civilian casualties and protecting the people of Fallujah who have suffered so much under ISIL\xe2\x80\x99s occupation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThese are basic humanitarian principles that they are committed to observe. \xc2\xa0And we certainly noted the statements from Iraqi political and religious leaders demonstrating their commitment to those principles. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s not much that I have to say about the Shia militias and their preferences. \xc2\xa0Obviously, the organization that we\xe2\x80\x99re cooperating with and advising and assisting is the Iraqi central government and the forces that are operating under their command and control.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0One more on Fallujah. \xc2\xa0If the Islamic State is pushed out, to what extent is the White House concerned about the aftermath and sectarian violence ensuing after that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we obviously are concerned about the current humanitarian situation inside of Fallujah. \xc2\xa0There are all kinds of heinous reports about the way that ISIL is treating the citizens of that city. \xc2\xa0There are reports that some of the citizens are being used as human shields, and in some cases, even worse. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s the point of this operation in the first place, is to try to drive ISIL out of the city. \xc2\xa0We do believe it is very important that once Fallujah is liberated, that the forces that succeeded in liberating the city abide by basic humanitarian standards. \xc2\xa0We certainly would not tolerate using this conflict against ISIL as an opportunity to exacerbate sectarian tensions in that region of the world. \xc2\xa0And we certainly would not condone using this conflict as cover to inflame sectarian conflict. \xc2\xa0That\'s why it\'s important that these security forces are operating under the command and control of the Iraqi central government because the Iraqi central government has demonstrated a commitment to pursuing an inclusive agenda that represents the diversity of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s population. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is certainly something that we\'re mindful of. \xc2\xa0But as I noted in my answer to your previous question, we welcome the statements from Iraqi political and religious leaders about the need to conduct this operation in a way that minimizes civilian casualties and protects the people of Fallujah. \xc2\xa0And that certainly is what we would expect those forces to do.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tOlivier.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0A couple on the announcement on the President\xe2\x80\x99s travel to Poland and Spain. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a reference in the part about Poland about NATO providing stability in regions other than the North Atlantic region. \xc2\xa0Obviously NATO invoked Article 5 for Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0Are there other parts of the world that you think NATO can play a bigger role?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the statement was referencing NATO\xe2\x80\x99s role in Afghanistan, and that\'s the reason it was worded the way that it was. \xc2\xa0We obviously welcome the substantial contributions that our NATO partners have made to supporting the Afghan government in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0And that kind of ongoing support will be critical to Afghanistan and the international community of achieving our objectives in that country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And on a considerably lighter note, the Spanish leg of the visit, the President\xe2\x80\x99s timetable there overlaps with part of the San Fermin Festival, which includes the running of the bulls. (Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Guess where I\'m going with this.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Someone did their homework today. (Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s going to miss the big one, but there are other runnings. \xc2\xa0Any interest in watching the spectacle? \xc2\xa0Would he go to Pamplona? \xc2\xa0Would he be interested in any of that?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I suspect he probably is interested in that. \xc2\xa0I\'ve not spoken to him about it. \xc2\xa0But I don\'t know whether or not the President\xe2\x80\x99s itinerary will allow for witnessing that rather interesting event.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0All right, Justin -- birthday boy. \xc2\xa0Happy birthday.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0That seemed somewhat less than genuine, Justin. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At least, like, now when I know nothing it\'s not because of my age. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0It\'s just on me. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0I wanted to go back and ask you about it last week, but Donald Trump has intensified some of his comments about federal judges, and I\'m wondering if you think those comments are racist.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I know that there\xe2\x80\x99s been plenty of commentary on the presumptive Republican nominee\xe2\x80\x99s comments. \xc2\xa0And the presumptive Republican nominee certainly does not seem to strain in prompting people to offer an opinion about his comments. \xc2\xa0But I\'m going to resist the urge to do that, but let me make one observation about that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSome who have weighed in with their opinion are Republicans who serve in the United States Senate, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve had some rather pointed things to say about the impact that his comments could have on our justice system in this country. \xc2\xa0I guess I would just point out that it\'s a little ironic for Republicans in the Senate who say they have concerns about the Republican presidential nominee\xe2\x80\x99s views as it relates to judges to also say that they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to confirm any judges to preserve the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to potentially make those appointments.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThat certainly is true at the Supreme Court level, and it is additional evidence of the uncomfortable position that Republicans have tried to adopt here when it comes to not doing their job on the Supreme Court -- on considering the President\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court nominee. \xc2\xa0But, look, this applies to other federal judges as well. \xc2\xa0There are a variety of very well-qualified Obama nominees to judges in both at the appellate level and at the district level who would fill vacancies on courts that have declared judicial emergencies. \xc2\xa0So this is not just the President deciding willy-nilly that he wants to fill judicial vacancies. \xc2\xa0In some cases, you have judges in these districts and in these circuits basically saying, we need help in order to manage the caseload and in order to prevent the kind of backlog that would potentially delay justice. \xc2\xa0But yet, Republicans, even when faced with well-qualified nominees, some of whom have earned the support of Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, blocking the nominees is indefensible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the truth is I think that position would be indefensible even if they hadn\'t already stated their own concerns about the ability of the Republican presidential nominee to discuss maturely our system of justice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I think part of the reason I ask is I remember a few months ago during some of the heat of the Republican nomination contest, you guys went out of your way to say that the comments by some of the Republican nominees, if not denounced by Republican lawmakers, should kind of be a strike against them in their campaigns. \xc2\xa0And so at a point where there have been some sort of high-profile endorsements but then criticism from Republican senators, like you mentioned, do you guys think that, one, this is an issue that voters should be paying attention to, what Donald Trump has said about judges? \xc2\xa0And two, do you think Republican leaders should maybe withdraw their endorsements of Donald Trump over this issue?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me say it this way. \xc2\xa0I\'m not surprised that there are many Republicans, in Congress at least who have chosen to overlook these controversial comments and continue to support the presumptive Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0Those are the same Republicans who elected a man who describes himself as \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Duke without the baggage\xe2\x80\x9d to a leadership position in the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0These are the same Republicans, both in Congress and in legislative bodies across the country, who have, in some cases, admitted openly that they support voting restrictions in a way that would disadvantage minority voters and enhance the prospects of Republican candidates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo that\'s why I guess I find the reluctance of current Republican officeholders disavowing their endorsement totally unsurprising. \xc2\xa0This is not an exception, this is the rule. \xc2\xa0And it\'s an unfortunate one. \xc2\xa0And, yes, I do suspect that it\'s one that people across the country will notice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0An American sailor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving and causing a crash in Okinawa over the weekend. \xc2\xa0This is obviously on the heels of the charges that were brought against an American contractor and a real intense meeting between Prime Minister Abe and President Obama. \xc2\xa0I\'m wondering if the President or anybody at the White House has been in contact with the Japanese government about this, and secondly, what it says to the President\xe2\x80\x99s pledge to sort of reevaluate how the base in Okinawa has been operating. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Justin, we are aware that on June 4th, a vehicle driven by a U.S. Navy sailor stationed in Okinawa was involved in a three-car accident in which some people sustained injuries. \xc2\xa0The United States deeply regrets this accident took place, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and their families.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe United States is fully cooperating with Japanese officials on this investigation, and the United States will continue to do all we can to ensure that DOD personnel serving in Japan conduct themselves with the highest standards.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI\'d refer you to the Department of Defense for more recent conversations that may have taken place between military officials and their Japanese counterparts. \xc2\xa0I did make note of the announcement by Lieutenant General Lawrence Nicholson, who is the highest-ranking U.S. military official in Okinawa, in which he noted American solidarity with the Okinawan people. \xc2\xa0And I know that there were some changes to the rules and regulations in Okinawa to try to address this situation. \xc2\xa0These are referred to in the military as modified liberty regulations for 30 days that would essentially outlaw the consumption of alcohol by servicemembers for the next 30 days. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAgain, that is a decision that is made by military leaders in Okinawa who are seeking to address what is understandably a very sensitive situation in the eyes of the Japanese people. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tRon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just to follow up on the Trump question, when you were asked about the comments he\xe2\x80\x99s made about the judge, you referred to what Republicans have been saying about it. \xc2\xa0What is the White House, the President\xe2\x80\x99s attitude about these? \xc2\xa0Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you answer that directly?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0There are, as I struggle to try to convey here -- the presumptive Republican nominee often says things that are viewed as controversial or prompt a public response. \xc2\xa0And, look, I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to respond to every potentially controversial thing that he may have to say.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut what I think is relevant is to note the reaction of other Republicans. \xc2\xa0And I think that the people will take a measure of that party and that party\xe2\x80\x99s office holders based on how they respond to the situation.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is there some line that he has to cross before you -- how do you determine that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I will cop to the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s relatively arbitrary. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaking of lines, what is the line that the President endorses?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think that this is rooted largely in his own judgment. \xc2\xa0And he discussed at the town hall that he participated in in Elkhart his view that Democratic voters across the country should have an opportunity to decide, and that after the Democratic voters in New Jersey and California weigh in tomorrow, we may have a better sense of where the race is headed. \xc2\xa0But until then, the President himself made a decision to withhold judgment. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tNow, the other thing I would point out is we\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen Senator Sanders and his campaign indicate that they appreciate the President going to great lengths to try to be fair; that they\xe2\x80\x99ve acknowledged that Secretary Clinton is somebody that is a friend of President Obama, somebody that served for four years with distinction in the Obama administration. \xc2\xa0And we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Sanders officials that they appreciate the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to fairness and to allowing Democratic voters to determine the outcome here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is getting the majority of superdelegates and pledged delegates clinching the nomination?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think, again, Democratic officials and the candidates themselves will have to make their own decision about which metric they\xe2\x80\x99re going to follow. \xc2\xa0I think many of your news organizations are considering this same question. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What is the White House considering?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0And I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to watch the situation. \xc2\xa0We\xe2\x80\x99re going to give Democratic voters the opportunity to weigh in. \xc2\xa0But certainly, somebody who claims a majority of the pledged and superdelegates has a strong case to make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0How concerned is the President about the possibility of a contested convention, or if this going on for weeks to come? \xc2\xa0How damaging could that be? \xc2\xa0Or perhaps as you view the previous months, as a robust process. \xc2\xa0Is that a positive or a negative?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, again, I think it depends on how this process plays out, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to reach a conclusion in the abstract. \xc2\xa0What I can say is --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty -- this is not abstract. \xc2\xa0I mean, this is pretty clear in terms of what --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really clear because we don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether or not this is going to happen or not. \xc2\xa0And what kind of support each candidate has taken to the convention and how they conduct themselves in the weeks leading up to the convention and then once they arrive in Philadelphia -- I think all of that is hard to determine. \xc2\xa0Those kinds of details matter.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut let me just say, the President made clear at that fundraiser in South Florida on Friday that the stakes in this election are really high. \xc2\xa0And the Democratic Party cannot afford to take lightly the risk that is posed by the potential of electing the presumptive Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President intends, certainly through the fall, if not earlier, to engage in this campaign and to engage in this debate about the future of our country. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity that the President relishes.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI would also point out that this actually puts the President in a relatively unique place in our history. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been at least a generation, if not longer, since you had a two-term President in his final year in office in demand by party leaders, including by the party nominee, on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd President Obama does have a strong track record and a deep reservoir of support all across the country -- and not just among Democrats -- to make a strong case that would benefit Democrats, up and down the ballot. \xc2\xa0And I would anticipate that the President will spend a lot of time in the fall making a strong case, not just on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidate, but also on behalf of Democratic candidates up and down the ballot.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0All of which leads to the obvious question of, why wait? \xc2\xa0Why, as he said the other day, something about -- it just seems like political niceties that may, in fact, some would think, jeopardize the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 chance in November. \xc2\xa0Given his popularity, given his obvious determination and zeal to get out there and do it, I mean, why are we -- why are you just kind of -- why is he dancing around this?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, because the President does believe that, I would acknowledge. \xc2\xa0And I think the Sanders campaign would agree that the President has worked hard and gone to great lengths to try to be fair. \xc2\xa0And he certainly has a lot of respect for both candidates. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s met privately with both candidates in the middle of this campaign. \xc2\xa0But, look, the President does have a long, personal relationship with Secretary Clinton. \xc2\xa0She served as his Secretary of State for more than four years, for goodness sake.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the President has gone to great lengths to try to be hands off to give Democratic voters the opportunity to make a decision about who should represent our party in the general election. \xc2\xa0Now, I think the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s also true, Ron, is that the President has, on a couple of occasions, made a pretty forceful argument in support of Democratic candidates, even though we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who the Democratic nominee is going to be. \xc2\xa0And he did that most recently in his speech in Elkhart, where he made a compelling case about the wisdom of pursuing the priorities that both Democratic presidential candidates are advocating on the campaign trail.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if the President has not weighed in forcefully in support of Democrats. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s true he has not weighed in forcefully in support of one Democrat in the presidential race, but he certainly has been an ardent and effective advocate for Democratic values and Democratic priorities, even in the context of a contested nomination fight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMark.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On the issue of fairness to Senator Sanders, would President Obama be inclined to endorse Hillary Clinton if Bernie Sanders did not drop out between tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s primaries and the convention?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, at this point, we\xe2\x80\x99ll hold on the hypotheticals. \xc2\xa0And the President was clear -- again, in answering this question to a voter in Elkhart, or a citizen in Elkhart -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that person was voting or not -- but the President was pretty clear that once the voters in New Jersey and California have an opportunity to express their preference about who should represent the Democratic Party in the general election, then we may be in a position where we have a much greater sense of what the outcome is likely to be. \xc2\xa0But until then, we\xe2\x80\x99ll wait another 48 hours here and see how this plays out before we get too deep into the hypotheticals.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has the White House been in touch with the Clinton campaign about an announcement or campaigning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, the White House has been in touch with both campaigns throughout this nomination fight. \xc2\xa0And, look, the President has had individual conversations with both candidates throughout this nomination fight. \xc2\xa0Both candidates have been here at the White House, meeting privately with President Obama over the course of the last nine months or so. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained an open line of communication with both campaigns and with both candidates, and I would expect that to continue.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Lastly, why does President Obama believe that running scared in the fall campaign is a good strategy?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Because the context here is the President believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to take the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s decision to nominate a controversial figure lightly. \xc2\xa0Many of your news organizations have conducted polls -- some of which, certainly not all of which, but some of which indicate that either Democratic candidate would be a very heavy favorite in the general election. \xc2\xa0And the President, as he\xe2\x80\x99s said on a number of occasions, is feeling quite good about Democratic prospects in the fall, but he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s really important for Democrats to be motivated and to not take lightly the prospect of a general election contest between the Democratic nominee and the Republican nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Despite what the polls say, this is something that\xe2\x80\x99s worth fighting for. \xc2\xa0And the President certainly intends to devote a lot of time and energy to this debate, and he expects that people across the country will do the same thing, even if some polls indicate that the race is not likely to be particularly close.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Listening to the Democratic fundraiser speech on Friday evening, I got the feeling -- or reading the notes on it -- the transcript -- I got the feeling that if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the Constitution and it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for Michelle Obama, he would love to be running. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0Do you get that feeling talking to him as well?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, let me acknowledge that both of those sayings are significant obstacles. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He said Michelle was even more important.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Yes, he did. \xc2\xa0He did. \xc2\xa0But, look, there is no denying that the President relishes the opportunity that he has to spend time traveling across the country making a forceful case for the values that he\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated his career to fighting for. \xc2\xa0And I think that will be evident -- all of you will have an opportunity to cover the President when he\xe2\x80\x99s out making this argument in the fall. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason that many Democrats are hopeful that President Obama will be quite visible in this campaign. \xc2\xa0They\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful because he\xe2\x80\x99s good at making a case. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s good at making the case for the kinds of values that Democrats care about. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s good at making the case for a foreign policy that is smart about deploying our force and our influence around the world to advance our interests. \xc2\xa0The President is good at making a case about an economic strategy that\xe2\x80\x99s focused on expanding economic opportunity for everybody in America, particularly the middle class. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s good at making a forceful case for why it\xe2\x80\x99s so critically important for us to educate and upskill the next generation of American workers to compete in a 21st century economy. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s good at making a case for an America that\xe2\x80\x99s more just, that fights for equality and fairness. \xc2\xa0And he\xe2\x80\x99s good at making the case for an America that\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He made it sound like he\xe2\x80\x99d really like to be running.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I make it sound like the President is really looking forward to being actively engaged in this campaign. \xc2\xa0And, look, he\xe2\x80\x99s good at it. \xc2\xa0This is a strength of his. \xc2\xa0And the President is looking forward to working closely with, again, not just the Democratic nominee for President, but for Democratic candidates up and down the ballot. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd look, the stakes in this election are high. \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing that motivates the President, Mark, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a hobby, this is his life\xe2\x80\x99s work. \xc2\xa0This is his passion. \xc2\xa0And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that he feels strongly about. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s got a deep conviction about how important these issues are. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated his life to fighting for them. \xc2\xa0And he understands that who the next President is will have a significant impact on the trajectory of that fight. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd so the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t just looking forward to having some fun on the campaign trail, he\xe2\x80\x99s also looking forward to making an argument and making a case, because he understands the stakes are quite high.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s spoiling for a fight.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0He certainly is not going to shrink from it, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMichelle.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So we heard the President say that he has plenty of time to throw his support behind the nominee, but he also talked about running scared. \xc2\xa0And you cited these poll numbers that show a wider lead, but they were much, much tighter a short time ago. \xc2\xa0And when you look at the President\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, in May, showed Romney beating him. \xc2\xa0So how much store are you putting into poll numbers like that? \xc2\xa0And does the \xe2\x80\x9cplenty of time\xe2\x80\x9d have something to do with the fact that he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be close?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t put much stock in the poll numbers; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the President does, either. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he intends to be strongly supportive of what he expects will be a vigorous debate and a vigorous campaign. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut look, the reason that the President says that he\xe2\x80\x99s got plenty of time is informed by his own experience with this process. \xc2\xa0You\xe2\x80\x99ll recall back in 2008,when he was competing against then-Senator Clinton, that there was a much-longer-than-expected Democratic nomination contest, and there were concerns that were understandably expressed by people inside the Democratic Party and out about the impact that that longer-than-expected nomination contest would have on the prospects of the eventual party nominee.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe truth is -- and Senator Obama may not have said this at the time, but President Obama would tell you that that longer-than-expected campaign made him a better candidate, and it made him better on the stump. \xc2\xa0It made him better on the debate stage. \xc2\xa0And it gave his campaign the opportunity to build an organizational infrastructure coast to coast. \xc2\xa0And it put states in play in that presidential election that previously hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been -- states like Indiana and North Carolina and even Virginia at the time. \xc2\xa0People forget that that was not a state that was regularly referred to as a battleground state. \xc2\xa0It was sort of viewed as on the margins, but yet that\xe2\x80\x99s a state that President Obama won twice.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo the fact that the nomination process has gone on a little longer than expected is not necessarily a bad thing for the Democratic Party, but the point that the President is making is that once that primary contest comes to an end, once there is a nominee, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for all Democrats to be all in in this election, because the stakes are quite high.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So if he feels that there is enough risk there -- and there have been indications that this could be close, even recently -- for him to say a phrase like \xe2\x80\x9crunning scared,\xe2\x80\x9d isn\xe2\x80\x99t there a sense that, had he thrown his support behind someone earlier that maybe those numbers could have been wider earlier, maybe there could have been more momentum earlier on the other side? \xc2\xa0What do you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I think it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly easy to armchair-quarterback all of this. \xc2\xa0But, look, I think the President is quite proud of the way this nomination process has played out on the Democratic side. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s been a vigorous campaign. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been a robust debate. \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s been an opportunity for Democrats all across the country to understand exactly what our party\xe2\x80\x99s candidates are fighting for. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are many Republicans who would agree with me. \xc2\xa0Well, let me say it this way: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think many Republicans would say the same thing about the contest on their side of the aisle. \xc2\xa0What I would say about Democrats is that this contest has motivated and engaged Democrats all across the country around a core set of values that just about every Democrat can strongly support. \xc2\xa0And it will be -- as you allude to, it will be important for our party to be united around those values in a general election, but the fact that those are values that Democratic voters have in common I think will greatly enhance the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability and the eventual Democratic nominee\xe2\x80\x99s ability to unite the party around those values, and wage a vigorous general election campaign in states all across the country.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So these votes that you say the President is waiting for are going to happen on Tuesday. \xc2\xa0Is there any reason why he would not endorse Hillary Clinton on Wednesday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, without knowing the outcome of those contests, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hazard a guess. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But if the outcome is the opposite, then are you saying he would not endorse Hillary Clinton?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I\'m saying is mostly that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to make about the timing of a presidential endorsement. \xc2\xa0But I guess what I would say is the same thing that the President said last week, which is that we are likely to know a whole lot more about how this contest concludes once those votes are cast. \xc2\xa0But until then, we\'ll wait and see.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At the risk of being annoying, maybe I could ask it this way then: \xc2\xa0Why would he not endorse somebody on Wednesday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. \xc2\xa0Maybe he will. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMargaret. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks so much. \xc2\xa0You\'re not putting yourself out of misery here. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0It\'s all right. \xc2\xa0It\'s what I signed up for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So given the Tuesday primaries, can you at least say if it is too early and people are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating an endorsement this week?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, again, I think the President I think probably said this best last week when he said we\'re likely to know more about how this nomination process ends this week, based on the fact that you have two states with a whole lot of Democrats in them who are casting votes this week. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any news to make in terms of the timing of an endorsement, but we\'re going to learn more and we\'ll let those voters make their voice heard before we make any additional decisions about whether or not the President should weigh in.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That sounds like you\'re leaving the door open then.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President opened the door when he said last week that we would know more about the potential outcome here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0It\'s the start of Ramadan. \xc2\xa0In the statement that the White House put out there was comment in there that did seem very political given that there really is no one talking about a ban on Muslims other than the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump -- or at least there\'s no traction behind that kind of policy. \xc2\xa0Why did the White House feel that was necessary to put that political statement in something that\'s the start of a religious holiday?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I actually would describe it as a value statement because I think it is an American value that we do not impose a religious test on people who are seeking to enter the United States. \xc2\xa0And I would also point out that there\'s more than one Republican -- high-profile Republican who has indicated support for this very unwise, ill-advised policy. \xc2\xa0So I think a clear articulation of American values when it comes to freedom of religion is an entirely appropriate statement to make at the beginning of a religious holiday that is observed by millions of American Muslims.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Do you fear you\'re giving what some might dismiss as rhetoric, albeit damaging and perhaps dangerous rhetoric, some would say credence as a potential policy shift in the United States by putting it in a statement like that? \xc2\xa0I mean, it\'s one thing for a few Republicans to voice support. \xc2\xa0But in terms of actual traction as a change in a policy, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, this has been a policy proposal that has been hotly debated for months now, dating back to at least November. \xc2\xa0So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is much risk of this issue getting further attention because of its inclusion in this presidential statement. \xc2\xa0In fact, I think the White House and the President felt it was important to make an affirmative declaration about core American values, and not discriminating against people because of the way that they worship God. \xc2\xa0That\'s an important value and one that\'s worth giving voice to, and I think it\'s entirely appropriate to talk about the importance of freedom of religion and protecting religious liberty when you\'re marking the beginning of a religious holiday that\'s observed by millions of American Muslims.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is this kind of value statement, as you\'ve described it, this sort of thing we\'re going to hear from the President when he doe hit the campaign trail? \xc2\xa0I mean, is that how you and the President is viewing the necessity of his involvement -- that this is about not only his own legacy, but the legacy of U.S. values and policy here? \xc2\xa0It\'s not so much about the candidates as it is about the fate of those values as he\'s seeing himself defending?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, let me also hasten to add here that there are many, many well-known, prominent Republicans and national security experts of undeclared political persuasion who would strongly agree with the value statement that was included in the Ramadan statement. \xc2\xa0So I think that merits mentioning as well.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tLook, I think the stakes in this election are quite high because there are a number of important issues that hang in the balance. \xc2\xa0The President went to Elkhart last week and talked about the economic choices that the next President will have to make. \xc2\xa0The President has certainly made the economic decision-making and a question of those economic priorities a top priority since he\'s been in office. \xc2\xa0And the next President will have some important decisions to make about our economy. \xc2\xa0But look, there are a whole host of other issues that are important, too. \xc2\xa0Some of them relate to foreign policy and even relate to protecting core American values, like freedom of the press and an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and yes, religious liberty.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the White House getting a sense that the candidates are as enthusiastic as the President is about the campaign trail? \xc2\xa0I mean, do you have a full dance card requesting things and appearances so far? \xc2\xa0Or is this just an anticipation of what you think --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think you\'d have to go ask them. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You have not gotten those requests so far?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\'m saying that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t personally talked to many candidates for office, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you said that you have spoken with the campaigns -- the White House has. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0The White House has certainly been in touch with both presidential candidates and certainly campaigns beyond that. \xc2\xa0And yes, I would say as a general matter that there is interest on the part of Democratic candidates for the President being out on the campaign trail, aggressively making a case in support of the kinds of priorities that Democratic candidates across the country have been fighting for.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0A quick question on the schedule. \xc2\xa0It sounded like you weren\xe2\x80\x99t ruling out an attendance at some level at the Muhammad Ali funeral or eulogy on Friday. \xc2\xa0I\'m pretty sure there\'s also a significant date in the Obama household on Friday. \xc2\xa0Do you see those two things conflicting?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, we\'ve got some work to do on the schedule. \xc2\xa0But as we get the schedule locked down, we\'ll let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But it is possible.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly timeframe for both events, but as we get updates on the schedule we\'ll be sure to let you know.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tShannon.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There is a new book coming out on Mrs. Clinton by a former Secret Service officer who was on protective detail during her time as First Lady here at the White House. \xc2\xa0It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be flattering. \xc2\xa0Is there a feeling within the administration about agents writing about their time in protective detail of the First Family, flattering or unflattering?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, listen, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t read much of the publicity about this particular book. \xc2\xa0And I think that the Secret Service obviously has some standards that they maintain, particularly as it relates to protecting details about their policies and procedures. \xc2\xa0But, look, I think I\xe2\x80\x99d reserve judgment about the wisdom of writing a book from such a perspective until I know more about the book.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it appropriate, do you think?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Look, again, from here, I can\xe2\x80\x99t -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t weigh in on whether -- on the propriety of doing something like that.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I want to ask you as well about something you referred to earlier about judicial appointments. \xc2\xa0I think you said the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t willy-nilly decide where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to fill these gaps. \xc2\xa0You mentioned the judicial emergencies, which exist still across the country, dozens of them. \xc2\xa0They did years ago as well when the President decided to fill three positions on the D.C. Circuit. \xc2\xa0At that time, there were bipartisan lawmakers, there were judges on the court who had said their workload was such that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t need additional judges. \xc2\xa0That, of course, led to the nuclear option being issued by --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Deployed.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0-- yeah, deployed by then-Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid. \xc2\xa0So how does that square with your statement about choosing judicial priorities?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, look, I think filling vacancies on the second-highest court in the land I think is a priority that everybody would acknowledge is important. \xc2\xa0But, look, what is true is that there are highly qualified judicial nominees with strong bipartisan support that have been put forward by this President that are being blocked by Republicans in the Senate solely because these individuals were nominated by a Democratic President. \xc2\xa0That is entirely inconsistent with the basic responsibility of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely inconsistent with generally accepted notions of fairness. \xc2\xa0And it is entirely inconsistent with ensuring that we protect our independent judiciary from overt partisan influence; that if we start describing judges as Democratic judges or Republican judges, that undermines the notion that the outcome is determined solely by an impartial consideration of the law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd, look, the President has also acknowledged that there\xe2\x80\x99s no one party that bears exclusive responsibility for politicizing this process. \xc2\xa0But what is also beyond dispute is that Republicans have escalated this dispute when it comes to the Supreme Court and when it comes to the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland. \xc2\xa0Even Senator Lindsey Graham has acknowledged that what Republicans are doing right now is unprecedented. \xc2\xa0And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he meant it in a positive way.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Why not focus where there are these dozens of judicial emergencies? \xc2\xa0If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to say that is the crisis, that\xe2\x80\x99s the issue that has to be handled, then why focus, as you did on the D.C. Circuit or other courts, where that obviously has shifted the balance, many would argue, of that court and certainly the way that it has decided things with regard to this administration?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Listen, I think Republicans would be hard-pressed to make the case that somehow filling vacancies on the second-highest court in the land is not important. \xc2\xa0And the fact is, the President did put forward highly qualified nominees for that job, and those were individuals who, to this day, serve this country with distinction on the second-highest court in the land. \xc2\xa0What is also true is that there are courts that have judicial emergencies in place -- places where a vacancy in a judge\xe2\x80\x99s chambers is having an impact on the ability of the American people to get justice. \xc2\xa0And the President is deeply concerned about that, and the President has appointed well-qualified individuals with bipartisan support to fill those vacancies. \xc2\xa0But Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the United States Senate have blocked those appointees unfairly. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong, and it is inconsistent with the constitutional responsibility of the United States Senate. \xc2\xa0And the President is going to continue to make a strong case that the Senate should act on those nominees, including his nominee in the Supreme Court.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is it accurate to say there was no judicial emergency in the D.C.

EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that. \xc2\xa0We could go and take a look at it. \xc2\xa0You said there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, and I guess what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that whether there is a judicial emergency on the D.C. Circuit or not, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to make the case that filling a vacancy on the second-highest court in the land is somehow something that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a priority. \xc2\xa0The President certainly thinks that it should be.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMike.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick question on tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s visit -- the Indian Prime Minister visit. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that the President\xe2\x80\x99s sort of -- the main deliverable the President is hoping for is a request to get India to quickly ratify the climate change agreement? \xc2\xa0Is that sort of the main thing that he\xe2\x80\x99d like, policy-wise, to come away from? \xc2\xa0And if not, what are the other things that the President is hoping for out of the visit tomorrow?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to say about potential deliverables yet. \xc2\xa0We may have more on this tomorrow, obviously. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that there are a couple of things that the President is interested in discussing with Prime Minister Modi tomorrow. \xc2\xa0The first is, obviously, the important role that India played in completing an international climate change agreement. \xc2\xa0We discussed back in December, in Paris, that India was going to play an important role in making important commitments to this agreement that would ensure that the world came together to confront this challenge. \xc2\xa0And President Obama had an opportunity to meet with Prime Minister Modi and the rest of the Indian delegation to those negotiations to talk over what role India could play and what commitments India could make.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tObviously, this is a situation where Prime Minister Modi demonstrated a lot of leadership, even in the face of a difficult political climate back home. \xc2\xa0He committed his country to standards that will be good for the Indian population, will be good for the Indian people, but more importantly will be -- or just as importantly will be good for the rest of the world, too.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo obviously the President has a lot of respect for the way that Prime Minister Modi has handled this issue, and I would anticipate that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a discussion about what more the United States and India can do to advance the climate agenda. \xc2\xa0I would expect the United States and India to discuss the economic ties between our two countries. \xc2\xa0The economic relationship between the United States and India is an important one, and it is a relationship that benefits both our citizens. \xc2\xa0And so I would anticipate a discussion of some economic issues.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThere are obviously some important national security issues as well. \xc2\xa0And we have seen, in recent years, greater and closer coordination between U.S. national security officials and Indian national security officials. \xc2\xa0And the President is certainly interested in trying to deepen and strengthen those ties because it would enhance the national security of both our countries.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pretty full agenda. \xc2\xa0I recognize that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t discuss it in very much detail, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to do that tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just on the first thing, on the climate thing. \xc2\xa0Is it fair to say that the President is pushing the Prime Minister to have his country ratify the climate change agreement by the end of the year? \xc2\xa0Because that\xe2\x80\x99s the next step, right? \xc2\xa0I mean, you can talk about the leadership that India provided in getting the agreement into place, but the next step is getting all these countries to ratify it so that then it goes into force. \xc2\xa0And there\'s, I think, 55 percent of the country or something have to do that. \xc2\xa0So is that one of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to try to convince -- work hard during this visit to get India to do it?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0What I don\'t know is I don\'t know the process that India has to go through in order to ratify the agreement. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t know whether or not the President will be making that specific request. \xc2\xa0We can discuss that tomorrow. \xc2\xa0But the role that India has played thus far in helping the international community come to an agreement has been significant, and we obviously would expect India, moving forward, to continue to play an important role in the international community in making progress even beyond the agreement that was signed -- that was reached back in December.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And I should probably say Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name just in the question -- (laughter) -- because that\'s one of the required --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Don\'t give into the peer pressure. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.) \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAll right, let\xe2\x80\x99s move around a little bit. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You were talking about how good the President is at campaigning. \xc2\xa0And last week he had a moment when he was trying to take on Donald Trump, and he sort of paused or lost his train of thought. \xc2\xa0I don\'t know if you remember the moment, but --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 MR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I don\'t. \xc2\xa0Can you be more specific?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0At one point, he appeared to go off-script, and there were a lot of news outlets that suggested that Donald Trump was making the President speechless. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see any of those accounts.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You didn\xe2\x80\x99t --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tJohn.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thank you, Josh. \xc2\xa0Two very brief questions on different areas. \xc2\xa0First, when the President was at the G7 Summit, he said that the agreement on Greece that was made at the time resolved the Greek debt issue for a reasonable amount of time. \xc2\xa0Given the fact that that country has debt-to-GDP of 180 percent, what is the timeframe he was referring to? \xc2\xa0And what needs to be done to have a permanent solution to the Greek crisis?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, John, I think what the President was alluding to is just the fact that Greece and the other members of the EU have made important progress in both offering up needed support to the Greek government and to the Greek people as they confront some significant fiscal and economic challenges in their country. \xc2\xa0And what we\'ve seen also from the Greek government is a genuine commitment to implementing some key economic and fiscal reforms that would put Greece back on a path to sustainable debt load. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo this is not a problem that\'s going to get solved overnight, and there have been various points along the way over the last six years or so where it has looked as if the relationship between Greece and the EU might go down the wrong path. \xc2\xa0I think the President was simply observing that as the Greek government continues to successfully implement these reforms, and as the EU continues to keep its commitment to supporting the Greek government, that things seem to be moving in the right direction. \xc2\xa0And, look, the President I think also was offering some credit to leaders across the EU and in Greece for making some decisions that weren\xe2\x80\x99t terribly popular politically, but were critical to addressing this significant challenge that would have consequences for the global economy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of important progress that\'s been made, and the President is certainly pleased with the current trajectory. \xc2\xa0But there are important decisions that lie ahead, and the United States will be there to strongly support our allies and partners in Europe as they confront these significant challenges.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Here on the domestic front, tomorrow California is going to have a primary, and California Democrats are poised for an unprecedented situation. \xc2\xa0All polls indicate that under California\xe2\x80\x99s unique system, the two top vote-getters who will square off in November will both be Democrats, both of whom the President knows very well -- Attorney General Harris and Congresswoman Sanchez. \xc2\xa0How does he make a decision who to support and campaign for in the fall when there\xe2\x80\x99s two members of his own party competing?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think we\'ll wait and see what the results are before we contemplate how the President will confront that rather unique situation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I ask you Wednesday morning?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0You can certainly try. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tByron.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Josh, ABC reported over the weekend that the White House scratched a line from a briefing transcript because reportedly you said it was inaudible. \xc2\xa0I was in that briefing, and I recall the question and it seemed pretty audible to me. \xc2\xa0The video also makes it pretty clear. \xc2\xa0I hear what was being said. \xc2\xa0Is the White House going to restore that line?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, Byron, I think what was true at the time is that there was a little cross-talk. \xc2\xa0And fortunately, your conscientious colleagues at ABC News, recognizing the discrepancy, asked me about it the next day, and I had the opportunity to explain exactly what had occurred, and that\'s what I did.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0You had two instances, both the White House and the State Department scratching things from the public record. \xc2\xa0I understand you\'re acknowledging that there was some cross-talk in the White House situation. \xc2\xa0But both have been about the Iran deal.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I don\'t think it\'s fair for you to say that they were scratched. \xc2\xa0I don\'t think that\'s an accurate --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t transcribed. \xc2\xa0In the State Department case, it was removed. \xc2\xa0Here it was not transcribed. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0So I think it\'s important to note the distinction between what was apparently an effort at the State Department to make a specific decision to remove a portion of the video, and that\'s obviously something that I\'ve said is inconsistent with what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from the whole goal of engaging in a public briefing. \xc2\xa0The situation that you\'re citing is related to a specific issue with a transcript that relates to two words. \xc2\xa0So I don\'t -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be hard-pressed to make the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s a link between the two.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I re-ask you that question just for clarity? \xc2\xa0The question was, \xe2\x80\x9cCan you categorically state that no senior administration official in this administration has ever lied publicly about any aspect of the Iran nuclear deal?\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, let me just state in the affirmative, which is that the administration has made a forceful and fact-based, accurate, truthful case about how the American people and the international community benefit from an international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd what I think is a much more worthy endeavor is to scrutinize the claims of those individuals who criticized the Iran deal falsely. \xc2\xa0There are individuals who suggested that somehow Iran would never agree to this agreement. \xc2\xa0They were wrong. \xc2\xa0There are individuals who said that we would not be able to verify that this agreement was being accurately implemented. \xc2\xa0They were wrong. \xc2\xa0There were individuals who suggested that somehow Iran would never follow through with the commitments that they had made in the context of the Iran deal. \xc2\xa0They were wrong. There are individuals who suggested that immediately Iran would get hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief if this deal went through. \xc2\xa0They were wrong.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think it\'s worthy of spending some time considering exactly whether or not those individuals were just misinformed or lying. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But you\'re unwilling to categorically state that no public officials ever willfully misled on the Iran deal?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Byron, I can categorically say -- I\'m going to say it in the affirmative. \xc2\xa0Unless you want -- you want to present some evidence, or just make a claim?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0I mean, just there was some confusion over this on the question.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Okay. \xc2\xa0Well, let me say one more time, in the affirmative, declaratively, categorically, the administration made a strong, fact-based, truthful case about the benefits of the international agreement to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. \xc2\xa0What we said about the Iran deal and its benefits for the American people have come to pass. \xc2\xa0And that\'s something that this administration is quite proud of, and I think it will be an important part of this President\xe2\x80\x99s legacy. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Shifting focus a little bit, Speaker Ryan started unveiling his plan -- the Republican plan that he\xe2\x80\x99s calling \xe2\x80\x9cA Better Way.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Tomorrow, he\xe2\x80\x99s unveiling his plans -- his specific plans on poverty. \xc2\xa0Is this a potential area for collaboration with the White House? \xc2\xa0Or do things like Zika, Puerto Rico need to be cleared from the desk first before this becomes really part of --\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, no. \xc2\xa0The President had an opportunity to talk about this a little bit in his State of the Union address -- that there is some common ground that could be found when it comes to addressing poverty. \xc2\xa0One of the things that Speaker Ryan has previously indicated his strong support for is expanding eligibility for the earned income tax credit. \xc2\xa0President Obama actually thinks that this is a pretty good idea.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there could be an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to work together to make progress on an objective like that, something that would have a positive, broader economic benefit, but also would do something to fight poverty and, frankly, expand a little economic opportunity for those who are working really hard to get into the middle class.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo there is an opportunity for some overlap. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say, Lana, the thing that -- I just have to, like, characterize myself as bemused by this process -- is that the way that individuals who worked for Mr. Ryan, for Speaker Ryan and other observers of this process sort of treat these policy papers as if they\xe2\x80\x99re, like, written by an academic or something; that somebody is sitting around at a think tank -- somebody who is not involved in government -- as generating all these great ideas that should be -- that merit careful consideration by the United States Congress. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tHe\xe2\x80\x99s the Speaker of the House. \xc2\xa0He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just have to make policy proposals, he runs the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0Put it in a bill. \xc2\xa0Put it on the floor. \xc2\xa0Run it through a committee. \xc2\xa0Have a debate. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole reason you presumably ran for the job in the first place. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s have that debate. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd this is part of what I think the President has noted in the past too. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s eager to have some Republican members of Congress on the other side of the aisle who are actually interested in doing something, who actually want to put forward a proactive agenda. \xc2\xa0And look, I think many of the things that are included in the policy proposal that Speaker Ryan is going to put forward are things that are inconsistent with Democratic priorities. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \xc2\xa0We can have that debate. \xc2\xa0Here\xe2\x80\x99s the good news for Speaker Ryan: \xc2\xa0There is a huge majority of Republicans in the -- Speaker of the House -- or the House of Representatives -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve won a whole bunch of elections all across the country. \xc2\xa0So if his agenda is so good and his party is in charge, then let\xe2\x80\x99s put those ideas into a bill. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a debate. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s pass them through the House of Representatives. \xc2\xa0Let\xe2\x80\x99s engage in something here.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBecause I think the benefit of that is, A, first of all, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to actually stand for something. \xc2\xa0But second of all, maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to find some common ground. \xc2\xa0Put forward a bill that\xe2\x80\x99s got a whole bunch of ideas, including expanding access to the earned income tax credit. \xc2\xa0And maybe we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to pass the big bill, and maybe Speaker Ryan will be disappointed by that, but at least he can get one thing done. \xc2\xa0At least he can have one thing that he can point to that Democrats and Republicans would agree on, that the Democratic President would encourage Democrats in the House to support. \xc2\xa0Because I know there\xe2\x80\x99s some concern that Speaker Ryan must have about protecting his right flank and not angering conservative Republicans.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tBut if you actually want to get something done, why not work with the Democratic President to build strong support in the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis? \xc2\xa0That will send a pretty strong message to the United States Senate that they should act on this too. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s the essence of governing, particularly in an era of divided government. \xc2\xa0But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Republicans, basically, silence when it comes to an agenda. \xc2\xa0And the Speaker of the House, after serving in the job for eight months, finally puts forward some ideas and everybody acts like, oh, well, you know, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- like he works at a think tank or something. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s the Speaker of the House. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s his job to put forward ideas. \xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s also his job to put those ideas on the floor of the House of Representatives and debate them. \xc2\xa0Maybe we can actually turn one or two of them into a law.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What do you think of the title, \xe2\x80\x9cA Better Way?\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) on that too?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I think on that front we would take a look at the individual proposals, and then we can all evaluate whether or not that\xe2\x80\x99s actually true.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Malia\xe2\x80\x99s graduation -- any special plans to celebrate that you can share with us?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0None that I can share. \xc2\xa0But the President I think has spoken publicly about how this is an important moment for him. \xc2\xa0And the President and the First Lady are both quite proud of their daughter, as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tConnie, go ahead.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0This is the anniversary of -- the anniversary of the shooting of Robert F. Kennedy after he won the California primary. \xc2\xa0Do you have any thoughts on the safety of the political candidates?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Any thoughts on what?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The safety of the political candidates. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, obviously, in light of that tragedy, there were a number of reforms that were implemented to extend Secret Service protection to presidential candidates as well. \xc2\xa0And obviously the men and women of the Secret Service take very seriously the responsibility that they have to offer protection to those -- to obviously the President and the First Family, but also to some presidential candidates that are under their protection as well. \xc2\xa0So we obviously owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women of the Secret Service who go to great lengths to protect our candidates, to protect our President, and ultimately to protect our democracy.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0(Inaudible) the country with the floods and fires, can you assure the American people that they\'ll get their compensation in a timely manner -- those that have been affected by floods and fires?\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you\'re referring to a specific incident. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Texas -- \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0Well, I know that there\'s been some high-profile flooding in Texas, and I\'m not aware of any specific requests that have been made by the Texas governor, but we can certainly check to see if there\'s any federal assistance that\'s been requested in that instance. \xc2\xa0But that does remind me that there is the potential for Tropical Storm Colin to make landfall in Florida later today. \xc2\xa0I can tell you that the President was briefed on preparations in advance of Tropical Storm Colin early this morning by Lisa Monaco, the President\'s top Homeland Security advisor. \xc2\xa0You can get some more details from FEMA, but they\'ve already deployed a liaison to the State Emergency Operation Center in Florida to ensure a well-integrated, seamless response to this storm. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAs usual, we strongly encourage people who are potentially in affected areas to monitor weather reports and to listen closely to the instructions that are given by state and local officials. \xc2\xa0Those are instructions that will be given with the safety of these individuals in mind. \xc2\xa0And we encourage people to follow those instructions.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThis particular storm does have the potential to lead to some pretty significant flooding. \xc2\xa0And we want everybody to be conscientious about listening to instructions and directions that they\'ve received that are necessary to keep them safe.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDave, I\'ll give you the last one.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Josh. \xc2\xa0This is kind of a long windup, so bear with me. \xc2\xa0When you were talking about the President being so good at explaining what\'s at stake in the campaign and how much he enjoys it, it brought to mind that four years ago he used to refer to Bill Clinton as the "Secretary of Explaining Stuff" on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0And you also made the comment earlier about the fact that President Obama is, for the last generation, the only President at the end of his second term who is in demand on a campaign trail. \xc2\xa0Of course, that makes me think about the Lewinski affair and why President Clinton wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite so popular at the end of his second term.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd the difference between four years ago, when Bill Clinton was "Secretary of Explaining Stuff," and this year seems to be that Donald Trump is eager -- willing, if not eager to go after the Clintons\' past marital difficulties in the context of who\'s better for women, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. \xc2\xa0So my question after all this is, is the White House or the President at all concerned that Trump\'s line of attack against the Clintons\' marriage might make Bill Clinton less effective at explaining stuff is here on the campaign trail?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR. EARNEST: \xc2\xa0No. \xc2\xa0What continues to be true is that President Clinton, I would expect, will be a very powerful and effective advocate for his wife on the campaign trail. \xc2\xa0President Clinton certainly made a forceful case for President Obama\'s reelection four years ago. \xc2\xa0And I would expect that he will play a similarly persuasive and important role for his wife in this campaign, too. \xc2\xa0After all, there are -- I guess this is why it\'s important: \xc2\xa0Sitting in the Oval Office and being the Commander-in-Chief of the United States is a weighty responsibility. \xc2\xa0And there are only a handful of individuals who are still alive who have been charged with that responsibility. \xc2\xa0And I\'m not aware that any of them, even the Republicans, have indicated that they\'re prepared to support the Republican nominee. \xc2\xa0And I think that\'s an indication of how seriously those men -- it\'s only men that have held the job so far -- believe that temperament and judgement are when choosing the next President of the United States. \xc2\xa0But I\'m confident that President Clinton will be out on the campaign trail, strongly supporting his wife. \xc2\xa0And his own personal experience in the job will be part of what makes him such a persuasive advocate for her.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThanks, everybody. \xc2\xa0We\'ll see you tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Did you say Secretary Clinton will be the nominee?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tMR.
