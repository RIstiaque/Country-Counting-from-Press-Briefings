EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your daily briefing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be back here, although not quite as nice as traveling around the country as we did the first three days of this week, as those of you who joined us know.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very successful trip, where the President was able to make announcements on some of the executive actions he can take, things that he can do to move this economy forward, assist students with their student debt, with their loans, and homeowners who are struggling with refinancing their homes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any announcements to make, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Feller.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Two topics today.\xc2\xa0 On the statement we just got from the President about the European deal, does the White House feel that this agreement, if implemented, is enough to prevent countries around the world from plunging into a recession?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ben, what we have said and the President has said -- Secretary Geithner as well -- is that we believe the Europeans have the capacity to deal with this challenge.\xc2\xa0 We welcome the decisions that were made last night by the European Union, which lay a critical foundation for a comprehensive, conclusive solution, the kind of solution that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been urging them to make.\xc2\xa0 And we will -- we look forward to the full development and implementation of that plan, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with our counterparts there.\xc2\xa0 This is an important, obviously, part of the world, and with very important impacts on the American economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we look forward to working with our counterparts.\xc2\xa0 We look forward to the full and rapid implementation of that plan.\xc2\xa0 And we all need to work individually and collectively, as nations and allies and partners, to take the necessary measures to sustain our -- sustain the global recovery and to put our people back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of the fear of recession across the globe, how significant is this in preventing that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict into the future, but it is clearly important that Europe take these actions.\xc2\xa0 It has been important for -- and obvious, I think, for a number of months -- that this is a challenge that needed to be addressed.\xc2\xa0 And we have been working with our counterparts to -- as they have dealt with this.\xc2\xa0 And the decisions made last night were very important, and they lay the foundation for the kind of decisive, conclusive resolution to these challenges that need to happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics, quickly, to the super committee.\xc2\xa0 Senate Democrats have put out a plan that includes cuts to Medicare and Social Security benefits.\xc2\xa0 Is that the kind of the thing the President could endorse?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific comment about a plan that -- which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think has been put out but has been talked about.\xc2\xa0 What we believe is that the committee needs to act.\xc2\xa0 It has been assigned a goal by the Congress through the Budget Control Act that was signed into law by the President.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a plan that represents the sort of balanced approach that he believes is essential to addressing our mid- and long-term deficit challenge and debt challenge.\xc2\xa0 And he hopes that the Congress will take that up, and move forward in a way that ensures that everybody gets a fair shake, that\xe2\x80\x99s there\xe2\x80\x99s a -- they share in both the prosperity and in the burden here, as we deal with our long-term deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I think I can say, broadly speaking, is that what isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right answer is to rule out entirely, to take off the table revenues -- because there is no credible account of -- or assessment of the kind of action that we need to take that does not include a balanced approach, that does not include revenues.\xc2\xa0 And to say the burden here should be borne entirely by the middle class, or by those struggling in America, while the wealthiest among us have to contribute nothing is simply out of sync, not just with the President\xe2\x80\x99s view, not just with Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 view, but independents and Republicans everywhere except in Washington.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President, as I said, has put forward a plan, and he looks forward to the super committee and Congress in general at taking action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One last point.\xc2\xa0 One of the ideas being kicked around about the super committee is that that late November deadline for action lacks teeth because the cuts wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kick in until 2013.\xc2\xa0 So, in effect, this process could evaporate this fall and winter, and nothing will happen.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House view that deadline as \xe2\x80\x9clacking teeth\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 This is something that Congress has assigned to itself, and they need to act on it.\xc2\xa0 The trigger mechanism that you talk about, the sequestration, is onerous for a reason.\xc2\xa0 And it is, I think, creates the kind of pressure on Congress to act that is necessary. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, the President\xe2\x80\x99s view is clear.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a detailed proposal that makes clear where he thinks Congress ought to go, makes clear that a balanced approach is the way to go, which reflects the approach that the American people believe we ought to take.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into too much detail about the negotiations at the committee level or at the congressional level.\xc2\xa0 The President clearly believes that there\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of complexity or confusion about what needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 It requires tough choices, but it requires tough choices by all sides.\xc2\xa0 And if there\xe2\x80\x99s a willingness to approach this with a view towards balance, then it really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that difficult.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has repeatedly said that there are headwinds that come from the eurozone debt crisis that have slowed the U.S. economic recovery.\xc2\xa0 Does this deal diminish that risk that it could derail that recovery entirely?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We need to do everything we can here in the United States to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 That is the principal focus that the President has.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what he has been talking about and acting on consistently and what you will continue to see him talk about and act on.\xc2\xa0 We need to control the things that we can control. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As far as Europe goes, we have been working with our counterparts as they address that challenge, and making clear that we believe that it\xe2\x80\x99s significant and needs to be dealt with.\xc2\xa0 And we are certainly encouraged by the important decisions that were made and look forward to working with the Europeans as they take conclusive action to deal with this -- because, as I said before, this is a very vital part of the world economically.\xc2\xa0 It has an impact on the global economy and directly on the American economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s statement calls for rapid implementation --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s right.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- but there are experts saying that this could take weeks, if not months, to fully implement -- get the details pinned down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will continue to encourage and work with our counterparts to help them move forward towards rapid and complete implementation. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just, as I promised here to move around in the back.\xc2\xa0 Nobody -- (laughter) -- Mr. Sitov.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Our foreign minister raised a couple of interesting points in a recent interview.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about them.\xc2\xa0 Point one was if Americans care very much about international authorization when they go in a country like Afghanistan -- or Iraq, by the way -- even though he was speaking about Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 They need to care about reporting to the international community when they are planning to get out.\xc2\xa0 So my question I guess is do you plan to make a report to the United Nations and make sure that the job is done before you leave Afghanistan?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about what the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy is and strategy is in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He laid it out in great detail.\xc2\xa0 And as I think he has proven with regard to Iraq, with regard to Afghanistan, with regard to going after the senior leadership in al Qaeda, he says what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do and he does it.\xc2\xa0 So he will keep his commitments, and those commitments include the drawdown of the surge forces in Afghanistan that is happening now and the continued drawdown that will then, by the end of \xe2\x80\x9814, allow for the transfer of security lead to Afghan security forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s all been very transparent and will continue to be as we move forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will we be assured that the flow of drugs from Afghanistan, which is the biggest problem for my country, that the Afghans themselves will be able to handle that situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Andrei, what I can say more broadly is that we are working towards a situation in Afghanistan where the Afghan security forces can, with increasing capability, take over the security lead in their country.\xc2\xa0 Now that\xe2\x80\x99s -- the timeline there takes us through the end of 2014.\xc2\xa0 And I think security can be construed broadly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As you saw in Iraq, there was a gradual ceding of security control and lead to the Iraq security forces.\xc2\xa0 That process occurred over a sustained period of time and was very successful, we believe.\xc2\xa0 And while obviously each country is different, in this case, and the circumstances are different, and the timelines are different, we anticipate that we will be able to keep the schedule outlined by the President and keep our commitments, and keep both the American people and the international community apprised of the progress we\xe2\x80\x99re making and our plans for drawing down.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me move on.\xc2\xa0 Michael.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President seen the footage from Oakland this week of violence between protesters and the police?\xc2\xa0 And is there a concern in the White House or from the President that these Occupy protests become -- lead to violence in some way in the coming months?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that he\xe2\x80\x99s seen that specific footage.\xc2\xa0 He certainly is aware of the news in general and there are TVs on around here and when we travel.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We, as the President has said, understand the frustrations that have led to these demonstrations.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of concern out there about our sluggish economy, the need for it to grow faster, the fact that our unemployment rate is much too high.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is also a lot of concern about the perception that Wall Street, writ large here, acted in a way that helped precipitate the worst financial crisis and worst economic crisis that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen since the Great Depression, and now, after we have passed into law and signed into law reforms that would both protect American consumers, in their dealings with financial institutions, and would ensure that the kinds of reckless actions that were taken could not be taken again, we see a lot of efforts in Congress from Republicans as well as by lobbyists for Wall Street to try to undo those reforms; to stop, for example, the confirmation of our nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Board -- our consumer watchdog.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As to the violence, we obviously believe and insist that everyone behave in a lawful manner, even as they\xe2\x80\x99re expressing, justifiably, their frustrations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, sort of to follow on that, obviously the most graphic images we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen have come from Oakland, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of cities where leaders are becoming frustrated with the movements -- and not because of violence, but because of sort of the persistent nature of it and how it sort of disrupts I guess business and that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk of getting rid of -- pardon me, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk of sort of cracking down arrests, that kind of thing.\xc2\xa0 Does the President think that\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate, or does he see that as putting a limit on expression?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that discussion with the President.\xc2\xa0 I think, again, I would just go back to what I said to Michael.\xc2\xa0 We understand the frustrations that are being expressed, specifically with regard to the need to make sure that Main Street and Wall Street operate by the same set of rules, and the general frustration with the need for jobs and economic growth that creates opportunity for middle-class Americans.\xc2\xa0 And certainly we have a long and noble tradition of free expression and free speech in this country. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We also -- it\xe2\x80\x99s also important that laws are upheld and obeyed.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s a broad view.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a discussion about specific cities or instances with the President.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But aside from lawlessness, just assembling and obviously in the sheer numbers that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing, it certainly gets --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, without getting into specific decisions by municipalities, city councils, mayors, I would simply say that there is a long and noble tradition in the United States of free expression and free speech.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a letter expressing concerns about what they call the family penalty division of the health care law -- provisions that exclude families with children from subsidized exchange coverage, even when they lack affordable employer-based coverage.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the White House reviewing this part of the health care law, looking into ways to fix it or tweak it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I confess that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an answer to you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard vaguely about this, but I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked into it.\xc2\xa0 Maybe HHS can help you more, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner gave an interview earlier today to Laura Ingraham in which he expressed -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just quote him:\xc2\xa0 He said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to just go around Congress is almost laughable.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re keeping a very close eye on the administration to make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re following the law and following the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got great concerns that he may be violating parameters in terms of the executive actions that the President is taking.\xc2\xa0 And our committees of jurisdiction are looking at these proposals to make sure the President isn\xe2\x80\x99t exceeding his authority.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have any response to the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President is operating well within the balance of his authority, and in a way that is consistent with the kinds of executive actions that presidents have taken in previous administrations, presidents of both parties. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would respectfully suggest to the Speaker that perhaps he should and the House should focus on what the American people are insisting that Washington in general focus on, which is the need to grow the economy and create jobs.\xc2\xa0 I think yesterday the House, amidst the demand that action be taken on jobs and the economy, bravely went forward and passed legislation or passed a bill that would issue commemorative coins for baseball, Hall of Fame; it passed overwhelmingly.\xc2\xa0 And now I think they\xe2\x80\x99re pretty much done for the week in a couple of hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a jobs plan filled with measures that have enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, paid for in a way that is supported broadly by the American people, by Democrats, independents and Republicans everywhere except in Congress.\xc2\xa0 He I think believes Congress should act on that.\xc2\xa0 Because with regard to the executive actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, as I know you know, that we do not believe for a moment that they are a substitute for legislative action.\xc2\xa0 What they represent is the President\xe2\x80\x99s absolute commitment to doing everything he can within his authority to assist Americans as they deal with this difficult economy -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s students, helping them consolidate and reduce their debt burden; helping homeowners who are struggling and underwater with their mortgages but paying their bills, helping them refinance their loans so they can take advantage of these historically low loan rates, mortgage rates.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything he can, and you will hear from him and see him continue to take up that cause through executive actions, even as he says to Congress:\xc2\xa0 Pass this bill.\xc2\xa0 Pass the elements of this bill.\xc2\xa0 Do things that grow the economy and create jobs. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess sort of two things.\xc2\xa0 One, the majority in the House of Representatives, they say they have passed anywhere between 15 and 20 bills that would have a positive impact on job growth, and the bills have not been taken up by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 Do you oppose -- I mean, I understand that you oppose the ones that deregulate and some of the others, but do you oppose every single one of them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know every -- I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked at all 15.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is the ones -- the actions that the Congress has taken that help economic growth and job creation, like the free trade agreements, like patent reform, are things that the President agrees with and has signed into law, or put a signature to in terms of the free trade agreements.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I believe the House did today pass a provision, the so-called 3 percent withholding for government contractors provision today, that this President supported.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it was part of the Recovery Act.\xc2\xa0 It is removing from law -- if it gets through the entire Congress -- would remove from the law a provision that was passed under the previous administration, and voted for by Republicans, including the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader.\xc2\xa0 The President has been for this repeal and would certainly look forward to signing that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he is working cooperatively with Republicans on the things that they agree on.\xc2\xa0 I would simply, rather than take my assessment of what their jobs proposals are, just look at what independent economists say about their plans.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s just -- there is no one out there who will say that he -- they may say that there are good policy ideas in those proposals -- policy ideas for the medium and long term -- but there are no ideas, or very few ideas, that have any measurable, positive impact in the near term on economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not just me saying it, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a partisan position, that\xe2\x80\x99s outside economic analysts -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of proposals they\xe2\x80\x99ve put forward. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t deal with the need right now, which is boosting aggregate demand, to use economist lingo, to get the economy growing and to get people back to work.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s plan does that.\xc2\xa0 The President also has a plan which deals with medium- and long-term deficit and debt reduction, and laying a foundation for future economic growth.\xc2\xa0 You got to do all of it.\xc2\xa0 You got to do it all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But your bill keeps coming up, first in the whole and now in different bite-size chunks, as the President put it, and it keeps failing. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it keeps being blocked in unison by Republicans in -- and here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Democrats.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Democrats aren\xe2\x80\x99t voting to block it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ninety-five to 97 percent of Democrats have voted for the American --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying, a bipartisan vote to block it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that is what the Republicans say, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 But when 100 percent of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, no.\xc2\xa0 But listen --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- bipartisan vote to block it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I allow that 2 to 5 percent of Democrats have voted against this, whereas 95 to 97 percent have voted for the jobs bill in its entirety and the single provision that\xe2\x80\x99s been voted on it so far.\xc2\xa0 And 100 percent, in lockstep, of Republicans have voted to block it.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the Senate rules that pertain now, where everything -- even if it\xe2\x80\x99s naming a post office -- practically needs a filibuster-proof majority, we would only need 50 or 51 to turn these things that are broadly supported by the American people into law. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But they\xe2\x80\x99re blocked by the Republicans -- blocked based on a principle in the Senate that was established by the Senate Republican Leader, quite a long time ago, quite explicitly, quite publicly, that his number-one priority as the Republican leader in the Senate, in the United States Congress, was not to create jobs, not to assist the American people, not to grow the economy, but to do everything he could to ensure that Barack Obama was not reelected.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be the agenda that the American people support.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would just point out that when you see this 100 percent Republican opposition, it\xe2\x80\x99s totally disconnected from Republicans out in the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Democrats out there and the President.\xc2\xa0 Look, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the data, probably ABC\xe2\x80\x99s own poll.\xc2\xa0 I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s -- they\xe2\x80\x99re out of sync with Democrats, independents, Republicans -- Americans who want Washington to act, want Washington to take common-sense measures that would help grow the economy and put people back to work -- and want them paid for so they don\xe2\x80\x99t add a dime to the deficit, and paid for in a way that this President has put forward.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So does what you say mean that the President has decided that there is no way to work with the Republicans --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- and that therefore, it\xe2\x80\x99s important for him to take his case campaign-style to people in states which are going to be critical for his reelection?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I know it sticks in your craw that the President actually leaves Washington and goes out and talks to the American people --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the President believes very strongly that Republicans in Congress will not take action because he asks them to.\xc2\xa0 I think that has been established over these nearly three years.\xc2\xa0 What he does also believe is that Republicans in Congress will take action if their constituents demand that they do it.\xc2\xa0 So that is why he is out in the country talking about the need to pass the jobs act, and why he is talking about the actions that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking, without Congress, because we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Congress to act -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s student loans or refinancing mortgages or other things that he\xe2\x80\x99s done -- waivers for No Child Left Behind, or more than a billion dollars of savings through lessening regulations for hospitals and doctors.\xc2\xa0 He will continue to do these things, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to press Congress to take action.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But, again, you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard him out there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re being quite transparent, calling on the American people to call on Congress to do the things that the American people say they want done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but perhaps you would allow that the places he chooses to make this case have some bearing on his reelection.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, I think he has been around the country, including to places that are blue and purple and red, making this case.\xc2\xa0 And he will continue to move around the country to states of all colors making his case.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Just kind of staying on this topic.\xc2\xa0 Do you know when the last time the President spoke to the Speaker was?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to find it for you.\xc2\xa0 I think we publicly discussed it or read it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it when the Speaker reminded the President that they did have a jobs bill?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 Again, Sam, we read it out.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he\xe2\x80\x99s talked to him since then.\xc2\xa0 The conversation I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of is the one that we read out, I think I did read out from here.\xc2\xa0 This is the one where the President I think called to thank the Speaker for his work in getting the free trade agreements passed.\xc2\xa0 And then, yes, I believe the Speaker brought up the fact that they have put forward proposals that they label jobs proposals.\xc2\xa0 And we make the point that economists disagree in terms of the job creation potential in the near term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Henry.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So then, following up on that phone call they had.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot of follow-ups. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Following on a follow, the President has made his case around the country; you seem to believe there is bipartisan support for this jobs bill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a statement of opinion, it\xe2\x80\x99s a statement of fact if you believe the data.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So you have that data in hand.\xc2\xa0 Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President call the Speaker and other leaders, Democratic leaders, as well over here after weeks of back and forth and just say, how are we going to get this done?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because there is no complexity here to how we get it done.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to act.\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to -- I mean, why -- the House won\xe2\x80\x99t even take up the provisions of the Americans Jobs Act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he call and say, stop passing bills to help baseball coins -- they\xe2\x80\x99re already done.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a constituency that barely exceeds the number of people in this room that believes that the President and members of Congress need to hole up in a room together to work out what they should be doing for the American people.\xc2\xa0 It is eminent --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But him traveling and John Boehner going on the Laura Ingraham show is not moving the ball forward, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t appear.\xc2\xa0 So --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I disagree.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think the Speaker would say that they passed this 3 percent withholding provision, which, again, was part of the Recovery Act -- part of the jobs act, something the President supports.\xc2\xa0 Congress passed the free trade agreements, patent reform.\xc2\xa0 We will have votes on every provision within the American Jobs Act, giving Republicans the opportunity in the Senate and, hopefully if they see the light in the House, an opportunity to vote on those.\xc2\xa0 So we remain hopeful that Congress will act, and we note where it has acted.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 You haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a chance yet to comment on the GDP numbers.\xc2\xa0 A few weeks ago the President had an interview with George Stephanopoulos and said no, the American people are not better off now than they were a few years ago, but we\xe2\x80\x99re working to try to fix that. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You get good GDP numbers today.\xc2\xa0 Is that a step forward and suggest to you that is turning around?\xc2\xa0 Or is the ultimate number just unemployment, regardless of GDP?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 2.5 percent growth may be better than it was the previous quarter, but it is not good enough.\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not good enough.\xc2\xa0 We all speak enough, I think, frequently with economists to know that 2.5 percent growth does not -- while it is positive -- is not enough to significantly affect employment.\xc2\xa0 We need to take action to ensure that the economy grows faster, and that more -- to ensure that more people get on the job and go back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact is, without the American Jobs Act, if Congress does not pass any provision within the American Jobs Act, the economic prognosis for next year is growth that is too slow to bring down unemployment.\xc2\xa0 Now, maybe some in Congress think that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 I sure know, we know, that the American people -- left, right and center -- do not think that\xe2\x80\x99s okay.\xc2\xa0 That is why the President believes so strongly that we have to pass the jobs act, because outside economists say it would add up to 2 percent to our GDP.\xc2\xa0 Add that 2 percent to what might happen otherwise and you would get hopefully the kind of economic growth that could bring down the unemployment rate.\xc2\xa0 And is there any higher priority?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have 50 votes for the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 There were Democrats that voted --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We had 51.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For cloture.\xc2\xa0 But there were Democrats that voted --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it further because the Republicans blocked it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there were Democrats that voted for cloture, like Webb and Lieberman, who said that they were going to vote for cloture but not for the final bill.\xc2\xa0 There were not a majority of senators for the jobs act.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, first of all, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that far.\xc2\xa0 Had it gotten that far, I am -- we are absolutely confident that a majority -- the majority of the United States Senate would support the American Jobs Act as a broad majority of the American people support it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to the essential question here.\xc2\xa0 Despite the President\xe2\x80\x99s best efforts in 2008, voters saw fit to send Republicans to the majority in the House and make John Boehner the Speaker of the House.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 2010, you mean.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2010, right.\xc2\xa0 The President sent up legislation; that same House did not see fit to pass it as one piece of legislation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In fact, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t even vote on it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 What give the President the right to do this by executive order?\xc2\xa0 Why not --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think -- Mike, he can --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, in all the things --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Where are you confused by -- he\xe2\x80\x99s not passing the American Jobs Act by executive --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s breaking out component parts, is he not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 The executive actions are not pieces of the American Jobs Act.\xc2\xa0 The pieces of American Jobs Act are in legislative form because they require congressional action.\xc2\xa0 The things he is doing administratively through executive powers are things that he can do -- the things that do not require legislative action -- so he is exercising that power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, what took him so long?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He has been exercising his executive authority throughout his presidency to help the economy, to help Americans.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact is, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s getting more prominence now because of the obvious-to-everyone dysfunctionality of the Congress; the obstructionism that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the face of what is clearly the number-one priority of the American people -- again, Americans left, right and center.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken from this podium even since I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this job about executive actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, including prior to the refinancing announcement on Monday, the actions he took through executive authority to provide forbearance for the unemployed, to give them a better chance of staying in their homes and paying their mortgages. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he will -- he has done, and will continue to take the kinds of actions he can, as President, without Congress, to help Americans, to help them deal with this economy, to help them deal with their debt, deal with their mortgages, through a variety of other measures that he has taken and will take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And finally, when the new chief of staff came here -- I guess it was six or seven months ago -- he walked with the President across Lafayette Park to the Chamber of Commerce in an effort to mend fences, to sort of demonstrate that he was rolling back some regulations, unshackling business to help them in their efforts to get through the recession.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Six months later, the Occupy Wall Street crowd walked up from Freedom Plaza, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t there to mend fences, they were there to lay siege to the place.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- I mean, given these two contrasting images, is there any concern on your part that goals of Occupy Wall Street run counter to the goals of the administration in terms of your attitudes towards business and deregulation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to fashion an answer that takes into account all the pieces of that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President remains committed to taking the kinds of actions that lessen the regulatory burden where it is appropriate to do so.\xc2\xa0 As I just pointed out in my recitation of actions that he has taken administratively prior to this most recent several announcements, we have, through regulatory relief, initiated action that will save more than a billion dollars for hospitals and doctors, announced by HHS.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would also point -- again, just starting with the first part -- point that I read a report recently in the last couple of days that, despite what you might hear from some folks, President Obama has actually issued fewer regulations than President Bush 43 at this stage in his presidency, and that the overall \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d of those regulations is less than under President Bush.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Having said that, it is the fundamental mission of this President to lift up, secure -- help secure and give opportunity to the middle class of this country.\xc2\xa0 And the frustrations you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing expressed broadly by the American people, as well as through these demonstrations, are frustrations that he absolutely understands, because they go right to the heart of the problem we\xe2\x80\x99re facing, which is economic growth that is too slow and unemployment that is too high.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Above all else, his priority is to address those problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on jobs.\xc2\xa0 One of the most important issues facing organized labor these days is issue number two on the ballot on Ohio, comes up November 8th.\xc2\xa0 A yes vote would affirm John Kasich\xe2\x80\x99s plan to gut collective bargaining; a no vote, which the unions want, would repeal it.\xc2\xa0 Has the President taken a position on issue two?\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to?\xc2\xa0 And does he plan to go to Ohio to speak about it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any travel announcements to make.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific response on the ballot question.\xc2\xa0 I do know that this President strongly supports collective bargaining rights, and you heard him take that position earlier this year with regards to what was going on in Wisconsin.*<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I can take the question as it pertains to the Ohio ballot initiative.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That would seem to lead to a no on issue two?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You could make the announcement now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair analysis, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, does the tone of the statement that you all put out about the resolution of this -- or attempt to resolve this Greek debt crisis reflect the tone that the President is going to take to the G20 meeting next week?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Especially the part where he calls for the rapid implementation, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve noted in so many of your answers today, and previously he and Congress haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to implement any kind of progress on his efforts and theirs, what kind of a position is he going to be in to lecture the Europeans or to ask them to take specific actions that he thinks are right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question that -- Peter, that enough has not been done.\xc2\xa0 That is why you see and hear the President talk so passionately about the need to take action on economic growth and jobs, and the need to deal with our medium- and long-term fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward proposals for the short, medium and long term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I would go back to part of your question and take issue with the idea that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t succeeded at all with regards to some of these issues.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact is the Recovery Act prevented a second Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 It has -- it did lead to the cessation of economic contraction and a sustained period now of economic growth, albeit too slow.\xc2\xa0 And it has led to 2.5 million private sector jobs being created.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, not enough, but some progress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, working with Congress, this President has on several occasions, most recently through the Budget Control Act, taken action to cut costs, cut spending, reduce our deficits and deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 Again, not enough, which is why the President put forward a plan that is far bolder than the minimum requirement that the super committee is operating under.\xc2\xa0 But there has been some action taken with regard to this with Congress.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the President\xe2\x80\x99s message to the Europeans and broadly to all the members of the G20 is that we need to work individually as countries and collectively together to ensure that we sustain and continue the global economic recovery and to put our people, broadly speaking, back to work.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So to what extent does he go there in any kind of a position of strength given the gridlock that is currently underway?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think I took issue with the idea that while there is gridlock on jobs, we remain hopeful that that will change.\xc2\xa0 And there is gridlock thus far on the current mission of the super committee, we are told or we hear, but those deadlines haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet come to pass, that we believe there\xe2\x80\x99s possibility that Congress will act and take up a balanced approach to long-term and medium-term deficit and debt reduction.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he carries with him to France the fact that we are pushing our Congress to act on these matters, and he comes as the leader of the largest economy in the world and a great friend and ally of a great many nations, so I think we continue to have a significant leading role to play at the G20 and other international fora.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could just stay on that real quick, it says, \xe2\x80\x9clook forward to the full development,\xe2\x80\x9d does the -- of the plan -- the White House feel like it has enough details of what they actually agreed to?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these are significant, important decisions that were made, and we look forward to sort of the full development of them and then the rapid implementation of them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But in terms of the flow of information, do you guys have a good sense of what was agreed to there?\xc2\xa0 Are you hungry for more details?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with the fact that we have good communication with our friends and allies and partners in Europe, but I would suggest you ask the Treasury Department about more detailed communications that might be going on.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I spoke with Harry Reid\xe2\x80\x99s office yesterday, who said they have no indication from Senate Republicans that the infrastructure bill taken from the President\xe2\x80\x99s jobs act, possibly up for a vote next week -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve received no indications that they would be in favor of it.\xc2\xa0 As this point, especially as the President moves forward on executive orders, are these votes just symbolic?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the point now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will go back to some of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said before:\xc2\xa0 These are provisions, broadly and specifically with regards to infrastructure, that Republicans have traditionally supported broadly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republicans who vote against it will have to explain to their constituents why they used to be for it and now they\xe2\x80\x99re against it.\xc2\xa0 And are they against it because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think millionaires and billionaires ought to pay a little bit more to help put people back to work?\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough argument to make.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not up to the President -- he does not believe that simply by asking Republicans to do this that they will do it.\xc2\xa0 He is certainly wise enough to understand that that will not be the case. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What he does hope and believe is that senators and members of the House will hear enough from their constituents and get enough pressure from their constituents to take action that that uniform resistance will break down.\xc2\xa0 So we remain hopeful.\xc2\xa0 We are a week, at least I believe, away from a vote on infrastructure and maybe the outlook will change.\xc2\xa0 After all, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a majority -- or we\xe2\x80\x99ll get the 50 or 51.\xc2\xa0 If a few Republicans see the light and decide that it is actually worth asking millionaires and billionaires to pay a little bit more to put construction workers back on the job rebuilding our schools and highways and bridges, which in and of itself is a good thing, but also helps create the kind of foundation that we need for further economic growth in the 21st century, then maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to 60 and maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll actually pass that measure.\xc2\xa0 Then we move on to the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, Republicans will agree to something here because there is no more urgent priority.\xc2\xa0 I confess I was a little surprised to hear from some Republicans -- not in Congress but some Republicans -- that they don\xe2\x80\x99t support extension of the payroll tax cut.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re for protecting tax breaks for millionaires, but they\xe2\x80\x99re also for raising taxes on the middle class?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a new and novel position and probably unsustainable with their constituents.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is a threat of a double-dip recession over with the GDP numbers this morning?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m the wrong guy to ask in terms of economic analysis of that kind.\xc2\xa0 What we know is what I said earlier when I was asked about the GDP numbers is that 2.5 percent is better than we had in the previous quarter and the quarter before that, but it is not good enough by a long shot.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to take action to further boost growth and job creation because I know enough about economics to know that 2.5 percent is not enough to bring down the unemployment rate in any sustained way, and we need to take action to put people back to work.\xc2\xa0 So we need more than 2.5 percent growth.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Paula.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the House Ways and Means Committee came out with an international tax reform proposal, and supporters say it would actually result in creating jobs at home, but opponents say it would actually encourage multinationals to shift jobs overseas.\xc2\xa0 So what is the White House position?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to take that question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with -- you say it\xe2\x80\x99s a bill that\xe2\x80\x99s been put forward?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Camp -- Camp put it out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Syria, number one, very quickly.\xc2\xa0 Has the President met with Ambassador Ford, assuming he\xe2\x80\x99s still here?\xc2\xa0 Are there plans for him to meet with Ambassador Ford?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President was out of town the last three days.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plans to meet him, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll check on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly on Iran.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton in a broadcast interview this week said that there seems to be a move in Iran towards a more military takeover, in effect, inside Iran.\xc2\xa0 I know the President had some comments about the Saudi plot at the press conference.\xc2\xa0 But is that a description that he would comfortably use to describe the political situation in Iran?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Rather than adopt that language I would simply say that the leadership in Iran is hypocritical with regards to the Arab Spring and has consistently taken actions that do not suggest that they will fulfill their international obligations.\xc2\xa0 And we are very mindful of that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Alexis, and then Jackie, and then Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I just want to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, Alexis, Chris, Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to clarify to understand.\xc2\xa0 The President has been talking about the jobs act for about six weeks and been out there around the country.\xc2\xa0 I just want to make sure I understand, you all believe there is evidence that going out there and providing pressure from the outside in is showing some results among the electorate? \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, here\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to make sure what --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 I think so.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been polls that demonstrate that pretty significantly.\xc2\xa0 I think another poll that shows how out of sync Republicans in Congress are with the mainstream is the recent one that showed a historic low -- 9 percent approval rating for Congress.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I know nine is a popular number in the Republican Party, but this can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be -- (laughter) -- the kind of nine that they want.\xc2\xa0 Nine, nine, nine, nine.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I think at some point -- we think at some point, we certainly hope that the pressure that is mounting up there, out there, will be felt by members of Congress who seem to be content to deal with commemorative coins for Hall of Fame baseball players, which is something I support, but not ahead of creating jobs or growing the economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So yes, we believe there is progress being made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what is the risk, in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view?\xc2\xa0 What is the risk to those Republicans if they are ignoring what you believe is very evident?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They have to answer to their constituents.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re here because they were elected to serve the people in their districts and states.\xc2\xa0 And, again, you only have to look at what those people are saying all around the country to know that there is great dissatisfaction with the dysfunctionality in Congress, with the failure of Congress to address the concerns that the American people have. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that kind of pressure, from the grassroots up, is the kind of pressure that usually gets Congress to act.\xc2\xa0 Hopefully it will be so this time.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chris.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Amid all this talk about jobs, LGBT Americans are particularly concerned about their own job security because of the lack of federal nondiscrimination protections.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s currently legal to -- perfectly legal to fire someone for being gay in 29 states, and fire someone for being transgender in 35 states.\xc2\xa0 The President has endorsed legislation that will institute federal nondiscrimination protections, but does the administration see this problem as part of the larger jobs issue?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, you mention what the President has endorsed, and his -- he believes that the LGBT community should absolutely not be discriminated against with regards to jobs or anything else.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the -- but there is a broad problem that affects all Americans, and that is 9.1 percent unemployment and 2.5 percent GDP growth, which is good but not nearly good enough.\xc2\xa0 So he is focused on doing what he can to take measures that will help the economy grow and create jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If the President thinks this is a problem, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t this issue addressed as part of the American Jobs Act?\xc2\xa0 Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t he talking about this problem as he makes a case about jobs around the country?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is out there making the case about jobs broadly every day -- much, apparently, to the annoyance of some folks in Congress, but he will keep doing it.\xc2\xa0 And he will keep doing it unless and until every American who\xe2\x80\x99s looking for a job gets one.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to hear him talking about it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jackie.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.\xc2\xa0 Jackie.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you describe how the President gets his information about the Occupy wherever movement?\xc2\xa0 Has it become institutionalized as a part of any briefing as it\xe2\x80\x99s spread?\xc2\xa0 Are there people designated to sort of stay on top of it, to try to talk to people associated with it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That last part -- not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 And the President gets his information about it through you.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he -- there\xe2\x80\x99s substantial coverage about it, and the President -- sorry to the folks in the front row -- doesn\xe2\x80\x99t watch a lot of TV news, but he does read a lot of news.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s old school that way.\xc2\xa0 But he watches some.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, he catches it.\xc2\xa0 He is very current on those developments.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no organized or mechanized way that he\xe2\x80\x99s -- that those issues are brought to him, because they\xe2\x80\x99re right there, obviously, in front of him when he reads the newspaper or -- on his iPad, or catches it sometimes on the television in the Outer Oval.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on a separate issue of keeping tabs on things, who in the White House -- how are you keeping up with the super committee?\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to influence its deliberations?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have tried to influence its deliberations by putting forward a plan -- a complete, comprehensive, balanced plan -- that are -- that basically are recommendations that this President has put forward for the super committee to consider. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have to act.\xc2\xa0 It is -- this is a congressional committee mandated by an act of Congress with a target set by Congress -- a target that the President\xe2\x80\x99s plan would far exceed.\xc2\xa0 But he encourages them to look at his proposals, because he believes very strongly that they represent the kind of approach that will both deal with the problem for the medium and long term, and also the kind of approach that is broadly supported by the American people, because it is balanced and fair.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s no more involvement than that in this period of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have our communications with Congress in general, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not -- this is a committee on which there are no members of the executive branch sitting.\xc2\xa0 This is a congressional committee, and obviously they are engaged in trying to reach an agreement that will at least meet the target set by the legislation and, we certainly hope, exceed it, as long as it\xe2\x80\x99s done in a balanced way.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
