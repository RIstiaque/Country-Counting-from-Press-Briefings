EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 This is the third installment of our Asia trip briefings.\xc2\xa0 This will cover the South Korea and Japan portions of the trip -- the G20, APEC, and our visit to South Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As we\'ve done in the past, we\'ll have Ben go through the schedule, just to give you the logistical outlay of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear next from Mike Froman and then lastly from Lael Brainard, who\xe2\x80\x99s our Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs, to brief you up on different aspects of the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Robert, can you tell us what the President is doing today and tomorrow, any other details besides his meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in the process of and will throughout the day tape several syndicated radio programs, most of which will air tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And then this evening between 8:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., he\xe2\x80\x99s doing similar calls with Democratic volunteers and activists in Florida, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Hawaii.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hawaii?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Our 50th state -- yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just say a few things at the top and go through the schedule.\xc2\xa0 I know we\'ve gone through it, but just to contextualize what you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Mike and Lael.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today we want to cover the economic portion of the trip, building on the political components that Jeff Bader and I went through last week.\xc2\xa0 If there are questions about bilats unrelated to economics, we can try to take those, too, but I think we covered a lot of it last week.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to lay down, this is -- at the top -- the G20, I think as you know from covering us, we\'ve shifted the focus of our international economic cooperation from the G8 to the G20.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s really not an area of attention on the international stage that\'s gotten the kind of focus that we\'ve applied to our efforts to the G20 to avert an economic catastrophe and to promote balance in global growth.\xc2\xa0 So we see the G20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Similarly, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard us underscore, the President\xe2\x80\x99s export agenda is fundamental to our jobs agenda here at home.\xc2\xa0 So in both Seoul and in Japan he\'ll have the opportunity to discuss how we\'re trying to pursue greater U.S. exports in Asian markets.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But Mike will lay down that, and Lael as well.\xc2\xa0 I\'ll just give you the schedule again quickly for some context.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We begin Thursday morning, the 11th, in Seoul, having arrived there from Jakarta.\xc2\xa0 As I said, we\'ll do a Veterans Day event that morning in Seoul where the President will speak to U.S. troops and commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean War.\xc2\xa0 Then we\'ll have the bilateral meeting with President Lee at the Blue House.\xc2\xa0 And Mike can talk to the topics there, which will include both the G20 and our efforts around the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the bilat with President Lee, the President will have a bilateral meeting with President Hu Jintao of China.\xc2\xa0 Again, Jeff Bader walked you through some of the political and security components of that.\xc2\xa0 Mike can walk through some of the economic components of that bilateral meeting, and Lael as well. And then we enter into the official program of the G20 that night with the G20 working dinner among the leaders.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Friday the 12th is the official G20 program -- morning plenary session, a working lunch, and an afternoon plenary -- familiar to all of you who\xe2\x80\x99ve covered G20s before.\xc2\xa0 The President will close the G20 with a press conference in Seoul, and then he will make his way to Yokohama.\xc2\xa0 I should add, he\xe2\x80\x99ll also do a press conference with President Lee on the 11th, so there will be press conferences on both the 11th and the 12th.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Then on Saturday, just as the G20 is a focus in terms of representing broader international architecture for international economic issues -- again the reason being that we shifted from the G8 to the G20 because in the 21st century we believe you need emerging economies at the table -- China, India, Brazil and others.\xc2\xa0 Just as that\xe2\x80\x99s a focus of our international efforts, engaging regional organizations like APEC is something that we focused on from the beginning of this administration, the theory being that the U.S. had disengaged somewhat from organizations like ASEAN and APEC and others, and that the U.S. wanted to be at the table in shaping Asian architecture.\xc2\xa0 And Hillary Clinton recently attended the East Asia Summit to be a part of that renewed U.S. engagement.\xc2\xa0 So APEC is an important institution to the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThat morning, on Saturday the 13th, the President will give a speech to a CEO summit that happens concurrently with the APEC summit.\xc2\xa0 In that speech, again, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an opportunity to discuss both the balanced growth agenda globally and our efforts to increase exports to Asia.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThen he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Kan of Japan, of course one of our closest allies in the region in the world, and again the second trip the President will be making to Japan since taking office.</p>\n<p>\n\tThen he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Gillard of Australia.\xc2\xa0 I anticipate that will focus, again, largely on some of the security issues and political issues that Jeff addressed the other day.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThen we enter into the APEC program with their working lunch and leaders retreat.\xc2\xa0 And there\'s a cultural event that evening and an official dinner.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe next morning, Sunday, the 14th, the President will have a bilateral meeting with President Medvedev of Russia.\xc2\xa0 Of course he\xe2\x80\x99ll build on the cooperation they\xe2\x80\x99ve had on a range of issues\xc2\xa0 -- nonproliferation, nuclear security, Iran, North Korea -- but also mark the progress that\'s been made towards Russia joining the WTO.\xc2\xa0 And Mike can speak a little bit about that.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd then following that, the APEC meetings conclude with the leaders retreat and working lunch.\xc2\xa0 And then the President will visit a statue of the Great Buddha in the neighborhood of Yokohama.\xc2\xa0 And then he will return to the United States on the 14th.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo -- Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Ben.\xc2\xa0 As you all know, this is the fourth G20 that President Obama will be attending.\xc2\xa0 And as in the case of London, Pittsburgh and Toronto, the agenda is a broad one and covers not only the management of the economic crisis but laying the foundation for the post-crisis global economy.\xc2\xa0 As Ben said, the G20 is now considered the premiere forum for international economic cooperation and includes the largest emerging and developed country economies, plus the attendance of various international organizations and regional organizations, and it deals with a whole broad range of issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe leaders will talk about the status of the recovery, the mechanisms to be put in place to ensure strong balance and sustainable growth; the importance of completing the work to put in place a 21st century financial regulatory system; the steps to be taken to reform the international financial institutions; and the agenda for addressing energy security, climate change, trade, and anti-corruption.\xc2\xa0 In addition, the Koreans have put on the G20 agenda the issue of development, and development policy will become an ongoing focus of the G20 as well.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This agenda is critical to our economy back here at home, to our recovery and our ability to increase exports and create well-paying jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 For example, with regard to the framework, the objective of ensuring a durable recovery and avoiding the reemergence of imbalances goes to the issue of the U.S. consumer no longer being the consumer of last resort, and the need to have greater domestic demand in other countries around the world.\xc2\xa0 If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to save and export more, we need others to spend and import more.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s key to our objective of doubling our exports and creating jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 Similarly, on the financial regulatory front we\xe2\x80\x99ve put in place through Dodd-Frank the most sweeping set of financial regulatory changes in 70 years.\xc2\xa0 And to create a level playing field, we need to ensure that other countries put in place similar reforms.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the financial regulatory agenda is all about.\xc2\xa0 And Lael we\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about both of these issues in greater detail.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In Pittsburgh, we agreed to make changes to the international financial institutions, both their governance as well as the facilities they provide, to deal with crises like this.\xc2\xa0 And Seoul will be delivering on that commitment.\xc2\xa0 And in Pittsburgh, we also made a commitment to begin to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies over the medium term.\xc2\xa0 This is good fiscal policy; it\xe2\x80\x99s good health policy; it\xe2\x80\x99s good energy policy; it\xe2\x80\x99s good climate policy.\xc2\xa0 And, in fact, it may be the most important thing the G20 does in addressing climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve made some progress in this area and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work along those lines.\xc2\xa0 And, finally, with regard to the G20, in Toronto the U.S. proposed a robust anti-corruption agenda.\xc2\xa0 And we welcome the G20 taking up this agenda.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s critical, again, to creating a level playing field around the world on this important issue.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me say a word about APEC.\xc2\xa0 APEC will be held in Yokohama.\xc2\xa0 APEC is, as you all know, a group of 21 economies.\xc2\xa0 It is the primary forum for economic integration discussions in the Asia Pacific.\xc2\xa0 And that is vital -- that region and further economic integration, trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be discussing sustainable, inclusive green growth. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be reviewing the status of the trade liberalization measures that have been underway for the last 15 years and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be laying the foundation for next year when the U.S. hosts APEC in November 2011 in Honolulu.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I turn it over to Lael.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Mike.\xc2\xa0 So let me just drill down on some of the core areas of our economic agenda for the G20 summit in Seoul.\xc2\xa0 As Mike said, President Obama remains intensely focused on promoting economic growth, to create job opportunities for our workers, and export opportunities for our small businesses, our manufacturers, our farmers and our service providers.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The risk is increasingly clear that uncoordinated and unilateral actions could undermine the strong, sustained and balanced growth that we all need in the G20.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President has outlined a cooperative framework for the Seoul summit, building on the groundwork laid by finance ministers and central bank governors in Gyeongju -- reducing external imbalances, facilitating exchange rate adjustment, and establishing an assessment mechanism at the IMF.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We will seek leaders\xe2\x80\x99 endorsement of the framework laid out by finance ministers on limiting excessive imbalances.\xc2\xa0 At its core is a very important commitment that surplus countries no less than deficit countries will reduce external imbalances to sustainable levels.\xc2\xa0 This is critical to ensure that as the U.S. and other deficit countries seek a more balanced growth path, other countries use all the tools at their disposal to boost domestic demand so there are multiple engines of growth, greater export opportunities, and stronger job growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For too long, the American consumer was the engine of growth for the entire global economy.\xc2\xa0 That pattern of growth, we have seen, was unsustainable.\xc2\xa0 As we act here to address those imbalances by repairing our balance sheets, boosting our national saving, and investing in U.S. competitiveness to achieve the President\xe2\x80\x99s export goals, other nations that have relied excessively on exports must act to boost their domestic demand or we will all risk lower overall growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This agenda will be important throughout the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip in Asia.\xc2\xa0 Many Asian economies in particular have strong potential to fuel domestic demand either through domestic consumption in some cases, through major infrastructure investments in other cases, and through both, in other countries. This provides important opportunities for America\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic exporters, and it also boosts growth more broadly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Second, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to look for more progress on the part of key emerging market economies and moving to market determined exchange rates based on economic fundamentals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When large economies with undervalued exchange rates act to keep their currencies from appreciating, it imposes an unfair burden of adjustment on other countries that are running more flexible exchange rate regimes.\xc2\xa0 Solving this problem is going to require a cooperative approach, because emerging economies individually will be less likely to move unless they are assured that their neighbors will do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Third, the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, has to play a greater role in ensuring countries meet these stated commitments.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very much in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest to reform the IMF\xe2\x80\x99s governance to make it more effective by making it more reflective of 21st century realities with emerging market economies, taking on more responsibilities in line with their growing weight.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, as Mike mentioned, international cooperation on financial regulatory reform remains crucial to avoid a race to the bottom, and to ensure a level playing field.\xc2\xa0 In Seoul, the G20 and the Financial Stability Board will set out a road map to ensure that FSB and G20 members provide the appropriate incentives and implement the requisite tools to ensure no financial institution is too big to fail.\xc2\xa0 As you know, this is a core achievement of the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The G20 as a whole will need to make progress on three fronts:\xc2\xa0 ensuring the largest, most complex firms have enhanced capacity to absorb losses and are subject to enhanced supervision; implementing strong national resolution regimes that ensure taxpayers don\'t bear the burden; and building international cooperative frameworks to ensure that national resolution authorities work together to liquidate cross-border firms in an orderly manner.\xc2\xa0 The recent agreement on Basel 3, of course, was a major achievement in this regard.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, you\xe2\x80\x99ll recall and Mike has reminded us that President Obama and other G20 leaders agreed in Pittsburgh to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.\xc2\xa0 This is part of our collective effort to encourage energy conservation, improve energy security, reduce budgetary burdens and, of course, start delivering on our commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, countries are starting to take action.\xc2\xa0 In particular, in India, the government announced it will deregulate gasoline prices and raise prices for a variety of fossil fuels.\xc2\xa0 And in Mexico the government has begun phasing out motor fuel subsidies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Here the administration, in coordination with Congress, is pursuing the elimination of over $3 billion in non-research and development preferential tax incentives for the coal, oil and gas industries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, in short, we will work in Seoul to advance key initiatives to enhance America\xe2\x80\x99s growth and provide a cooperative framework to address the major challenges currently facing the global economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Who has something off of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have some questions about the Korea FTA.\xc2\xa0 The broad question is what chances do you think you\xe2\x80\x99ll have of getting the deal done?\xc2\xa0 And then, more specifically, what additional concessions do you want from Korea to address U.S. concerns about the auto market, in particular?\xc2\xa0 And are there any other substantive changes to the pact that are in the offing?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, as the President has long said, we want to try and address the outstanding issues regarding the FTA in order to bring it forward for approval.\xc2\xa0 Those outstanding issues fall largely in the areas of autos and beef.\xc2\xa0 We have been engaged with our stakeholders here at home -- in Congress and other stakeholders -- as well as with the Koreans to work through those issues.\xc2\xa0 Those discussions are underway.\xc2\xa0 I can\'t predict at this point how they will proceed, but we\'re going to put every effort into achieving an acceptable agreement, a satisfactory agreement by the time the President comes to Seoul.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a target in mind for U.S. auto sales to South Korea?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a whole variety of issues around auto market access that we\'re in dialogue with.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. proposed that Korea agree to allow U.S. imports of autos that meet our safety and emission standards?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Rather than get into the details of what we\'re proposing, because we\'re in the process of back-and-forth consultations, we\'ve had a series of discussions about a range of issues in the auto sector.\xc2\xa0 Those discussions will continue over the next week and a half or so in the run-up to the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If I could follow up on that, at this late date are you expecting an agreement -- a framework agreement on principles, or actually a detailed working-out of all the issues at the G20 on the Korea FTA?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 We\'re going to put maximum effort into trying to resolve the outstanding issues by the time of the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is about fiscal issues.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to be going to the G20 amid British austerity plans, the Germans are preaching austerity, the French are pursuing long-term pension reforms, and it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear that the President is going to be suffering at the polls tomorrow in an election that\xe2\x80\x99s animated by government spending.\xc2\xa0 I wonder how isolated might the President be on fiscal issues and how much of a role will fiscal issues play at the G20?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 I think there is broad agreement that the United States needs to continue providing support to the economy until the handoff to the private sector is well established.\xc2\xa0 That said, the United States, under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, has one of the most aggressive fiscal consolidation plans among the G20 economies.\xc2\xa0 We are well on track to meeting our goals of halving the deficit by 2013 and by achieving fiscal sustainability in line with the 2016 framework.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In particular, as you know, the President has laid out a number of concrete measures to achieve those goals, including a freeze on non-security discretionary spending, a commitment not to extend the tax cut for the wealthiest 2 percent of American households, and the health care bill also makes very important contributions to those goals.\xc2\xa0 And finally, of course, the fiscal commission will be delivering its recommendations in December and the President is looking forward to those recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, how can you say that the administration is well on its way towards its goal of cutting the deficit in half when the deficit actually fell just a tiny bit last year?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So if you look -- again, the important balance to be struck here is to support the recovery until the handoff to the private sector is well established, while anchoring fiscal consolidation, an ambitious medium-term fiscal consolidation framework.\xc2\xa0 So if you look across the G20 economies, 2011 through 2016, you will see a steeper path of fiscal consolidation in the United States compared with most of the other G20 economies.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget as outlined meets those deficit reduction goals.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me, if I could, just ask this a slightly different way.\xc2\xa0 Is there much concern about the withdrawal of stimulus from other G20 countries, or are we all -- are you comfortable with -- from the other countries as well?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So if you look at the fiscal consolidation paths of many of the major economies in the G20, care has been taken to ensure that there is not a risk from consolidated withdrawal in a synchronous manner.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that reflected in the Toronto declaration.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll see it reflected also in the agreement among finance meetings in Gyeongju.\xc2\xa0 So there is an awareness of the risk of synchronized withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, and care has been taken to ensure that that will not imperil the recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no concerns that some countries are withdrawing too quickly?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So at the current moment, we\xe2\x80\x99re very focused on -- for the G20, we\xe2\x80\x99re much more focused on the set of issues surrounding global imbalances, as I was saying earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we just follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Is there anything more that can be done to press China to appreciate its currency?\xc2\xa0 And do you accept that the fin min meeting has calmed currency markets?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So I think what we will be seeing in Seoul is -- we hope to see an endorsement of the framework that was put forward by finance ministers and central bank governors in Gyeongju.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me just remind you that that has very important elements -- both a commitment to reduce external imbalances to sustainable levels, applying to surplus countries and deficit countries alike, and a recognition that countries should use all the tools at their disposal.\xc2\xa0 There are a whole host of policies that China will be undertaking and should be undertaking to rebalance its demand towards domestic sources of growth.\xc2\xa0 And those are very important I think in this framework.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe second thing, of course, is a commitment on the part of key emerging economies to move more quickly to market-determined exchange rates that reflect economic fundamentals.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those two things together we hope will start to put on the table a cooperative framework to move to the necessary goal of more balanced growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you define what you meant by \xe2\x80\x9cmore progress\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of those -- what you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see by G20?\xc2\xa0 You said in your opening remarks you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see more progress by the summit.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So I think we had the outlines of a very significant path forward -- cooperative path forward in Gyeongju.\xc2\xa0 What we would like to do working now towards Seoul and from Seoul further into next year is to start to put flesh on the bones of those agreements and to continue working to elaborate the kinds of actions that individual countries will take to support this more broad cooperative path forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Including numerical targets?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 On the question of targets, we actually don\xe2\x80\x99t think targets,<br/>\n\tper se -- a target, per se, is appropriate.\xc2\xa0 What we talked about in Gyeongju were indicative guidelines that would define ranges, a range of sustainability that as countries begin to move outside to more sustained larger imbalances outside those ranges, that it would trigger an assessment, a peer review mechanism, and really an attempt to look for what kinds of corrective actions could be taken.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working to put more flesh on the bones of those basic parameters going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Can I just add one thing to that?\xc2\xa0 We do not expect the China currency issue or the imbalance issue to be solved once and for all in Seoul.\xc2\xa0 This is part of an ongoing effort.\xc2\xa0 Finance ministers made very good progress two weeks ago. Leaders will take up the issues and continue to work on it.\xc2\xa0 But this is an ongoing effort, not something that would be resolved once and for all by leaders in Seoul.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ben mentioned that Mr. Froman can talk about the WTO and Russia.\xc2\xa0 What can the U.S. do at this stage to help Russia to finish -- complete the accession?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, President Obama and President Medvedev made a strong commitment to each other earlier this year to work on a very fast timetable to resolve the outstanding issues between our countries.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been very good work done between trade officials in both countries.\xc2\xa0 And on a bilateral basis, our major outstanding issues are now resolved and that\xe2\x80\x99s a very significant step forward towards Russia\xe2\x80\x99s WTO accession.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are -- we\xe2\x80\x99ll be working with Russia, with the EU, and with the other members of the multilateral process to try and move this process forward towards their accession as early as possible.\xc2\xa0 There is still a great deal of work for Russia to do with the EU and other members of the WTO, but we\xe2\x80\x99re very supportive of that and will be working with them to try and facilitate that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The others would include the Georgians?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 With all the members of the WTO.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And I had a question on the IFIs.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of reform at the IMF is to increase the voice for the developing countries and lift the legitimacy of the IMF, right?\xc2\xa0 So currently the proportion between the rich and the poor there is 60 to 40.\xc2\xa0 The G20 fin mins agreed to move less than 3 percent of that number to the poor.\xc2\xa0 And the proportion so will be what\xc2\xa0 -- 43 to 57.\xc2\xa0 Is that enough?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not even 5 percent, as agreed under Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So I think the agreement that was laid out in Gyeongju and we hope that leaders will endorse in Seoul is a very significant agreement.\xc2\xa0 It delivers on the commitments made in Pittsburgh.\xc2\xa0 It transfers 6 percent to emerging market and developing underrepresented economies.\xc2\xa0 It also has an additional two seats on the executive board for emerging market economies.\xc2\xa0 And it provides for ongoing regular review of both the chairs and shares issues into the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The other things that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked much about but are also important is it provides additional tools for the IMF to use to prevent crises and provides additional resources to enable it to be more effective in the face of crises.\xc2\xa0 So together there\xe2\x80\x99s a very significant package of reform and we look forward to the leaders welcoming it in Seoul.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you know that this package -- more than half of that package is the redistribution of votes among the poor countries, such as Ukraine, for instance.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not even speaking about South Africa -- which is not what the whole deal was about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I think it is very true to the original Pittsburgh commitments.\xc2\xa0 If you look carefully at the communique, you will see that it more than delivers on the Pittsburgh commitments.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very good deal, and we think in particular what it does is it reflects the growing responsibilities as well as the growing roles of the dynamic emerging economies in the International Monetary Fund, which is similar to their growing role in the G20 and the world economy overall.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you anticipate that the election results will have any impact on the negotiations over the free trade agreement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think regardless of the election results, the President is committed throughout this whole trip and including the negotiations over the free trade agreement to doing what is right for expanding U.S. exports and creating jobs here at home. That\'s why he\xe2\x80\x99s going to Asia, and starting with India, where you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard our discussion of his program there -- Indonesia, Korea, and Japan -- and participating in a number of efforts to expand U.S. export opportunities and jobs here at home.\xc2\xa0 So I think that will be his agenda, regardless of the outcome of the election tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Regardless of the outcome, to what extent is the President going to have to devote time to reassuring some of these trading partners in other countries that always have jitters about political changes in this country about the way forward?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I mean, I imagine politics in the U.S. will be a subject on this trip.\xc2\xa0 Other countries are interested in what goes on in this country.\xc2\xa0 But I think the President has been pretty firm that if he can achieve, in the case of Korea, an agreement that addresses the outstanding issues and expands access for U.S. exports, that he is willing to move that forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Peter, I will say this.\xc2\xa0 I think on some of those issues, that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be -- that may well be a better question for some in this country that want to see progress on free trade agreements; on the business side, having discussions with and understanding the positions of potentially new members of Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much each of these individual campaigns have focused on some of those things.\xc2\xa0 But you can -- look, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m saying anything new here to -- see, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a decent amount of coverage of the fact that in magazines devoted mostly to business that there\xe2\x80\x99s some general trepidation about the views and the viewpoints of some of those who could be coming to Congress.\xc2\xa0 Those, I think, are not things that the President necessarily will or can have a ton of impact on.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s going to be some of the individual candidates.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?\xc2\xa0 Are you concerned by the impact of the American election on the image of America all over the world?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that regardless of the outcome of this election, of the previous elections, or elections in the future, it demonstrates once again the most powerful example for the world to see the American people exercising their constitutional responsibilities and living up to the framework of government by the people.\xc2\xa0 I think that is -- I think it is a testament to the great American experience that we conduct elections in the way we do and we bring about electoral change in a peaceful way.\xc2\xa0 I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great example for everyone to see.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the fiscal commission, the administration seems to be putting a lot of weight on that.\xc2\xa0 And you also seem optimistic about meeting your 2013 goal of halving a deficit -- a federal deficit.\xc2\xa0 The fiscal commission is reportedly going to reach agreement, or at least near agreement, on two-thirds spending cuts, one-third tax expenditures.\xc2\xa0 Now, in light of tax expenditures, are you all willing to support phasing out tax expenditures, including the 2001, 2003 tax cuts, in light of your concern over the deficit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, it is November the 1st and the report from the fiscal commission is due on December the 1st.\xc2\xa0 I am not going to get into hypothetical agreements that we\xe2\x80\x99ve yet to see.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the President wanted a fiscal commission to help work through some of the big issues in getting our fiscal house in order; did so through executive order.\xc2\xa0 And we will certainly look forward to reviewing the report, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get into speculating as to what the report might show.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Talking about the American having been the consumer of last resort, right now you look at the American consumer and they\xe2\x80\x99re down on their backs.\xc2\xa0 How could they become the consumer of last resort again if the rest of the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stimulate their own consumption?\xc2\xa0 Could you explain how that could happen?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 No, I think this is precisely what all of the members of the G20 have to grapple with and have to recognize.\xc2\xa0 The U.S. consumer is in the middle of repairing their balance sheets, and if we are going to see a more balanced path of growth forward, it means that you need to see demand coming from other sources in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why we think that this cooperative framework on the table that includes getting both surplus and deficit countries to reduce their imbalances to sustainable ranges, by using the full set of policies -- to expand domestic demand in economies that have traditionally relied on exports to the U.S. for growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is just tremendous capacity, as you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see during the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip, in many of these economies to generate a lot more growth through the investments they need to make in their own infrastructure, through domestic consumption.\xc2\xa0 And so what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to -- if we want to see strong overall growth -- and this is a recognition that has to come from all members of the G20, I think that recognition is there -- we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to see sources of demand coming from other economies.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have a follow-up.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a follow-up, go ahead.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In short, our stimulus at home could put the consumer back on his feet and we would end up bailing out the rest of the world if the rest of the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t develop its consumer base. Is that --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 No, no, quite the reverse.\xc2\xa0 Let me just back up a step.\xc2\xa0 So I think the discussions that we anticipate having in Seoul, the groundwork for which was laid two weeks ago in Gyeongyu, Korea, were really to talk about a cooperative approach on the part of the major economies in the G20, whereby recognizing that the U.S. needs to save more; that the U.S. consumer needs to repair its balance sheet; we need to find other sources of dynamism, other sources of growth, in the world economy.\xc2\xa0 And that is why this agreement on reducing imbalances in surplus economies, no less in deficit countries, is so critically important for ensuring we all see stronger growth.\xc2\xa0 In the U.S. it would come very much from exports and from our dynamic private sector.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to follow up, thank you.\xc2\xa0 This is a crucial time, as far as the global economy is concerned.\xc2\xa0 Since the President will be in India, next-door to China, which China is not willing to move, as far as the global economy is concerned, or helpful to the IMF and other developing countries -- India is an emerging country, and how the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to India with the vision on trade and creation of jobs and also, as far as other issues are concerned, will affect or impact his trip?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also, if I may have a question for Robert Gibbs also, please.\xc2\xa0 As far as the President\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, let\xe2\x80\x99s do this one first before we --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I guess, just to comment on the India part of the trip, as you know, this is the first stop on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Asia and we very much view India as a critical component of Asia.\xc2\xa0 And it being a very fast-growing economy, a very successful economy, we see great opportunities in the bilateral economic relationship.\xc2\xa0 We also see great opportunities in working with India, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s in the G20 or elsewhere, on broader, global economic issues.\xc2\xa0 And the relationship that President Obama has with Prime Minister Singh, I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking -- they have a good relationship around these issues, and look forward to working together on them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they going to be together in Seoul?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll both be at the G20, but there\'s no plans for a separate meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 My question for Robert is that as the President prepares to leave for India, big issues now there because among the millions of his supporters, especially Sikhs -- the Prime Minister of India comes from the same element -- he used to -- was supposed to visit Golden Temple in Amritsar.\xc2\xa0 And there are emails and they have sent thousands of letters to the President why he\xe2\x80\x99s not visiting Golden Temple and also Taj Mahal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 Well, Goyal, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said, I think, a couple of times in these briefings and I\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly said before we started these briefings, we are in India for three days.\xc2\xa0 There\'s\xc2\xa0 -- you could spend a lot longer than that, and obviously anybody would.\xc2\xa0 We picked our schedule based on what we wanted to get accomplished, and that focus was on New Delhi and Mumbai.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the focus of our trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Look, anybody that would go would love to spend a lot more time there.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re afforded a short trip to a very important country in a very important region of the world because the trip obviously is also anchored by the important economic meetings later on in the trip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mike, in terms of the effect of the agreements that you have on the table on this trip, the whole thing, are there -- are any of these -- are they all long term, or are there actually short-term things that might have a demonstrable effect on the economy or the unemployment rate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole range of things that we\xe2\x80\x99re working on.\xc2\xa0 In India, for example, there will be discussion about economic issues between the two countries, some of which could be resolved, some of which will take longer to resolve.\xc2\xa0 But there also will be discussion of various commercial contracts that we hope to bring to fruition between now and the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip that are immediate and will create jobs back here at home right away and expand U.S. exports.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so whether it\xe2\x80\x99s that or what\xe2\x80\x99s being done in Korea with the FTA and the G20, or the APEC discussions in Japan, it will be a whole range of discussions that will have an impact not just in the long term but also in the short run.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The sale of the C-17s, does that seem imminent?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to when you talk about India?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave announcements for the announcements.\xc2\xa0 But there are a whole range of potential contracts that are being worked on as we speak.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jobs that could be created in the next two years?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, absolutely.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious about the Korean War anniversary.\xc2\xa0 Will there be an effort to engage or comments directed at the North Korean regime or outreach to the North Korean people or an effort to contrast where South Korea is 60 years later versus where North Korea is 60 years later?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. RHODES:\xc2\xa0 Actually, I think the end of your question hits exactly on I think what we would be doing.\xc2\xa0 In speaking on Veterans Day, we\xe2\x80\x99ll obviously honor all American veterans and particularly those who\xe2\x80\x99ve served in the Korean War and on the Korean Peninsula for the last 60 years.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll also, though, have the opportunity to celebrate the achievement of South Korea, which is quite extraordinary.\xc2\xa0 If you look at where South Korea and North Korea were 60 years ago, they were roughly analogous in terms of their development, for instance.\xc2\xa0 And in the 60 years since the Korean War, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an extraordinary amount of economic growth and dynamism in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen living standards rise exponentially in South Korea.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a very strong and thriving democracy emerge in South Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Contrast that to the North, which has seen -- again, freedom is completely prohibited from its people, has seen huge economic problems that have led to a very drastically poor quality of life for the people of North Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think the President will hold up the achievement of the Republic of Korea, of South Koreans, in building their democracy and their economy.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll celebrate, frankly, the partnership between the U.S. and South Korea that helped make that possible, with those many decades of American servicemen and women who helped facilitate the security necessary for the democratic development in South Korea, and say, yes, this is a very clear -- the strength of the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea sends a very clear message to the North about our commitment to the security of the Korean Peninsula.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it also -- South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s example sends a very powerful message to the North, to the people of the North, and to the world about the power of democratic values, the power of open markets.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just a message for the peninsula; that\xe2\x80\x99s a message for the entire world -- I think the President heralded at UNGA -- that South Korea stands as a model for what can be achieved by countries that move towards open markets and democracy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the administration -- this is a question for Ms. Brainard -- does the administration at this point support passage in the lame duck in the Senate of a China currency bill, and would that decision hinge at all on the G20 outcome?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about potential legislation in the congressional session, but let me just say that the administration supports certainly the goals, shares the concerns of many members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 It is very important to see China move forward on its commitment to a market-determined exchange rate that reflects market fundamentals.\xc2\xa0 We saw an accelerated pace of appreciation between early September and the time that we released the statement on October 15th.\xc2\xa0 If we continue to see progress of that nature, it would make a material difference in the significant undervaluation of the Chinese currency.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep working, using all the channels we have, to make progress on that front.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s one for you, Robert.\xc2\xa0 Is the President blocking out time while he\xe2\x80\x99s in Asia to be working on these domestic issues?\xc2\xa0 Because the Congress is going to be coming back in the lame duck session to work on the tax cut issues that Under Secretary Brainard talked about.\xc2\xa0 And obviously is he prepared to take a whole lot of questions from us on these press conferences that are going to probably be more domestic than international?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. GIBBS:\xc2\xa0 On the second one, you can be assured-</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0that the President will be prepared, Jonathan, with whatever question you might have.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not entirely sure how I would have answered that differently.\xc2\xa0 Yes, I mean, look, Jonathan, we went to Asia last year and got a lot of questions about back here.\xc2\xa0 So we get that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the second part, look, there\xe2\x80\x99s -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll do some -- there have been certainly discussions here about -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly talked through a number of issues that were and still are pending off of -- when Congress last convened.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that he\xe2\x80\x99ll do some of that there and there will certainly be significant staff that will be here even as we\xe2\x80\x99re in Asia.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. support a permanent G20 secretariat?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 There are a lot of issues around the evolution of the G20.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased that the G20 has emerged as the premier forum for international economic cooperation.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re making progress on the outstanding agenda of items that had been agreed to at previous summits.\xc2\xa0 We think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that the G20 fulfill the commitments that it makes.\xc2\xa0 And we will be working with the rest of the G20 to see how best to evolve the institution over time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for my own benefit, you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the term \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced growth\xe2\x80\x9d several times here.\xc2\xa0 I want just a thumbnail description of what you see as balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 Is it just taking on these trade imbalance issues or -- I mean, to achieve that, what would you envelop in that term?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So I think if you go back to Pittsburgh, you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember that one of the signature achievements there was to get agreement that the G20 was going to commit itself to undertaking in each member economy policies consistent with strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 And that was in large part in recognition that there were large imbalances that fueled the crisis that we saw going into the crisis, and that as we worked to repair the damage from the crisis that we need to find a different growth path forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the framework that the President will want to advance in Seoul really recognizes that if you want to have strong growth, as you are undertaking that rebalancing, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to see additional sources of demand in the global economy.\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be the U.S. consumer that fuels global growth in the coming months and years -- as we all do what we need to do here, which is to increase savings and to increase our export competitiveness.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd so that is the sense in which we\xe2\x80\x99re using balanced growth.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why this framework to reduce imbalances in surplus economies no less than deficit countries is so critically important, and why we need to make sure that there\'s cooperation on exchange rates, so that exchange rates are flexible and moving with market forces to help facilitate that rebalancing.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I address the 4 percent GDP figure that the U.S. has proposed?\xc2\xa0 How optimistic are you that that can be an agreement by all parties?\xc2\xa0 And specifically, with regard to China, some reports have said that they have reacted positively. Is that your sense?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So right now, what we are working to do is to ensure that leaders endorse the framework that was put on the table by finance ministers and central bank governors in Gyeongju, which talked about the development of indicative guidelines -- the development of guidelines to lay out ranges within which current accounts would be seen to be sustainable for our goals and outside of which it would prompt an assessment and a look at some of the root causes, and shining the light, perhaps, on some of the key corrective policy actions that need to be taking place.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are going to be looking to start fleshing that out.\xc2\xa0 But really, at this juncture, what we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for is agreement around the basic proposition that it\xe2\x80\x99s very important for surplus economies no less than deficit economies to be reducing imbalances and to make sure that exchange rates are facilitating that adjustment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What do you mean by range?\xc2\xa0 You suggested a range.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?\xc2\xa0 What range?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes -- meaning numerical?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think, again, what we\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing is working towards greater flesh on the bones of the framework that was laid out by finance ministers in Seoul and then beyond Seoul, and greater clarity on what indicative guidelines might be used to determine what ranges are sustainable.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So at this juncture, that\xe2\x80\x99s really what we are going to be focusing on, is those indicative guidelines, and the extremely important agreement on the principle that surplus economies no less than deficit economies need to get their imbalances down to sustainable ranges in order to fuel and create greater sources of demand in the global economy.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk and focus on the export promotion.\xc2\xa0 What exactly are you going to export?\xc2\xa0 In India, \xe2\x80\x9cMade in U.S.A.\xe2\x80\x9d is a very welcome brand.\xc2\xa0 What exactly are you going to export?\xc2\xa0 Do you have a plan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a planned economy.\xc2\xa0 But we have a very globally competitive manufacturing service and agricultural sectors.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to export from each of those.\xc2\xa0 So we have some of the leading companies in the world. Our agriculture is very efficient.\xc2\xa0 And we have some of the premier services companies in the world.\xc2\xa0 So in all areas of our economy, we hope to expand exports to a fast-growing market like India.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to come back to the IMF for a second.\xc2\xa0 I am speaking about the legitimacy of this organization, which is undermined, even as compared to the World Bank, which made the more meaningful step to reform.\xc2\xa0 You referred that there will be periodic reviews.\xc2\xa0 When is the next step?\xc2\xa0 When is the periodic review?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 UNDER SECRETARY BRAINARD:\xc2\xa0 So with regard to voting and quota shares, which is I think what you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, the agreement that was reached in Gyeongju would have us do an accelerated review both of the formula and of quota shares in 2014, and looking at giving greater weight to countries\xe2\x80\x99 share of income in the world economy as part of that review.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think the election results could make it easier to win approval for the FDA, given that Midwestern Democrats have been raising the autos issue stronger than others?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. FROMAN:\xc2\xa0 I think our approach -- the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the FTA is the same, which is we will seek to achieve an agreement that addresses the outstanding issues, expands access for competitive U.S. products.\xc2\xa0 And if we\xe2\x80\x99re successful in achieving a satisfactory and an acceptable agreement, we will make clear the advantages of that agreement for the U.S. workers, U.S. farmers, U.S. manufacturers, and U.S. service providers.\xc2\xa0 And again, that will be the process that we go through if we\xe2\x80\x99re successful in achieving successful agreement.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
