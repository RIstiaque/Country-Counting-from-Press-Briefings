EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everyone.\xc2\xa0 I, again, apologize for the delay.\xc2\xa0 I am waiting for my first slow news day on this job.\xc2\xa0 It is not today.\xc2\xa0 It is a news day -- that\'s for sure.\xc2\xa0 I have a couple of things I\'d like to say at the top here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 First, as many of you know, we had a briefing on the President\xe2\x80\x99s Latin America trip earlier today, and I wanted to follow up on a question.\xc2\xa0 The State Department will be hosting a Spanish language briefing tomorrow on the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip.\xc2\xa0 Some foreign press were asking about further updates and I wanted to provide that information.\xc2\xa0 They should look to the State Department for the details.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secondly, I\'d like to mention that today the President called both King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and King Hamad of Bahrain to discuss the situation in Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 The President expressed his deep concern over the violence in Bahrain and stressed the need for maximum restraint.\xc2\xa0 The President also stressed the importance of a political process as the only way to peacefully address the legitimate grievances of Bahrainis and to lead to a Bahrain that is stable, just, more unified and responsive to its people.\xc2\xa0 The President reiterated his support for the national dialogue initiative led by Bahraini Crown Prince Salman.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On a separate issue, the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Greg Jaczko, came to the White House today to brief the President.\xc2\xa0 He gave the President an update on the deteriorating situation at the nuclear power plant in Japan.\xc2\xa0 Others in attendance at the briefing included National Security Advisor Tom Donilon, Homeland Security Advisor John Brennan, Deputy National Security Advisor Denis McDonough, White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, and John Holdren, the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the briefing Chairman Jaczko updated the President on the status of the reactors at the plant in Japan and on additional protective measures the United States is taking to ensure the safety of American citizens in that region of Japan.\xc2\xa0 He informed the President that it was his recommendation -- and this recommendation has turned into the advice of the State Department -- that American citizens in Japan evacuate -- those American citizens who are within a 50-mile radius of the reactors evacuate from that area.\xc2\xa0 This is the same advice that the NRC would give if this incident were taking place in the United States, to evacuate beyond a 50-mile radius.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will take your questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Erica.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you talk about The New York Times journalists that are missing in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of that?\xc2\xa0 And what is the U.S. government doing to find them and secure their release?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know we are aware of it, Erica, and we, as you know, strongly urge the governments in the entire region\xc2\xa0 -- in this case, those in Libya -- to protect journalists, allow them to do their work, do not harass or in any way detain or use violence against journalists.\xc2\xa0 We are -- I will refer you to the State Department to efforts that may be undertaken with regard to specific journalists.\xc2\xa0 But our overall stand is very firm that journalists, American journalists, need to be allowed to do their work, not harassed, and not detained.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Raymond Davis, could you clarify as to whether the U.S. did in fact make payments to those families to secure his release?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Erica, the United States welcomes the release of Mr. Davis.\xc2\xa0 He was released under -- he was pardoned, as you understand it, by -- as\xc2\xa0 we all know, by the families involved of the victims and in accordance with Pakistani law.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more information on that for you.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, lawyers for the family members say that the U.S. government paid the family members, or that the Pakistani government paid them and the U.S. government will get a bill.\xc2\xa0 Is that accurate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information that would corroborate that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, is the White House satisfied with the quality and quantity of information coming from Japan about the situation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, yes.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that it is the information that our independent experts are getting in Japan that led to the recommendation by the NRC that American citizens be evacuated beyond a 50-mile radius.\xc2\xa0 It is obviously a very fluid situation and everybody is searching for the most -- the best information available in a crisis situation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the Japanese who have the lead on this, as this is a crisis in their country, are working very hard to get the best information possible.\xc2\xa0 And we are working alongside them to get that information and then evaluate it independently to make the kind of recommendation that NRC Chairman Jaczko made and that the State Department is following.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And are you satisfied with how they\xe2\x80\x99re handling it?\xc2\xa0 Because it seems to be spiraling out of control.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is a crisis situation, Steve.\xc2\xa0 I would remind you that the lead in dealing with the crisis is the Japanese government.\xc2\xa0 We are aiding and assisting in every way we can, and we have a team of people there with a variety of special capabilities.\xc2\xa0 We have offered equipment and we are working with the Japanese who have the lead on this very critical situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more thing, that you said you\xe2\x80\x99ve offered equipment, but have they accepted it?\xc2\xa0 Are they accepting all the U.S. offers for assistance?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned yesterday some of the equipment that they have accepted.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of any offers that have been -- not taken up.\xc2\xa0 So I think that we are working as hard as we can, our experts in Japan, on this and helping the Japanese as best we can, and offering all the technical advice and equipment that we can to help them deal with this situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, why isn\xe2\x80\x99t the United States doing what other big countries in Europe, especially, are doing with their citizens, which is urging that they evacuate Japan?\xc2\xa0 Why keep this incremental situation going?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jill, I would point you to the fact that the NRC, the independent agency that monitors the safety and security of the nuclear reactors in this country, has evaluated the information that it has received and advises that American citizens should evacuate beyond a 50-mile radius.\xc2\xa0 That is the same advice they would give if an incident like this were occurring in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are treating it in that way.\xc2\xa0 The State Department -- I mean, in terms of the kinds of advisories that go out, I refer you to the State Department on how that is handled.\xc2\xa0 But this is based on our independent analysis of the situation there.\xc2\xa0 And we are obviously very concerned about the safety and security of American citizens in Japan, and we urge American citizens in Japan to stay in regular contact with the embassy and consulates in Japan, to check the State Department website regularly, and those citizens who need assistance -- let me just get this for you here -- those citizens that need assistance in evacuating should -- I do have some information here, let me just find it real quick -- can send an email to the embassy to get assistance. The email address is <a href="mailto:japanemergencyusc@state.gov">japanemergencyusc@state.gov</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And U.S. citizens in need of emergency assistance should send an email to that address with detailed information about their location and contact information, and monitor the U.S. Department of State website at travel.state.gov for further information.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the United States would help its citizens to get ot of that area?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, the embassy and the consulates will do everything they can to assist Americans to evacuate that area.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just a point here.\xc2\xa0 Up to now the United States has been saying U.S. citizens should follow the instructions that are coming from the Japanese government.\xc2\xa0 Now it appears that you\'re saying listen to the NRC.\xc2\xa0 Which way is it?\xc2\xa0 I mean, are they --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, this is new information.\xc2\xa0 When the situation was what it was the other day and yesterday, based on the data that the NRC was analyzing, their advice was in agreement with what the Japanese government was saying, and therefore, our advice was the same.\xc2\xa0 And therefore, we told American citizens to follow the instructions of the Japanese government.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are now saying, based on our independent analysis of the deteriorating situation -- we all have watched on television and read about the damage at the various reactors and the potential for emissions -- based on that new information, the new data, the independent analysis, the NRC is now advising an evacuation beyond a 50-mile radius.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So because that -- the advice is no longer in agreement, we are obviously advising American citizens that they listen to the NRC and the State Department.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that raise a big question?\xc2\xa0 I mean, do you still have confidence in what the Japanese government is saying, if you are saying their advice doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure of the nature of your question.\xc2\xa0 We -- the Japanese government -- this is an incident that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Japan.\xc2\xa0 The Japanese government is evaluating the data; we are evaluating it as well, and we are making an independent recommendation for American citizens.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a question of -- again, to make it clear, this crisis is happening in Japan.\xc2\xa0 So obviously the Japanese government has the lead here with regards to dealing with the crisis and advising its people. We have a lot of Americans in Japan, and when the data that we receive is analyzed independently, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to give advice based on our analysis.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that raises the question again --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the question, Jill.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, just to make sure then, does the advice from the United States go beyond what the Japanese are suggesting?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 So if it does, then that means there is a higher level of concern among the Americans about this than among --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is -- again, I will not from here judge the Japanese evaluation of the data.\xc2\xa0 I will simply say, based on our analysis and our expert analysis, this is what we would do if this incident were happening in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And because we have American citizens in Japan, this is the advice that we\xe2\x80\x99re giving American citizens.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not -- it is simply a separate analysis based on American standards that the NRC has and then the advice they would give.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if I were a U.S. citizen in Japan right now, in that area, if I were listening to the Japanese government, I would be staying in certain places rather than leaving.\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that correct?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Which is why we are saying that it is our recommendation that American citizens evacuate beyond a 50-mile radius.\xc2\xa0 And so -- precisely because we believe, based on our analysis, that that is the right course of action, we are issuing this advisory today.\xc2\xa0 The State Department issued it not long ago.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a quick question on Libya?\xc2\xa0 President Sarkozy today said it\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of days, if not hours, for the opposition, that forces of Qaddafi are moving swiftly.\xc2\xa0 You have Ban Ki-moon saying if they move against Benghazi there could be massively dangerous situations for the civilians, putting their lives at risk.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We asked you yesterday, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it appear that it\xe2\x80\x99s over for the opposition, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the opposition.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the citizens who are in Benghazi.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the citizens who could be at risk.\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that raise the flag to do more now than simply say the United Nations should act?\xc2\xa0 But nobody seems to be doing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 In fact, the United Nations is meeting today and crafting a resolution.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State just spoke about this to reporters in Cairo.\xc2\xa0 Ambassador Rice is working very hard with her counterparts at the United Nations on language that would -- hopefully the terms of a resolution would include a range of actions that the international community could take.\xc2\xa0 And we are exploring that and hoping to move very quickly.\xc2\xa0 I will simply cite the Secretary of State who said that she believes -- or rather she hopes, that we will see movement on that no later than tomorrow.<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the international community is moving very quickly.\xc2\xa0 We are, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve noted before, very heartened by the strong statement from the Arab League.\xc2\xa0 We think it is vital for these kinds of actions to be international in nature, and in this region it is vital for the support of nations in the region in order to make it clear that this is not the West or the United States dictating an outcome in a country like Libya, but it is the international community that is making demands and taking action very much in concert with other Arab nations.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, those Americans in Japan who listen to the Japanese government and stay 20 kilometers outside the reactor, and don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to the U.S. government and go 80 kilometers outside the reactor, they are taking risks with their lives that they should not?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are advising -- I think I\'m being clear about this.\xc2\xa0 We are advising, based on new information in a deteriorating and fast-moving situation at a nuclear reactor site in Japan, that American citizens within a 50-mile radius of that plant should evacuate beyond the 50-mile mark.\xc2\xa0 And that is our advice to American citizens.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That recommendation suggests that the information coming from the Japanese government is inadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, it is -- that recommendation suggests that the advice the Japanese government is giving, based on the information it has, is different from the advice that we would be giving if this incident were happening in the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 It is not about the quality of information; it is about the standards set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission here in the United States and the kind of advice it would be giving should this incident happen in the United States, or something similar to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it is, again, not about the quality of information or the level of cooperation; it is about our analysis and our standards --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do we have higher standards?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not about high or low, Jake.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just simply saying that this is our advice based on the information that we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The European Energy Commissioner said today about Japan, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is talk of an apocalypse, and I think the word is particularly well chosen.\xc2\xa0 Practically everything is out of control.\xc2\xa0 I cannot exclude the worst in the hours and days to come.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is going on over there right now?\xc2\xa0 We have not heard the latest in information from the NRC or from the Japanese government.\xc2\xa0 Apparently there has been something that has happened in the last few hours.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it is clearly a crisis.\xc2\xa0 There is clearly --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know it\xe2\x80\x99s deteriorating.\xc2\xa0 But what specifically is going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 I think that you have reporters in Japan.\xc2\xa0 You have reporters, including ones here who could get the technical detailed information on what we know from the NRC, from the Department on Energy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We should rely on the media, not the government?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no.\xc2\xa0 I just referred to two government agencies who can provide technical information about what we know that\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not\xc2\xa0 -- we make no bones about the fact that this is a very serious situation at this nuclear plant.\xc2\xa0 We are concerned enough that we have offered a great deal of assistance to the Japanese, and we have our own experts on the ground both assisting and evaluating information independently for that reason.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a disagreement here about the severity of the situation at all.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the U.S. prepared if Japan needs it for a widespread evacuation of the population -- if it needs it?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the U.S. is prepared to help and assist Japan in any way that it can in dealing with this crisis, with the aftermath of the earthquake, the tsunami, and the crisis unfolding at the reactor.\xc2\xa0 In terms of what that would entail, I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess at this point, but we are prepared to help in any way we can.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is a contingency that the U.S. is prepared to deal with?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xc2\xa0 I said in any way that we can, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I mean, we prepare for contingencies of all kinds, all the time.\xc2\xa0 And we are assisting the government of Japan in any way that we can now, and we will continue to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Chip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I think Jill and Jake were getting at a broader question here that I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure you answered.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the 50-mile issue; it\xe2\x80\x99s issues generally.\xc2\xa0 If you\xe2\x80\x99re telling the American citizens on the ground in Japan that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to Japan but should listen to the NRC and the United States on the issue of 50 miles, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that also suggest they should stop listening to Japan on everything else -- on whether Tokyo is safe, and everything else, and pay attention to what the United States tells them to do?\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they stop listening to Japan officials and listen to the United States now?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I just said -- I think I answered the question that the American citizens in Japan should stay in constant contact with the U.S. embassy, with consulates.\xc2\xa0 They should --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And stop listening to Japan?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xc2\xa0 Should they stop listening to the Japanese government --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- since in this case, that advice was inadequate?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that our advice on this particular issue is different and therefore we are making this advice to the American citizens in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just different.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about people risking their lives by staying too close.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Exactly.\xc2\xa0 Exactly, Chip.\xc2\xa0 And the severity of the situation is such that we\xe2\x80\x99re --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the Japanese advice is inadequate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Their standards are different from ours based on the information we have about how far you should evacuate from the site of this nuclear power plant.\xc2\xa0 American citizens in Japan should closely monitor the Department of State website.\xc2\xa0 They should stay in touch with the embassy.\xc2\xa0 And we have said that for days by --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And should stop following your earlier advice that they should listen to what the Japanese government tells them to do.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I made clear in answer to Jill\xe2\x80\x99s question that this is a break from our early advice because --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But not just on this issue, not just on this issue, but on every issue.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 American citizens are living in Japan and obviously should listen to the government of Japan.\xc2\xa0 They should also listen to and follow the advice of the American State Department, U.S. Department of State, as provided on the website and at the embassy, and follow the recommendations that we make, including the one we\xe2\x80\x99ve put out today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Our people on the ground, CBS people on the ground in Japan, say that there is -- that anger is another thing that\xe2\x80\x99s spiraling out of control toward the Japanese government; that they are becoming increasingly untrustful of what the Japanese government is telling them.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the Japanese government --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Your reporters are?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what they\xe2\x80\x99re hearing from people on the ground in Japan.\xc2\xa0 If the Japanese people are losing confidence in the Japanese government, why should we listen to them and why should U.S. citizens listen to them?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chip, I have just made clear that we have put out an advisory today from the United States Department of State --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not only this issue, on everything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that it makes very clear that we have -- when there is a situation when our advice on what to do in reaction to this incident to protect your physical safety differs from the advice the government of Japan is giving, we will give separate and additional advice to American citizens in Japan.\xc2\xa0 That is true today and it will be true tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 And some days, the advice, when it is in concert, will be the same; and when it is not it will be different.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we are very concerned about the health, safety and security of American citizens living in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could I just -- Secretary Chu today said on Capitol Hill, when he was asked about unfolding events, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are conflicting reports and so we don\xe2\x80\x99t really know in detail what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 Is that an accurate reflection of the President\xe2\x80\x99s --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 It is a crisis at a nuclear power plant with four reactors.\xc2\xa0 And you don\xe2\x80\x99t need me to tell you that the situation has deteriorated in the days since the tsunami and that the situation has grown at times worse, with potential greater damage and fallout from the reactor.\xc2\xa0 And that is why there is new information based on a very fluid situation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when he was asked if he\xe2\x80\x99s satisfied with the Japanese government\xe2\x80\x99s response, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t really say.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Is that what you would say in response to that question?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I defer to the experts; Secretary Chu is one of them.\xc2\xa0 I defer to the NRC.\xc2\xa0 I know that, based on what I\'ve been told, that we are getting cooperation and information from the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 The fact that our analysis may differ on some of what that data means and the actions that we would take does not mean that we have a problem with cooperation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President concerned at what appears to be a tug-of-war between the Saudis and Iran over Bahrain?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as I think I made clear in my readout of his phone calls today to the King of Saudi Arabia and the King of Bahrain, is concerned about the situation in Bahrain, and expressed that concern directly to the King of Bahrain and called on the government there to follow the national dialogue initiative that was -- is being led by the Bahraini Crown Prince.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He believes -- as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, and he expressed this to those two leaders, as he has to others in the region -- that there is no military solution to the problems in Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 There is no means of violence that will solve the unrest in the region, in any country; and that the future of those countries will be immeasurably brighter if the governments there engage in a political dialogue with the people, allow for a democratic transition, precisely in order to answer the legitimate aspirations and grievances of their people so that those countries can thrive politically and economically in the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But does he believe that the Saudis and Iran are butting heads over Bahrain?\xc2\xa0 And with the strategic interests the U.S. has in both Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, is he concerned about the conflict between those two?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think his concern about Bahrain is what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that the government of Bahrain needs to show restraint in its dealing with the people there, and that all sides need to show restraint, to refrain from violence, and to engage in a dialogue.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that that is the right course for the government of Bahrain and it\xe2\x80\x99s the right course for the governments in the region.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I can ask you about the transparency award the President is receiving today.\xc2\xa0 The AP has a report that indicates FOIA requests were up last year but action was taken in fewer cases and agencies took longer, in fact, to give out records.\xc2\xa0 So, if I could, how has the President earned a transparency award?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, as you know -- and I assume you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your tongue stuck firmly in your cheek when you ask that question -- this President has demonstrated a commitment to transparency and openness that is greater than any administration has shown in the past, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been committed to that since he ran for President and he\xe2\x80\x99s taken a significant number of measures to demonstrate that.\xc2\xa0 And this is not an award that he is -- that we are giving to him or he is giving to himself.\xc2\xa0 This is an award from an outside organization that has recognized the achievements this administration has made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I mean, I can provide you the details.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of FOIA requests, the fact is, is that we have -- federal agencies in this administration, under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership and directives, have disclosed more information and withheld less information in response to FOIA requests, precisely because of the directives that this President has made.\xc2\xa0 And we believe, the President believes, that greater openness and transparency strengthens our democracy, promotes efficiency and effectiveness in government, and he will continue to pursue the initiatives that he believes very much are in the interests in the American people.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the AP.\xc2\xa0 George Washington University also released a study this week and the conclusion was that federal agencies are about halfway to where the President asked them to be, and the author of the study said maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll get there by the end of the President\xe2\x80\x99s first term.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President set -- again, we can, separately, if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, go through all the data that covers FOIA requests. That the President set a very high standard for openness and transparency, I will concede, and that he has asked his government to pursue and achieve that standard, I will also concede.\xc2\xa0 What I will not concede is that his record on this issue is anything but exemplary.\xc2\xa0 And it is because of his commitment to the issues of openness and transparency that he is receiving this award.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be committed to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mike.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that Secretary Chu described the situation in Japan as a partial meltdown today and that there are conflicting reports, says Secretary Chu, that several reactors are now at risk, and given the updated advisories about the evacuations that you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined here, is there thought being given here to postponing the Latin America trip?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We still very much plan to take the trip.\xc2\xa0 I just want to emphasize with all --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are leaving on schedule on Friday.\xc2\xa0 It bears repeating that this is a crisis -- there is no question about it. And it is a crisis in Japan.\xc2\xa0 It is not a crisis in the United States.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about our allies and friends, the Japanese.\xc2\xa0 We are doing everything we can to help and assist them.\xc2\xa0 We are very concerned about the safety and security of American citizens in Japan, and we are doing everything we can to ensure their safety.\xc2\xa0 But it is -- we have no plans to change the trip.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it under consideration, a postponement?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I mean, somebody asked me yesterday, could an event occur that would cause you to postpone a trip?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s like asking could an asteroid fall from the sky.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me ask you this.\xc2\xa0 The discrepancy --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can an asteroid fall from the sky?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was classified.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The discrepancy between a 20-mile evacuation zone that the Japanese government has recommended and the 50-mile evacuation zone that the American government is now recommending for its own citizens.\xc2\xa0 Was there thought, any concern that that might incite a panic among Japanese citizens who live between 50 and 20 miles?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We consulted with the Japanese government.\xc2\xa0 They were fully aware that we would be making this recommendation and sending out this advisory.\xc2\xa0 Our concern obviously is with, first and foremost, the safety and security of American citizens and we issued the advisory accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the discrepancy due to perhaps logistic challenges in evacuating millions or perhaps hundreds of thousands of Japanese and just a handful of Americans?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, you should ask the Japanese government those questions.\xc2\xa0 The issue here is our decision based on our analysis of the data we have.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And final question:\xc2\xa0 Is it entirely appropriate for the President to be addressing a crisis of this gravity as he\xe2\x80\x99s standing before a white board talking about a basketball tournament?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There are crises all the time and for every President.\xc2\xa0 And again, this one is happening halfway around the world, and it is severe and it is important and it is the focus of a great deal of the President\xe2\x80\x99s attention -- as are the events in the Middle East; as are the agenda items that he is pursuing to grow the economy and increase jobs in America, make sure we out-innovate, out-build and out-educate the competition in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard job that requires a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is also important -- one of the things I would note that the President did in that very brief interview on ESPN and ESPN2 was ask Americans, as they were filling out their own brackets, take the time to go to usaid.gov and make donations to a variety of charitable organizations that are organizing donations to help the Japanese in this very serious situation that they find themselves in.\xc2\xa0 And so, yes, I do think it was appropriate.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions.\xc2\xa0 What should the Japanese citizens within -- or between the 20 and 50 miles, what should they think of the U.S. recommendation?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I just answered that question.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously for the Japanese government.\xc2\xa0 They have the lead.\xc2\xa0 This is a crisis in their country.\xc2\xa0 Our advisory they were putting out today is based on our independent analysis of the data and our concern for American citizens.\xc2\xa0 It is the advice that we would give to Americans living within a 50-mile radius of a nuclear power plant that was experiencing a similar series of problems that this power plant is experiencing, and that is why we issued the advisory.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, Elizabeth Warren is up on the Hill, and some Republican lawmakers are, I guess, grumbling at the amount of power that she has at the Consumer Protection Bureau and wondering where is a permanent director.\xc2\xa0 Where is the President\xe2\x80\x99s search for a permanent director?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to give you an update on personnel search --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he actively considering it?\xc2\xa0 Or he is still looking for a director?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, yes, he is, obviously.\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed that and -- so he fully intends to find a permanent director.\xc2\xa0 Elizabeth Warren is --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anytime soon?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what we said about that, but it is in the relatively near future.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an announcement on when that will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the issue you raised in the beginning, the President signed into law a Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a law that puts rules of the road in place to help prevent another financial crisis -- a crisis, by the way, that cost millions of American jobs -- and this act includes the strongest consumer protections in American history.\xc2\xa0 He feels that this is vitally important that we have an independent watchdog.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you should know that Elizabeth Warren has met with all stakeholders, from consumer advocates to CEOs of large financial institutions, to members of Congress, and has had an open comment process on the bureau\xe2\x80\x99s website so every American can contribute his or her ideas to this process.\xc2\xa0 But he is committed to this because he thinks consumers deserve protection in the wake of what was an historic financial crisis that led to the greatest recession this country has seen since the Great Depression and cost millions of Americans their jobs.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And Republicans are saying that the bureau needs more oversight, particularly congressional oversight.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House agree with that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The law contains within it a great deal of oversight.\xc2\xa0 The whole point of the creation of the bureau was to consolidate authorities scattered across government to create real accountability.\xc2\xa0 And if you look closely, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that there are actually -- there will be more oversight and accountability of the CFPB than there is of any other federal banking regulator.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we are confident that there is substantial and sufficient oversight.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Helene.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Clinton spoke today, and you did as well, about a range of actions at the U.N., including a no-fly zone on Libya.\xc2\xa0 But a no-fly zone on Bosnia was ineffective in stopping the mass murders of Srebrenica, mass rape or ethnic cleanings.\xc2\xa0 A no-drive zone is not going to be effective because the tanks in Libya are already so widely dispersed.\xc2\xa0 It would have had to have been done a month ago.\xc2\xa0 And arming the rebels with money would take another few months before -- and they\xe2\x80\x99ve got days at this point.\xc2\xa0 So when you guys talk about a range of options, what exactly are you talking about that could conceivably or realistically stop Qaddafi at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get ahead of the outcome of the consultations at the Security Council today and that will help shape the packages that Secretary Clinton referred to.\xc2\xa0 But it is precisely because there needs to be a range of options and a range of actions that the international community can take that these consultations are dealing with more than just the no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 It is one of the options on the table, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve said repeatedly and others have, but there are other options that need to be considered so that we can be sure that the actions we are taking with our international partners will do the most possible to put pressure on Qaddafi and to ultimately get him to leave power.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up on that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it the belief of the White House that a no-fly zone could still make a military difference on the ground at this point?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the military analysis to the experts.\xc2\xa0 As I said, no-fly zone option remains actively considered.\xc2\xa0 It is certainly being considered as part of a package of actions that might be taken in a resolution that emerges from the Security Council.\xc2\xa0 We believe that, as part of any actions taken, that strong Arab League support and participation is vital, as the Secretary of State and others have made clear.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to assess the effectiveness of each individual option that is being considered.\xc2\xa0 I have said from here before, as others have said, that it is important that the options we take, that we understand what their effectiveness can be and what their limitations will be.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why do we need more support than the Arab League?\xc2\xa0 The Arab League has already invited us to do this.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right, and that happened -- that was over the weekend, right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that was two days ago --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And today is Wednesday and we\'re expecting some sort of action on this no later than tomorrow.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But this is a -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a fast-moving war.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, if a resolution --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How could he be accused of being imperialist if the region is inviting us in to help out?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well said.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I will add that the expectation that the Secretary of State expressed moments ago in Cairo that we might have action on this no later than tomorrow again demonstrates the remarkable sense of urgency that this administration has been guided by and our national partners have been guided by.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more final thing.\xc2\xa0 You frequently talk about what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done and the rapidity of the things that we have done.\xc2\xa0 How have any of those actions that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken affected military matters in a positive way for the rebels on the ground?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to prove a negative, Keith, right?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the fact that the actions we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken have --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 Do we feel that they have done anything to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an arms embargo.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an asset freeze.\xc2\xa0 There are efforts undertaken to prevent mercenaries from traveling into Libya.\xc2\xa0 There are a host of actions, including humanitarian assistance, that have had an impact on the event there.\xc2\xa0 I understand -- the events there.\xc2\xa0 I understand that it is still -- we are still not in a place where we are happy with what\xe2\x80\x99s happening.\xc2\xa0 The violence is abhorrent.\xc2\xa0 It is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And the international community has spoken very clearly about that.\xc2\xa0 But the actions that have been taken have been significant, they have been highly coordinated, and they are not the last actions that we or our international partners will take.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually helped the rebels, those actions?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You should ask them.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Ann.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Do you know whether during the NRC chairman meeting that it was raised at all that at some point the American embassy may ask Americans to -- or suggest Americans leave Japan, or reduce the embassy staff size in Tokyo?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that anything like that was discussed.\xc2\xa0 Again, this is a fluid situation.\xc2\xa0 As information comes, I would point you to the State Department on any advisories it might have.\xc2\xa0 The advisory that I spoke about at the top of this briefing is -- the ink is still not dry on it.\xc2\xa0 So that is our current advice to American citizens in Japan.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I ask it because some of our colleagues are in the airports there in Tokyo and it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to get out.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the flights are not -- there are fewer flights coming to take people out to places.\xc2\xa0 It looks like a campground, they say, with the people camped out trying to get flights out of the country.\xc2\xa0 And if you were to ask Americans or recommend that Americans might consider leaving, it would take more than just a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice to get them out.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to quibble with that, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate about what may or may not happen if we were to take some other action that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you tell us how similar are the nuclear plants in Japan versus the nuclear plants here in America?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not know enough to responsibly reply to that.\xc2\xa0 I urge you to discuss -- to raise that question with the NRC and the Department of Energy, and there are a lot of independent experts out there who could probably answer that question better than I can.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the President getting that kind of information?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, so --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But the experts, one of whom I had here the other day, are much better suited to answer that.\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to give you bad information from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And also, with contradiction in information from the Japanese government and the United States government, is it time for common sense just to set in to say we need to leave this area, and not worry about what the governments are saying -- it\xe2\x80\x99s about self-preservation at this time?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will point you to the advisory that the State Department has just issued to American citizens in Japan.\xc2\xa0 That is the advice of the United States government to American citizens.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond that.\xc2\xa0 I will simply point you to it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But don\xe2\x80\x99t you agree self-preservation goes beyond what our government --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I will point you to --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- two governments are fighting over?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to go beyond what the -- first of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you just said about fighting over -- we\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting over anything.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not fighting, but there are two contradictory reports about how far people should leave.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is the advice that we are giving to American citizens, based on data that we have analyzed independently.\xc2\xa0 Beyond the advisory given by the State Department I will not go.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two questions.\xc2\xa0 I know this seems pass\xc3\xa9, but the CR, you know -- (laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering whether President Obama is going to personally engage on this right now, or whether the three weeks buy him a little bit of time personally to take a break until he\xe2\x80\x99s back from Brazil?\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden I know was talking (inaudible) today.\xc2\xa0 So I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you can kind of be as specific as possible about what will happen over the next three weeks and with whom?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll quickly toss out my second question.\xc2\xa0 The First Amendment advocates who will present the President with this award are not -- they\xe2\x80\x99re not entirely happy with everyone you\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xc2\xa0 I think one of their big concerns in continuation of the state secret (inaudible.)\xc2\xa0 Will there be a time when he sits down and talks with them -- not on award day -- about some of their concerns?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Margaret, I addressed our position on the overall actions that the President has taken towards openness and transparency.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On your first question on the CR, I mean, we obviously support the passage of the three-week CR, precisely because we need the time to negotiate a final CR for fiscal year 2011.\xc2\xa0 And I think what will happen during this period is what has already happened, which are serious high-level consultations and discussions and negotiations about what that package would look like, and how it must contain within it serious spending cuts, which everybody agrees are necessary, but which almost maintains the investments in those areas that are so vital to our future economic growth, which the President has specified -- education, infrastructure and innovation.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you think this is probably the last CR?\xc2\xa0 Some Republicans have suggested --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have made clear, Margaret, that we do not think it is healthy for the American economy, and therefore it is not good for the American people to treat this situation like a tollbooth, where every two or three weeks you pay your money and you get to pass through the toll.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s not the way we should be running a government; it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way the American citizens expect us to.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we believe that there is common ground here and we\xe2\x80\x99re confident that we can work together on a funding for the fiscal year in a package that we can all live with, where everybody gives, everybody moves off their starting position, and then we can get that done and move on to address the other issues that are very important that are on -- and I will point to you that among those is fiscal year 2012, where the President of the United States remains the only player to have put forward a detailed budget that cuts spending and reduces the deficit.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sam.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wonder -- which one?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, which one?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Guy in the blue shirt.\xc2\xa0 Oh -- (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I just wanted to follow.\xc2\xa0 On the budget negotiations -- which we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing revolts within the House Republican Party -- does the White House view Speaker Boehner as somebody who can deliver on whatever he promises at the negotiating table?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we believe that Speaker Boehner is Speaker of the House and he\xe2\x80\x99s the leader of the Republican Party in the House.\xc2\xa0 And we are negotiating with him.\xc2\xa0 We are negotiating with Senator McConnell, with Senator Reid, and Leader Pelosi, as well as others -- appropriators on the CR and others that are involved in this process.\xc2\xa0 And I think what I said applies to everyone in this debate, everybody involved in these negotiations, and in some ways that includes every member of Congress -- to get a resolution for the American people, to get the work done that they want done, everybody needs to move off their starting position.\xc2\xa0 Everybody needs to accept -- to give a little, in order to achieve the kind of spending reductions that we all believe are necessary and the kind of investments that we all believe are vital to the economic growth that this country needs to compete and win the future in the 21st century.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the fact that at the end of this process, no one will get 100 percent of what they want.\xc2\xa0 I will stipulate that right here. And that is true of the President and it will be true of every -- probably every member of Congress.\xc2\xa0 But that\'s what negotiating and finding common ground is all about.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam number two.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two-part question.\xc2\xa0 First on the CR --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I like that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m number one.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 On the CR, in this three-week stopgap measure there is, as I understand it, $99 million cut on NOAA funding, which the National Weather Services warn would affect tsunami detection capabilities.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House comfortable signing a bill at this juncture that could potentially affect how we detect tsunami warnings?\xc2\xa0 And I have a follow-up after that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You have a follow-up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, on a different question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sam, I think we have generally stipulated that the spending cuts in the measure are ones that we can live with. On the specifics that you are asking about I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to -- I can take that question.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wait for you to get back.\xc2\xa0 The second one has to do with the hearings that General Petraeus has had on Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talked a lot about the upward trajectory there, but that the gains we\xe2\x80\x99ve made are fragile and reversible, is the quote he gave.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday we saw another prominent Republican official, Haley Barbour, come out with his skepticism of Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 We see public polls showing an increased skepticism in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration at all worried that the gains that they\'re making, as fragile and reversible as they are, won\xe2\x80\x99t outlast the public\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to support this war?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sam, as you know the President went through a very deliberative process to arrive at the policy decision he made that we are executing now in Afghanistan and about which General Petraeus has been testifying on the Hill this week.\xc2\xa0 He believes it is important to our national security interests to execute on that policy.\xc2\xa0 He also believes that a major element of this policy is the beginning of the withdrawal of U.S. forces in July of 2011, as I think General Petraeus also discussed in his testimony -- which will lead to a process that by the end of 2014 will mean that the United States forces will have turned security lead over to Afghan security forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we understand that this is a long war, and the policy of the President devised with his advisors and commanders is aimed at achieving the success that we need and drawing down our forces once those successes have been achieved and as we transition authority to Afghan security forces.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But are you worried about the waning popularity in the country for continued deployment even to 2014?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I think we understand the environment.\xc2\xa0 We understand how long this war has gone on.\xc2\xa0 We understand, as the President said, that this war was neglected for a number of years in the middle of the last decade.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- this was all part of the President\xe2\x80\x99s review that led him to the policy decision he made.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way back to Cheryl.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President is yet interviewing for Commerce Secretary?\xc2\xa0 And what do you have to say to Senator McConnell who\xe2\x80\x99s vowed to hold that nomination until the Colombia and Panama free trade agreements come up?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Cheryl, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to guess that -- and I know I\xe2\x80\x99m relatively new to this job -- that my predecessor -- not just my immediate predecessor but none of my predecessors -- ever discussed interviews the President might have been doing about personnel.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have anything for you on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What I will tell you is that we strongly believe that the American people do not expect the kind of political games that holding up important appointments represents when this President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to trade deals, fair trade deals has been demonstrated by his approach with the deal with South Korea, where because he did not feel it was strong enough for American workers and American businesses, he left South Korea without a deal, went back to the negotiating table and produced a deal that now has the support of labor and business and is good for the American economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taking with Panama and Colombia. And as Ambassador Kirk has said publicly, we are focused very aggressively on finishing those deals, but we do not believe it is good for the economy.\xc2\xa0 We do not believe the American people expect those kind of political games around something so important as the approval of a trade deal that has wide support and will lead to job creating in the United States.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me take one more.\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, two.\xc2\xa0 One on Japan and one on the CR, please.\xc2\xa0 On Japan, the European Union and several East Asian countries have said that there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be extra scrutiny for food imports from Japan.\xc2\xa0 Is the United States prepared to do anything on food imports or other imports to check for radiation or other levels?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you should know that the agencies that check food imports do that every day, and of course are aware of what has happened in Japan and will be checking food accordingly. So the agency that ensures the safety of food imports will continue its work.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to what I said about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\xc2\xa0 Prior to the events in Japan, the safety and security of American reactors was the primary mission of the NRC.\xc2\xa0 It is that today and it will be that next week and into the future.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the CR, Jay, the Democratic leaders, including the Majority Leader yesterday in the Senate, Harry Reid, said that the Tea Party is -- basically looking to the Tea Party as forming a wedge here on the CR negotiations.\xc2\xa0 Is the President meeting separately with any Tea Party leaders in the House caucus or the Senate caucus on the continuing resolution hoping to get one through the end of the fiscal year?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say the President has had conversations and meetings that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.\xc2\xa0 In terms of internal party politics and the Republican Party, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to analyze that from here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 2:44 P.M.
