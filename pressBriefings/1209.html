Brady Press Briefing Room\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t12:50 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Before we get started with questions let me just make a couple of announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Later this afternoon the President is scheduled to call Prime Minister Key of New Zealand and reiterate our nation\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to assist in the rescue and recovery efforts in the aftermath of the recent earthquake there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I also just wanted to run through a few economic announcements.\xc2\xa0 First, you should have all received a release listing the members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.\xc2\xa0 The first meeting of the new council will take place tomorrow at the White House at 1:45 p.m.\xc2\xa0 There will be pool spray coverage of the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks at the top of the meeting and the meeting will be live-streamed at <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">www.whitehouse.gov</a>.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Also today, Austan Goolsbee will hold a conference call at 3:00 p.m. to discuss the Economic Report of the President, which will be released later this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 During that call, Austan will also announce the President\xe2\x80\x99s intent to nominate Carl Shapiro to be a new member at the Council of Economic Advisers.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Could you walk us through how the President\xe2\x80\x99s position on the Defense of Marriage Act has evolved and how he made his decision to order the Justice Department to no longer defend its constitutionality?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s position on the Defense of Marriage Act has been consistent.\xc2\xa0 He has long opposed it as unnecessary and unfair.\xc2\xa0 Separate from that, or distinct from that is the decision that was announced today which was brought on by a court-imposed deadline, by the Second Circuit, that required a decision by the administration about whether or not this case should require heightened scrutiny, a heightened constitutional review -- because this -- unlike the other cases in other circuits, there was no precedent, no foundation upon which the administration could defend the Defense of Marriage Act, in this case.\xc2\xa0 Therefore it had to basically make a positive assertion about its constitutionality.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The Attorney General recommended that the higher level of scrutiny be applied and under that higher level of scrutiny deemed or recommended that it be viewed as unconstitutional.\xc2\xa0 The President reviewed that recommendation and concurred.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, again, because of the court-imposed deadline and the necessity that this decision be made, our announcement was made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But by making that decision is the President saying that he believes that marriage does not necessarily have to be between a man and a woman, that that cannot be constitutionally imposed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s personal view on same-sex marriage I think you all have heard him discuss as recently as a press conference at the end of last year.\xc2\xa0 That is distinct from this legal decision.\xc2\xa0 And he, again -- the Attorney General and the President were under a court-imposed deadline to make a decision in this case, and they did.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd the President -- let me make a couple of points about it.\xc2\xa0 The decision is that we will -- the administration will not defend the Defense of Marriage Act in the Second Circuit.\xc2\xa0 Furthermore, the President directed the Attorney General not to defend, because of the decision that it\xe2\x80\x99s not constitutional, defend the Defense of Marriage Act in any other circuit, in any other case.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me also make clear, however, that the United States government will still be a party to those cases in order to allow those cases to proceed so that the courts can make the final determination about its constitutionality, and also, so that other interested parties are able to take up the defense of the Defense of Marriage Act if they so wish -- and in particular, Congress or members of Congress who want to proceed and defend the law in these cases.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe administration will do everything it can to assist Congress if it so wishes to do that.\xc2\xa0 We recognize and respect that there are other points of view and other opinions about this.\xc2\xa0 It is also important to note that the enforcement of the Defense of Marriage Act continues -- the President is constitutionally bound to enforce the laws and enforcement of the DOMA will continue.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I guess this raises questions, though, given that the President said his own personal position is evolving.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us where his position on gay marriage stands at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you just to his fairly recent statements on that.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s grappling with the issue, but he -- again, I want to make the distinction between his personal views, which he has discussed, and the legal issue, the legal decision that was made today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tLet me move on.\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Libya, the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction has been fairly muted and low-key in terms of what he said publicly about it.\xc2\xa0 And I was wondering if you could explain that.\xc2\xa0 When the Egypt unrest was occurring he made several public statements.\xc2\xa0 Does he plan to make any public statements on Libya?\xc2\xa0 And what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, what\xe2\x80\x99s driving the decision to be more low-key on this?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just say that the President strongly condemns, and condemned in a statement on Friday, the violence, the bloodshed perpetuated by the Libyan government in Libya.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State has strongly condemned what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will be meeting with Secretary Clinton, his regular meeting with the Secretary of State, this afternoon.\xc2\xa0 We will have some announcements out of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 The President will address this issue either later this afternoon or tomorrow, so you will hear from the President relatively soon on Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut let me step back and, again, make the point that this administration has very strongly condemned what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in Libya.\xc2\xa0 The violence is abhorrent.\xc2\xa0 It is completely unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And the bloodshed must stop.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This administration has made that clear.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve made it clear both through the statements of the President and the Secretary of State; also through our work very closely with the United Nations Security Council, their very strong statement, which I\'m sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve all read, of which we are a party.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to work with the U.N. in reviewing various options for actions that can be taken to compel Libya to stop, to end this terrible bloodshed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are steps like a no-fly zone under consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A lot of options are under review.\xc2\xa0 Sanctions, other options.\xc2\xa0 But I also want to make clear that we -- our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we are also focused, as I think many of you know, on the safety of American citizens who are in Libya.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very high priority for this administration, the safety of American citizens, and we\xe2\x80\x99re making sure that those Americans are able to be evacuated.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you articulate a policy that the Obama administration has for the sweeping wave of protests that are breaking out in North African and Middle Eastern countries?\xc2\xa0 Obviously, as has been said by your administration many times, nobody could have predicted that all this was going to happen.\xc2\xa0 But certainly the President and administrations long before this President have been articulating the need for democracy and political reform.\xc2\xa0 Is there a plan in place here?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a policy, Jake, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about this.\xc2\xa0 And what is important about this policy is that it does apply to every country in the region.\xc2\xa0 First of all, violence against peaceful protesters is unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 The rights, the universal rights of the citizens, the peoples of these countries, must be respected:\xc2\xa0 the right to peaceful assembly, the right to free speech, the right to access to information.\xc2\xa0 And the need for reform is paramount.\xc2\xa0 These are principles that the President has enunciated when he\xe2\x80\x99s talked about every country in the region that\xe2\x80\x99s experienced unrest.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Those are certainly the principles that he has consistently articulated, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not really necessarily a policy for what to do in this country, what to do in that country, this country.\xc2\xa0 Egypt has a functioning military; Libya has a complete vacuum, a lack of infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Is there a policy for not just beliefs that the President holds or America holds, but steps that the country will take, given unrest in various countries?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the principles guide the policy.\xc2\xa0 And you are right to note that each country is different.\xc2\xa0 The President has made that point.\xc2\xa0 Every country is different; every country has a different tradition, different institutions and a different relationship, in some cases, with the United States.\xc2\xa0 But it is important that those overall principles guide our actions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd what I would say is that in each case, we are guided by the principles and also by the fact that the unrest, the demonstration by the peoples of these countries of their desire for greater political -- greater access to the political system, greater freedom, for rights -- we support.\xc2\xa0 We support those aspirations of those peoples.\xc2\xa0 And we are -- but we are not dictating outcomes and we are not telling the people of any country who their leaders should be or should not be.\xc2\xa0 That is up to the people of Libya to decide, just as it is up to the people of Egypt to decide.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it fair to call this policy as it\xe2\x80\x99s formulated ad hoc or ad-libbed?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think quite the contrary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been -- there is a very clear set of principles that guide the policy.\xc2\xa0 And I think that when you talk about broad policies in the foreign policy arena, the ones that are not ad hoc are the ones that are guided by a broad set of principles and not situation specific or country specific -- which is not to say, as I said, that how we handle or react or act proactively with regard to the situation in every country doesn\xe2\x80\x99t differ depending on the country, because we obviously want -- we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for positive outcomes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one final question.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but just -- you guys are prepared, you have a policy for if this were to happen in Jordan, if this were to happen in Saudi Arabia, if there were to happen in Morocco?\xc2\xa0 You have plans for all of these different countries?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what you mean by plans, but we would be -- without speculating on what might happen, our policies -- our policy in the region and towards the unrest we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in these countries has been consistent and would apply going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if there is a clear set of principles, why has the President chosen to not enunciate them for several days now?\xc2\xa0 The last statement was from you on Friday not from -- it was the President\xe2\x80\x99s words, but delivered by you on Air Force One.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President, when he comes out and makes a statement -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re saying he might do it later today, maybe tomorrow -- in the meantime, hundreds of people have been killed in Libya, so why has he chosen to not enunciate those very principles you say are clear?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was merely a vehicle for that statement.\xc2\xa0 The President puts out statements on paper sometimes. I happened to be on Air Force One and read it aloud, but it was also put out and disseminated everywhere.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s been in front of a microphone several times in the last few days --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And he will be -- he will be, as I said, Ed, either this afternoon or tomorrow on this issue.\xc2\xa0 I think that the Secretary of State has been quite forceful in her condemnation, as was the President on Friday, and Ambassador Rice in New York at the United Nations.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any mystery about our position here, and our forceful condemnation of the violence that has been perpetrated by the Libyan government against its people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he more cautious because of what you said about the Americans who are on the ground in Libya?\xc2\xa0 Is that a key driving force here -- to make sure that they\'re safe?\xc2\xa0 And if he went out there and spoke, it might backfire?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President is obviously concerned about the safety of American citizens, no question.\xc2\xa0 And that is an important factor in any country.\xc2\xa0 And the circumstances of American citizens are different in each country -- the protections they have, say, at the embassy might be different in one country than the protections they have in another.\xc2\xa0 All of those factors are important in how we approach these situations and how the President looks at them.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also extremely concerned and alarmed by the horrific violence and bloodshed that\'s happened in Libya.\xc2\xa0 And we have made that clear, and he will make that clear, as I said, this afternoon or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 There are now obviously various Libyan officials who are leaving the Qaddafi government, and one of them has come forward to say that he believes he has evidence that Qaddafi himself ordered the Pan Am bombing in 1988, which obviously is of great interest to the American people -- large loss of life, huge terror attack.\xc2\xa0 What does the administration make of those reports?\xc2\xa0 Are you doing anything to verify them?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I don\'t have anything on that for you.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we\'re focused right now on the events that are unfolding in Libya, how we can work together with our partners internationally to take the kind of steps that will bring about the end of the bloodshed, and the protection of the rights of the citizens, the people of Libya, and also the protection of American citizens still in Libya.\xc2\xa0 So I don\'t have anything for you specifically on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you tell us what will be the determining factor on whether we hear from the President today or tomorrow?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Just one second.\xc2\xa0 This is just a scheduling issue.\xc2\xa0 As I said, the President will meet with Secretary of State Clinton this afternoon, his regular meeting, and they will obviously discuss Libya.\xc2\xa0 We will have something to say out of that meeting.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s possible the President will speak this afternoon or tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But I assume we\'ll have information on when that will happen fairly soon for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Might it be about U.S. diplomatic relations with Libya?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate on what goes into decisions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s schedule on when he will make a statement.\xc2\xa0 But I just wanted you to know, because I anticipated questions about this, that the President will be addressing this issue in the near future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 And on a government shutdown, is it the White House belief there won\'t be a shutdown starting March 5th?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is our belief, the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief, that the Congress, the congressional leaders, and certainly -- have said and we have said that we believe there is the strong potential there for us to reach an agreement to avoid what you call the government shutdown.\xc2\xa0 And I think -- again, I would point you to comments made by the House and Senate leaders, including the Speaker of the House and the Senate Minority Leader, about their desire to avoid a shutdown.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s driven by the same reasoning that we adhere to, which is an outcome like a government shutdown would have harmful effects on our economy, would set back our economic recovery, would potentially reduce our job and reduce our job-creation efforts.\xc2\xa0 And that is the focus that this President has every day.\xc2\xa0 And I believe there was a study, a Goldman Sachs study, that pointed -- sort of spelled out and analyzed the potential impacts that a government shutdown might have on the economy.\xc2\xa0 And we obviously, like the leaders of Congress, want to avoid that, and we believe we can.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the White House engaged in negotiations on a new CR, a short-term CR?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Mark, what I can say is that, as the President has said and others, we are very interested in sitting down with -- talking with leaders of Congress of both parties, and we have been obviously in discussions with them.\xc2\xa0 Some of those meetings here you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of.\xc2\xa0 The process is a congressional process. And the House has acted; the Senate has to act.\xc2\xa0 There are other steps that have to be decided between the House and the Senate, but we are certainly participating in a process and, again, are optimistic that decisions can be made to resolve this without harmful effects to our economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the ferry that was chartered to evacuate U.S. diplomats and other foreign nationals from Libya left yet?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting for before the President comments on the situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a scheduling issue, Wendell.\xc2\xa0 The President will speak on the issue, as I said in answer to other questions.\xc2\xa0 The safety of American citizens is obviously of concern to the President, as it should be.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is it our feeling that the Libyans have been cooperative about that ferry, or have actually not been so?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I can just simply say that, as you know and as has been discussed, we have been arranging the evacuation of American citizens, but beyond that, I\'m not going to comment on levels of cooperation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much influence does the U.S. have with Libya\xe2\x80\x99s opposition, do you think?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With -- sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Libyan opposition, the opponents of Qaddafi?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue for us, for the United States, again, is to enunciate our clear principles and to make also -- make it clear as we did in Egypt and elsewhere that the drivers of change in these countries -- and this applies to Libya -- are the people -- in this case, the people of Libya.\xc2\xa0 Our principles are very clear about what we -- what our position is:\xc2\xa0 that governments should never use -- that there should not be any kind of use of violence against peaceful protesters; that the aspirations -- legitimate aspirations of the people of Libya should be recognized and responded to; and that the universal freedom -- sorry, the universal rights of the Libyan people need to be recognized and upheld.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s how I would answer that question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple more questions.\xc2\xa0 Does the President support Senator Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s call for reimposition of sanctions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wendell, we are looking at a variety of proposals, including Senator Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s.\xc2\xa0 And again, we are eager to work with our international partners to take the kind of actions that will be effective in bringing the Libyan government to the point where it will cease the violence and end the bloodshed and stop the incredibly abhorrent actions it\xe2\x80\x99s taken against its own people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And separately --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me add -- go ahead, but I do want to move on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an Al-Quds report that says that Hosni Mubarak refused to take a phone call from President Obama.\xc2\xa0 Can you respond to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that, no.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This issue of policy versus principles in the Middle East -- so American foreign policy has not changed, the President\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy in the Middle East has not changed at all, or it\xe2\x80\x99s not changing, it\xe2\x80\x99s not --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, circumstances in the Middle East have changed dramatically -- in many ways, more dramatically in the last four to five weeks than they have in our adult lives.\xc2\xa0 But the principles the President enunciated as far back and prior to -- but as far back most clearly in his speech in Cairo are the same principles that are guiding his --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say we are in the midst of sort of changing, reworking our Middle East policy?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to say that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that the policy, that the principles that guide the policy -- the principles that guide our day-to-day decisions about how we handle these circumstances have not changed.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, the speech -- if you look at the speech and the text of the speech that the President delivered in Cairo, you can find the clear lines that you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing today from this podium and from the President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sure.\xc2\xa0 But the emphasis -- there\xe2\x80\x99s clear principles and there\xe2\x80\x99s how much you let those principles influence your policy on Egypt at the time in your dealings with Mubarak and things like that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the principles very strongly influence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it now influencing in a stronger way now than it did six months ago?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the circumstances have changed, so -- but what I would say about the principles enunciated in Cairo are that they recognized the circumstance in the region whereby there were a lot of people whose universal rights weren\xe2\x80\x99t respected, and that that, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said in other ways, could lead to unrest; and that stability in the region will come with reforms that recognize the universal rights of the people and respond to the aspirations --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So would it be fair to say our policies may change, for instance, in Saudi Arabia because we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be emphasizing these principles a little bit more?\xc2\xa0 Or are you saying --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\'t accept the premise.\xc2\xa0 I think the principles have been consistent, and the decisions that policymakers have made have been guided by those principles throughout this process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Budget shutdown.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us the interaction the White House is having right now?\xc2\xa0 Who at the White House is having interaction with leaders on Capitol Hill?\xc2\xa0 Can you give us a little bit of background?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give you a play-by-play on our meetings.\xc2\xa0 I would direct you to the answer I think I gave to Mark, which is that we are interested in engaging and we have --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you active in negotiations?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to characterize the kind of conversations, and I would point you to the fact that this is a process, obviously, that needs to take place on Capitol Hill that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can you at least describe the level of involvement that the White House is in?\xc2\xa0 I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re not simply an observer, right?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chuck, I would point you to the public --\xc2\xa0 well, I mean, I observe these meetings.\xc2\xa0 But the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Meaning the White House.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we participate.\xc2\xa0 I mean, look, you know about some of the meetings that have happened.\xc2\xa0 But I am not going to come up here every day with a list of meetings that happened yesterday or are going to happen tomorrow, because the focus here is on results.\xc2\xa0 The focus is on coming to an agreement.\xc2\xa0 And we do not believe that reading out every meeting or --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not asking for every meeting, but just characterize the level of --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The House Republican leadership has been here. Senator McConnell has been here.\xc2\xa0 The House Democratic leadership has been here.\xc2\xa0 There have been meetings with Senate Democratic leaders.\xc2\xa0 I mean, these -- we have been engaged in this process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thank you.\xc2\xa0 First of all, congratulations from here to there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions -- one on the Middle East and one on India.\xc2\xa0 As far as Middle East is concerned, how much President is worried about the flow of oil -- because the global community and the Americans are worried about it -- and also the security of Israel?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What was the last one?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Security of Israel.\xc2\xa0 If Iran doesn\xe2\x80\x99t -- Middle East doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become another Iran for the Middle East -- for Israel.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, our commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is unshakeable, as you know.\xc2\xa0 And that is always a concern for us.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of oil, obviously, we are monitoring oil prices very carefully, but I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t speculate about where those prices may go in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And second, as far as India, when President was in India in November and he announced by addressing the U.S.-India Business Council in Mumbai that thousands of jobs will be created here in the U.S. and India-U.S. relations, and Secretary of Commerce was recently in India.\xc2\xa0 So what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now as far as India-U.S. relations are concerned?\xc2\xa0 Especially, trade, commerce, and creating good jobs, and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously very committed to the commitments that were made and to the importance of job creation here that is helped by increased trade with India.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specifically on that for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, let me follow up on oil prices if I can.\xc2\xa0 Since your briefing began, West Texas crude topped $100 a barrel.\xc2\xa0 Is this just a matter of watching, or is there anything the U.S. government can do to ensure continued oil flow from -- well, from Africa\xe2\x80\x99s biggest oil supplier -- North\xe2\x80\x99s Africa\xe2\x80\x99s biggest oil supplier?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, whenever there\xe2\x80\x99s unrest in this part of the world, there are going to be reactions in the markets.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, the situation is fluid, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate about where prices will go or any other potential things in the future.\xc2\xa0 But we are obviously monitoring this carefully and we\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about it.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re just monitoring it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got questions for you on the DOMA decision.\xc2\xa0 What kind of reaction are you expecting from Congress as a result of this decision?\xc2\xa0 And what is the administration doing to prepare for that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tell me again?\xc2\xa0 Sorry, what kind of reaction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you expecting from Congress as a result of this decision?\xc2\xa0 Any sort of backlash from Congress, and were you prepared for that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t want to speculate about how members of Congress might react.\xc2\xa0 We have, I believe -- and if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen these, you should -- the Attorney General has put out a statement and there\xe2\x80\x99s a notification or a letter to Congress that explains the course of action that\'s being taken.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that, I don\'t -- I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speculate.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I got a statement from Speaker Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s office on this issue.\xc2\xa0 This is from their press office:\xc2\xa0 While Americans want Washington to focus on creating jobs and cutting spending, the President will have to explain why he thinks now is the appropriate time to stir up a controversial issue that sharply divides the nation.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your response to that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say simply, as I said in the beginning, that the administration had no choice.\xc2\xa0 It was under a court-imposed deadline to make this decision.\xc2\xa0 This case in the Second Circuit was unique in that it lacked the precedent upon which to defend the Defense of Marriage Act in the way that this administration had defended it in previous cases.\xc2\xa0 It, therefore, required this decision on its constitutionality, and we had to act because of the deadline.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We are also absolutely focused and committed on these key issues of economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 And we are now anticipating that this will move to the courts, and the courts will decide.\xc2\xa0 And meanwhile, we will continue to focus on job creation and economic growth and winning the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to be clear, just to be clear, will this decision -- does it just apply to the four pending lawsuits on DOMA?\xc2\xa0 Or does it apply to any -- another lawsuit for DOMA in the future?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer -- but I would refer you to the Justice Department.\xc2\xa0 My understanding is that because of the decision about the constitutionality of DOMA and the position that the administration is taking, that we will no longer defend DOMA going forward.\xc2\xa0 We will, however, continue to enforce it.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to be participants in the cases to allow those cases to continue and be resolved, and also so that Congress or members of Congress can pursue the defense if they so desire.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just have one last question, one last question.\xc2\xa0 Is there any outcome at the district or appellate level that would persuade the Obama administration to volunteer discontinuing enforcement of DOMA throughout the nation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\'re asking me to speculate.\xc2\xa0 I would also note that the President is obligated to enforce the law.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Peter.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, so imposing a no-fly zone in Libya, that\'s under active consideration right now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into specifics, but I will say that we are reviewing a variety of options with our international partners to compel or to persuade the government of Libya to cease this terrible violence.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And could you also maybe give us any insight into why that might be the right course of action at this point, or whether it is --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going -- you mean a specific course of action?\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.\xc2\xa0 What we are looking for are courses of action that have produced the desired results, which is an end to the bloodshed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, when you look at state capitals in Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with a governor trying to address basically state entitlements, something the President says the federal government has to do as well?\xc2\xa0 And are the Democratic members of those legislatures correct to simply leave the state and not deal with the legislation on the floor?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will -- on the specific actions that members of different legislatures have taken, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to judge that, but I will -- from here.\xc2\xa0 But I will say that there is nothing wrong with -- as the President made clear in his interview with a Wisconsin television station, he firmly believes that state legislatures and governors need to address their fiscal issues, just as he is working with Congress to address fiscal problems at the federal level.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 His view is that it is important that everyone work together towards that goal; that public sector employees obviously have to tighten their belts, others have to tighten their belts, but that this should not be an effort that goes after some of the fundamental rights of collective bargaining in the name of reducing the deficit.\xc2\xa0 Because that -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that the best outcomes will be when everyone sits at the table -- executive branch, legislatures, union members -- and deals with these issues in a productive way so that they can be resolved, precisely so that these states can get control of their budgets, as we are very aggressively trying to get control of ours.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Since it is happening in a number of states, does he see this debate now becoming more national?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on his behalf or mine about where this debate is going.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me pick on some folks that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Following up on Wendell\xe2\x80\x99s question earlier about the Libyan opposition, does the administration have a dialogue, either through a back channel or more public, with any of the international opposition or expatriate groups who have been speaking out against Colonel Qaddafi for years?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually will direct you to the State Department on that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything about our engagement at that level, but perhaps the State Department does.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A follow-up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on a second.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Pakistan, how concerned -- if you can give us some idea separate of State Department output -- how concerned is the President with this diplomatic situation?\xc2\xa0 And has the presidential visit to Pakistan -- is it now in jeopardy?\xc2\xa0 Was it ever placed in question by the whole situation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will simply say that our position is the same as it was, which we believe that the principle that every country in the world that participates in the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations has a responsibility to honor the provisions of that treaty.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s our starting point in dealing with this issue.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to be focused on a resolution that results in Pakistan honoring the diplomatic immunity status of the individual and his return home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Savannah.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two things.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. believe it has any leverage over Qaddafi?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The United States believes that, as I think I said the other day, that the most effective action here is -- will be taken in a united way by our -- the United States with its international partners; that that will have hopefully the most significant impact on the behavior of the Libyan government. And we are working very closely with our allies and our partners in the international community and examining multilateral actions as well as bilateral actions that will bring about the kind of result that we think is absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And why has the President not spoken out on Libya until now\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Savannah, I would just direct you to what I said before, which is the President has issued a statement in his words.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You consider a paper statement equal in force, magnitude, impact to an on-camera statement?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will say that the President is going to speak directly about this either later today or tomorrow.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the nature of the Qaddafi regime and the unpredictability of his behavior limit what the United States could do to stop this bloodshed, barring except articulating U.S. principles?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, to us it\xe2\x80\x99s not about individual leaders, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the principles that guide our positions.\xc2\xa0 And we insist that the bloodshed end -- together with many other countries.\xc2\xa0 We insist that the universal rights of the Libyan people be recognized and respected.\xc2\xa0 And we believe that for Libya, as well as other countries, that reforms need to be taken to respond to the aspirations that have been voiced so profoundly by Libyans and other peoples in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the people of these individual countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned the safety of U.S. citizens as a factor. Are oil prices a factor as well in formulating U.S. position?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say simply that our position has to do with the absolute necessity to end the bloodshed, with the need to recognize the universal rights of the citizens of Libya and the need to protect American citizens.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m going to go all the way back, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\'ve hit that road.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that President Obama is going to meet President Calder\xcf\x8cn next week here at the White House.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what is the reason of the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the full question.\xc2\xa0 Say that again?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We understand that next week President Obama will receive here at the White House the President of Mexico, Felipe Calder\xcf\x8cn.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us what is the reason of the meeting?\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President is deeply committed to the strong partnership the United States has with Mexico.\xc2\xa0 I think that is the reason for the meeting.\xc2\xa0 We admire the commitment and sacrifices of the Mexican people as they confront the criminal organizations that have brought so much violence to Mexico, specifically on those issues which I know have been in the news. But this is a vital and important relationship with an important ally.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When is going to take place the meeting?\xc2\xa0 The third?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m sorry?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When?\xc2\xa0 The day of the meeting?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that for you.\xc2\xa0 But maybe I can get a specific for you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t done anybody standing.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you very much, Jay.\xc2\xa0 When you say reviewing options with international partners, are we talking about NATO as an entity and NATO members in particular?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I was -- I think I was referring to the United Nations Security Council, but we\xe2\x80\x99re consulting with our international partners about different things we can do to effect the change that we think is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When we discuss, for instance, no-fly zone, would NATO as an organization, which has been used in the past, could be --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on you -- on specific optionss.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somali pirates?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.\xc2\xa0 Andre -- yes, right up front.\xc2\xa0 Yes, sir.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How would the White House read the performance of the Gulf Coast Claims Facility and Ken Feinberg in handling oil spill claims?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, in the wake of the unprecedented oil spill, the President worked to secure a $20 billion fund that would be used to pay claims and would be administered by a third party.\xc2\xa0 Ken Feinberg, whom you mentioned, was appointed by BP to manage that process.\xc2\xa0 This administration, through the Department of Justice, has made clear -- has clearly communicated its concerns -- some of the concerns that we have had and has publicly urged the Gulf Coast Claims Facility to take a number of steps to improve the process.\xc2\xa0 I would point you to -- for more on that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a filing that the Justice Department made I think in the last day or two.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that filing, though, they said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States is not in a position to comment on any specific claims or their treatment by the GCCF.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Why won\xe2\x80\x99t the Justice Department or the Obama administration say if Feinberg is doing a good job, a bad job, somewhere in the middle?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, I would point you to the Department of Justice, which is administering that -- or at least overseeing that -- and to the document that they file.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somali pirates?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two questions?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, thank you very much.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 Margaret.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I know you said that it\xe2\x80\x99s not about the person when we were talking about Libya, but does the President believe, given what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the last few days, that Qaddafi can continue to lead Libya?\xc2\xa0 And what message do you believe it would send to other countries where there is now civil unrest but nobody has been toppled yet if he were able to remain in power?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Margaret, again, I would point you to the fact that this is not about individual leaders, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about personalities.\xc2\xa0 And our position has never been -- with regards to Libya or any of the other countries that have been affected by unrest and by demonstrations, peaceful demonstrations by the peoples of those countries -- that we should be selecting the leaders or deciding who can or cannot lead a country.\xc2\xa0 The process is what\xe2\x80\x99s important:\xc2\xa0 the respect for universal rights, the ability of the people in these countries to participate in the political process in a democratic way and to have their voices heard and, through that process, to enhance the possibilities for prosperity and economic growth in their country.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about individual leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If your position shifts at some point, do you believe that would be in a unified sense with other countries?\xc2\xa0 Should we not expect the United States to take a different position unless other people --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to speculate, but our position on this has been very uniform and clear with regards to all these countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me -- sir, yes, next to Sam, on the right of Sam.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name, sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jared.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, Jared, okay, nice to see you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, does the President -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve outlined kind of the principles and what the President expects moving forward when it comes to the North African and Middle East unrest.\xc2\xa0 Does the President see this as kind of an arc, due to any overarching factors like decreased power of OPEC or dispersion of al Qaeda -- is there any -- are there any starting factors that the President sees crediting for this unrest?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jared, I would -- a starting point would be the speech in Cairo, which clearly recognized the need and called on the countries in the region to respond to, with reforms, the democratic aspirations of the people in the region.\xc2\xa0 On al Qaeda I would note that the change that has come about in this region has in many ways been a direct repudiation of the kind of change that violent terrorists want to bring about and the means by which they believe change should come about, which is death and destruction.\xc2\xa0 This has been peaceful change.\xc2\xa0 It has been pluralistic.\xc2\xa0 It has been -- really has unfolded in stark contrast to the methods of terrorist organizations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one more, Jay.\xc2\xa0 The President is going to the United Kingdom May 24 to 26.\xc2\xa0 Will he be in Chicago on the 16th? Any plans to be there?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that a trick question?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President planning to be in Chicago for Mayor --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on his schedule.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he call Rahm?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He did call and congratulate Rahm.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he say?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He congratulated him on his victory.\xc2\xa0 And I believe we put out a statement -- the President put out a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long was the conversation?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he phone him?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Somali pirates?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Hold on one second.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One second?\xc2\xa0 All right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hey, Jay, can you clarify something you said to Jared?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said -- he asked for a starting point of all the unrest and you said -- I just want to give you the chance to clarify this.\xc2\xa0 You said the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech in Cairo was the starting point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, no, no.\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Sam, for offering me the opportunity to clarify that.\xc2\xa0 I was simply saying as a starting point to understand our perspective and policy towards the region and the unrest that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in these last several weeks.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then, just to -- quickly on Wisconsin and Indiana. How closely is the President following the situations there?\xc2\xa0 And has he been in contact with national labor leaders since the episode began?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in contact with national labor leaders.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s aware of reports about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in these areas, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything more for you on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just two questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 One more all the way in the back.\xc2\xa0 My commitment to get to the back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the Small Business Forum that the President attended yesterday he expressed an interest in something called a tax credit for angel investors.\xc2\xa0 Those would be those with financial means to invest early on.\xc2\xa0 Is the President considering new initiatives in this area or part of a small business -- a broader small business package?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what the President was reflecting was this interest -- and Startup America is a good indication of his interest in just this, which is vehicles by which the government can assist the efforts by larger companies or investors to invest in smaller companies to speed up the process of growth and job creation and innovation.\xc2\xa0 So I think Startup America is a good indication of how important he views the role that small business and innovative businesses have in growing the economy and creating the industries that we need to compete in the 21st century.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he was very -- the forum yesterday was excellent in that regard because there were so many -- it was clear that the kind of small businesses that were represented there in Cleveland were exactly the kinds of businesses that will drive not just job creation -- because we all know that small businesses are the engine of economic growth -- but innovation, creativity, which is exactly what we need in this coming century.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you all very much.\xc2\xa0 Appreciate it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND</p>\n<p>\n\t1:36 P.M.
