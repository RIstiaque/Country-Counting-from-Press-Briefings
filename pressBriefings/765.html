EST</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no announcements to make, so I\'ll take your questions. \xc2\xa0Jim.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay. \xc2\xa0On the economy, the Commerce Department reported a contraction in GDP in the last quarter; we\'ve had declining consumer confidence for two months. \xc2\xa0A big factor in the shrinkage has been reductions in spending in defense it seems. \xc2\xa0The sequester is coming up. \xc2\xa0We hear talk on the Hill of just letting that kick in. \xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s the administration doing on that front? \xc2\xa0Are you willing to let the sequester kick in, as a lot of people on the Hill are saying? \xc2\xa0Or are you coming up with alternative cuts that would ease that pain?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in your question, so let me go first to the broader fact, which is that we have seen consistent job growth over almost three years. \xc2\xa0Home prices are starting to climb back. \xc2\xa0Consumer confidence overall has been rising and consumer spending has been rising. \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s more work to do and our economy is facing a major headwind, which goes to your point, and that\'s Republicans in Congress.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tTalk about letting the sequester kick in as though that were an acceptable thing belies where Republicans were on this issue not that long ago, and it makes clear again that this is sort of political brinksmanship of the kind that results in one primary victim, and that\'s American taxpayers, the American middle class.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYou\'re correct that the GDP number we saw today was driven in part by -- in large part by a sharp decrease in defense spending, the sharpest drop since I think 1972. \xc2\xa0And at least some of that has to do with the uncertainty created by the prospect of sequester. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tTo the end of your question, I would say that the President has had and continues to have very detailed proposals, including spending cuts, that would completely do away with the sequester if enacted, that approaches deficit reduction -- not just the $1.2 trillion called for by the sequester, but even beyond that \xc2\xa0-- in a balanced way. \xc2\xa0And the President looks forward to moving forward and making continuing progress with Congress to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut we\'ve been having a similar debate now for a long time and that is do we make progress in a balanced way on our deficits, or do we inflict harm on our economy here in Washington at a time when our economy is actually showing very positive signs, and where independent economic forecasters predict that, as long as Washington doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get in the way and do something foolish to our economy, that we should have continued economic growth and job creation this year at a steady pace.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo it can\'t be we\'ll let sequester kick in because we insist that tax loopholes remain where they are for corporate jet owners, or subsidies provided to the oil and gas companies that have done so exceedingly well in recent years have to remain in place. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just -- that\xe2\x80\x99s not I think a position that will earn a lot of support with the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But, as you know, tax reform can\'t be done in short order. \xc2\xa0Tax reform with revenues is even more difficult. \xc2\xa0Is there something that the President has in mind to deal with this quickly? \xc2\xa0Harry Reid has suggested doing this in increments. \xc2\xa0Would that be something that the President would be willing to consider?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, the President has been and continues to be interested in doing the biggest deal possible. \xc2\xa0Now, that was true when he worked towards a grand bargain with the Speaker of the House in the summer of 2011; it was true late last year when he worked on a big deal that, unfortunately, the Speaker walked away from at the end of last year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat seems to be true now is that we\'re doing this, as the President has said, in increments. \xc2\xa0We\'ve achieved $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0We need to do more in order to reach that level of $4 trillion over 10 years that would put us on a sustainable fiscal path for a decade. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe mechanisms of getting there are something that we\'ll evaluate as proposals are put forward. \xc2\xa0But the President\'s position on how we can achieve this is detailed and clear. \xc2\xa0The offer he made to Speaker Boehner, which I think was broadly recognized as coming at least halfway to the Republican position as a good-faith offer that would have achieved, if enacted, broad deficit reduction, remains on the table if Republicans are interested in engaging on that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo what we can\'t do is -- I mean, it\'s disheartening, although we have moved, at least temporarily, beyond the flirtation with default, to see Republican leaders say, I\'ve got sequester in my back pocket. \xc2\xa0It\'s not a game. \xc2\xa0It\'s the American economy. \xc2\xa0Or, we should let the government shut down because it would be good for "member management" -- that\xe2\x80\x99s another House Republican leader on the record. \xc2\xa0I think the American people, those who pay attention to this issue in detail, are rightly appalled by those kind of tactics that do harm to their lives, do harm to the economy, in the name of achieving some political objectives here in Washington. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Quick question on the Mideast. \xc2\xa0Israel conducted an airstrike in Syria, according to reports, near the border with Lebanon. \xc2\xa0I wondered if the President was aware of that. \xc2\xa0Does he endorse that military action?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment for you on those reports. \xc2\xa0I\'d refer you to the government of Israel for questions about deliberations or actions that they may or may not have taken. \xc2\xa0So I just don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On sequestration, Senator Reid mentioned yesterday taking a look at oil and gas tax breaks as one way to avert sequestration, and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what you just mentioned, too, when you talked about subsidies. \xc2\xa0I guess I\'m wondering how actively is the White House working on that as a tool for averting sequestration on that specific point. \xc2\xa0And how concerned is the White House that getting rid of these loopholes would affect what is one of the few bright spots in the economy, all the jobs and economic activity created by oil and gas?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0One of the few bright spots? \xc2\xa0I would contest that. \xc2\xa0I think there have been, as I just noted, month after month of positive job creation. \xc2\xa0And there was positive economic growth in 2012 and 2011, and we continue to believe, as outside forecasters believe, that unless actions by those in Washington take us in a different direction, we will see positive economic growth and job creation this year.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo the idea that you need to subsidize an industry that has enjoyed record profits -- that taxpayers have to subsidize it -- just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense in a time when we have to make choices about how best to use our resources. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSpeaker of the House Boehner put forward, in theory, at least, a proposal late last year that said he could find $800 billion in revenues through tax reform alone -- closing of loopholes and capping of deductions. \xc2\xa0So surely what was a good idea then can\xe2\x80\x99t suddenly be a bad idea now. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIt\xe2\x80\x99s achievable -- significant revenue is achievable through tax reform. \xc2\xa0And it has to be part of a balanced approach, an approach which has always in the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals seen more spending cuts than revenue, and that reflects the kind of balance that allows us to make sure that the burden of deficit reduction is not borne solely by senior citizens or the middle class but more broadly; that asks the wealthiest, including corporations, to pay their fair share; asks people to play by the same set of rules. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just an approach that is broadly supported by the American people. \xc2\xa0And it makes sense, as it did in getting us to the $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved so far, it makes sense in getting us further along the road.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s report seemed to point to the need for growth, obviously. \xc2\xa0I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, is the White House -- how actively the White House is looking for -- at shifting the balance from cuts, from deficit reduction, to growth measures.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m glad you asked that question because, as you know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, and others here know, every proposal the President has put forward in these series of negotiations and debates with Republicans about deficit reduction have -- every proposal has included significant investments in our economy -- in infrastructure, in education, in putting teachers and police officers back on the street.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, every one of those proposals has, by and large, been opposed by Republicans, but they represent the President\xe2\x80\x99s view that deficit reduction is not a goal unto itself; it should be in service of the broader goal, which is positive economic growth and job creation, and that we need to continue to invest wisely to ensure that our economy grows. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tInvesting in infrastructure, for example, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just create jobs in the near term; it helps build a foundation for sustained economic growth in the decades to come. \xc2\xa0Investing in clean energy technologies and industries serves a trifold purpose -- it helps create jobs now; it helps ensure that we will compete and, in some cases, dominate in the industries of the 21st century; and it ensures that those good-paying jobs in the future continue to find themselves here rather than abroad.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo that\xe2\x80\x99s always been the President\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s contained within the proposals that he made to Speaker Boehner at the end of the year, and he will always continue to insist that even as we reduce our deficit in a responsible and balanced way that we make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re taking the steps necessary to allow our economy to grow. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe sequester is a perfect case in point. \xc2\xa0Across-the-board cuts to education, to research and development would have damaging effects on our economy and our long-term economic prospects. \xc2\xa0They would also have damaging effects on border security. \xc2\xa0People tend to forget the sequester is divided in two: defense and nondefense. \xc2\xa0The nondefense portion includes funding for border security, an issue that is very topical these days. \xc2\xa0So we should do the responsible thing and make sure we move forward with balanced deficit reduction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go back and forth. \xc2\xa0Christi.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, a 15-year-old girl names Hadiya Pendleton was shot in Chicago yesterday. \xc2\xa0She was a bystander, it seems, in a shooting in a park not far from the President\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xc2\xa0A week ago, she was here to perform for the inaugural ceremonies. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if the President has heard about it and if you could share a reaction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible tragedy any time a young person is struck down with so much of their life ahead of them. \xc2\xa0And we see it far too often. \xc2\xa0The President and the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and prayers are with the family of Hadiya Pendleton. \xc2\xa0All of our thoughts and prayers are with her family. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd as the President has said, we will never be able to eradicate every act of evil in this country, but if we can save any one child\xe2\x80\x99s life, we have an obligation to try when it comes to the scourge of gun violence. \xc2\xa0The President has more than once, when he talks about gun violence in America, referred not just to the horror of Newtown or Aurora or Virginia Tech or Oak Creek, but to shootings on the corner in Chicago or other parts of the country. \xc2\xa0And this is just another example of the problem that we need to deal with.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, on that, there\xe2\x80\x99s a petition to urge the President to attend Hadiya Pendleton\xe2\x80\x99s funeral in Chicago. \xc2\xa0Is that something that he would consider doing?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have no scheduling announcements to make. \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m not even aware of the petition.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Has he reached out to the family? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any communications to read out.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And when you look at a tragedy like this, it comes at a time when Chicago has seen such a scourge of gun violence. \xc2\xa0This is a city that has some of the strongest gun control laws, strictest gun control laws in the country, and yet has seen this -- a real outbreak of gun violence. \xc2\xa0Does that give us any lessons for dealing with the issue?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think there are a lot of issues that are particular to a single city within a broader state and country having gun laws of one kind versus gun laws elsewhere. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s -- people address that issue when they talk about Washington, D.C. that\xe2\x80\x99s just across the river from Virginia.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut I think the broader point is that, as I just said, while we may not be able to prevent every act of gun violence -- surely we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to prevent every act of gun violence -- we need to take action to reduce gun violence. \xc2\xa0We need to take action on common-sense measures that do not infringe upon our Second Amendment rights, that do not take away a gun from any law-abiding American citizen, but that makes sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing everything we can in a responsible way to reduce this violence, to protect our children, including Hadiya Pendleton and others. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe fact that we can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem entirely doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to solve it in part.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And what do you say to somebody like Democrat Heidi Heitcamp, who -- a member of the President\xe2\x80\x99s party, come out skeptical of the idea that the gun control laws are the way to go about this? \xc2\xa0And she\xe2\x80\x99s not alone. \xc2\xa0Obviously other people -- Joe Manchin -- several Democrats in the Senate who think this is just not the right way to go. \xc2\xa0What is the President doing to convince members of his own party in the Senate that are against the measures?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, he has had conversations with various lawmakers on this issue, including those who have a strong record of support for Second Amendment rights, and I would note that the President has a strong record of support for Second Amendment rights. \xc2\xa0The point he\xe2\x80\x99s making, and I think the point that a lot of people have been making, including lawmakers have been making, in the wake of Newtown is that we can do common-sense things that still protect those Second Amendment rights and that address this problem and address it in a broader way than just through gun control legislation, although that\xe2\x80\x99s an important piece of it. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why you saw the President move quickly, with the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s assistance and leadership, to put forward that package of proposals, because we need to do something about this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Dr. Harper, Intermountain Christian News. \xc2\xa0Regarding religious liberty faith issues, a lot of Christian churches want to know about how this relates to the problems we\xe2\x80\x99re going through as a nation economically and otherwise, that would believe that our religious faith liberties -- faith and religious liberties and life come from Jesus, not man. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is -- I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the question.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll rephrase that. \xc2\xa0Basically, the Christian churches in our nation are concerned about the moral decline in our nation and how faith and religious liberty issues and life are crucial, from the Declaration of Independence, and how that they would believe that our rights come from Jesus, not men. \xc2\xa0How would the administration respond to that?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I have an administration response. \xc2\xa0I would tell you that the President, as a man of faith, believes very deeply in the importance that it plays in his life and understands clearly the importance it plays in the lives of so many millions of Americans.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, Major.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Is the GDP report good news or bad news?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any time you see a reduction in economic growth, that it\xe2\x80\x99s good news, but I think we need to understand what lies underneath it. \xc2\xa0The sharp drop in particular in defense spending, which is consistent with what we know has been going on in preparation for the possibility of sequester -- that was the case towards the end of the year when sequester was supposed to kick in on January 1st, and now of course we have a new deadline for that.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe broader point, I think, is that -- and I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some reporting to reflect this -- that there remain even within this report indications, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s housing or consumer spending or business investment, that we continue to be poised for positive economic growth and job creation. \xc2\xa0And we need to make sure that in Washington, we are not taking actions that undercut that progress that we have been making and can continue to make and will continue to make. \xc2\xa0We need to take steps that encourage it and foster it and help it along. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believes we have to be balanced and that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t flirt with things like default or shutdown or sequester. \xc2\xa0We should get about the business of reaching compromise in a way that reflects broad public sentiment about how we should do it, and make sure that -- to a point earlier, that we\xe2\x80\x99re, even as we reduce our deficit, we\xe2\x80\x99re making the necessary investments to allow our economy to continue to grow.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And to the point you made about consumer spending and housing growth, you remember because you were, I remember because I was there, when he was a candidate for the presidency, Senator Obama often said that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a recipe for a healthy U.S. economy -- consumer-driven or -- which sometimes incurs debt, and a real estate bubble. \xc2\xa0We need a broader, more fundamental sense of economic growth and economic stability. Is there anything in this most recent GDP report that indicates that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anyone suggest that the fact that the housing market has been rebounding from the burst of the housing bubble, that that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of -- that that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad economic sign. \xc2\xa0I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive economic sign. \xc2\xa0I think business investment increasing is a positive economic sign. \xc2\xa0And I think that when we talk about broader economic growth, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturing or other areas of the economy, the breadth is what matters here. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tAnd we have seen over the course of many quarters now broad economic growth. \xc2\xa0Not enough. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President insists we continue to take action. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why it remains his number-one priority that we take measures that help the economy grow and create jobs, and that we do it in a way that protects and expands the middle class.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I gather this is what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say about sequestration -- would be something akin to mindless austerity right now? \xc2\xa0Is that something that you would agree with?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think the point of sequester, sequestration \xc2\xa0-- and I imagine the people in their homes shudder every time they hear us use those words because they sound like Washington-speak -- but the point of the trigger that created these across-the-board cuts evenly divided between defense and nondefense was to make them so onerous that that fact would compel Congress to come up with specific, sensible deficit reduction. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President put forward a proposal to the super committee that reflected the balance that was inherent in every serious bipartisan proposal, including the Simpson-Bowles proposal. \xc2\xa0A refusal at the time to allow revenue to be a part of that meant that the super committee did not produce. \xc2\xa0And the President has continued to push this principle forward. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s the principle that is broadly supported by the American people and it\xe2\x80\x99s the one that makes the most sense for economic growth.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is it imperative to avoid it at this stage? \xc2\xa0March 1st is a looming deadline. \xc2\xa0It is not imaginary. \xc2\xa0It\xe2\x80\x99s not theoretical. \xc2\xa0Is it imperative --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think I made clear at the very top here that we disagree with those in Congress who increasingly seem to suggest that it would be a good thing or a welcome thing to have in your \xe2\x80\x9cback pocket\xe2\x80\x9d to make happen, or to use as a means of \xe2\x80\x9cmember management.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Inflicting damage on the economy as -- to achieve some political goals here in Washington seems like a very bad idea. \xc2\xa0We do not support it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you send legislation to avoid it?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We have legislation to avoid it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0That is along the lines of dealing with oil and gas tax subsidies or something else incrementally to push it out just a couple, three months?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t -- the President believes that we should be able to deal with this in the remaining portion of the goal of $4 trillion of deficit reduction as a whole, and that proposal that remains on the table is available to Republicans if they choose to take it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe are interested in avoiding sequester. \xc2\xa0And I don\'t want to prejudge how negotiations or conversations or proposals to do that might come forward. \xc2\xa0But we do not agree with the principle that seems to be increasingly voiced by some Republicans on Capitol Hill that somehow sequester is a good thing.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up on that? \xc2\xa0Unlike a government shutdown or a default, the sequester is an example of something that happens if Congress doesn\'t do its job. \xc2\xa0Congress did its job and created the sequester and you helped design it. \xc2\xa0And you said the point of it was to be so onerous that no one would want it to happen. \xc2\xa0Well, it sounds like people are rethinking that and are willing to have it happen. \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering did you miscalculate when you designed this thing that was supposed to be so horrendous that people would be forced to their senses as an alternative?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I could read you quote after quote after quote from Republicans saying how desperately important it is to avoid sequester because of the impact -- the negative impact it would have. \xc2\xa0And if they\'ve changed their minds, they\'ve changed their minds for apparently nakedly political reasons. \xc2\xa0Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0What would those be? \xc2\xa0The naked political reasons?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, it says here in the Wall Street Journal, Speaker Boehner suggests that having sequester in his back pocket is a good thing, in terms of negotiations. \xc2\xa0Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a positive way to approach an issue that does harm to our economy, and even the uncertainty the possibility creates has contributed to the GDP number we\'ve seen today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo our point is there are responsible ways to deal with this. \xc2\xa0The American public believes that we ought to be responsible in the way that we deal -- the ways that we deal with it. \xc2\xa0And the President has put forward a good-faith proposal that met Republicans more than halfway in the effort to achieve significant deficit reduction in a responsible, balanced way that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for the across-the-board cuts in defense or nondefense spending that everybody understands to be a bad thing. And we look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats to enact that approach, because it\'s the right thing to do.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can you just review -- are you talking about chain CPI? What exactly are you talking about? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0The widely reported proposal the President put on the table with the Speaker of the House remains on the table. And that includes the spending cuts, the health care entitlement reforms, and the revenue. \xc2\xa0So the portion of that proposal that was enacted when we dealt with the so-called fiscal cliff obviously you take out, but there remains -- everything else there remains the President\'s position. \xc2\xa0And it demonstrates that he is willing to make tough choices. \xc2\xa0He is willing to enact spending cuts, as long as we address deficit reduction in a balanced way. \xc2\xa0And we need and expect a similar-minded approach to this problem from Republicans, one that serves the American people and the American economy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Speaker Boehner also reportedly says the President told him personally this country does not have a spending problem. \xc2\xa0Did that happen?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, you know, there is a lot of reports about conversation internally. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a readout of any of the President\'s personal conversations with the Speaker or anyone else to provide to you. \xc2\xa0I think anyone who looks at this issue, including the leading deficit hawks in Washington, will tell you that health care spending is the major driver of our deficits in the future. \xc2\xa0So that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President believed that we needed to address health care spending through the Affordable Care Act. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has put forward significant entitlement reforms that help address the issue of health care spending going forward. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything inconsistent -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not confirming a conversation; I\xe2\x80\x99m simply saying that it, of course, is a fact that our health care entitlement spending is something that we need to address and the President has actively and substantially addressed it, and continues to address it in the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat is also true is our nondefense discretionary spending \xc2\xa0-- putting aside entitlements, putting aside defense -- is at its lowest level since Dwight Eisenhower. \xc2\xa0So the President has been very serious about spending cuts. \xc2\xa0Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, he signed into law $2.5 trillion in spending cuts, and wants to do more as long as we do it in a balanced way. \xc2\xa0Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to say that oil and gas companies or corporate jet owners or others who enjoy benefits -- hedge fund managers -- through the loopholes in our tax code should be held harmless while we ask senior citizens to pay more. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s just -- he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that reflects the balanced approach we need to take.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So given the level of nondefense discretionary spending, does the President believe we do not have a spending problem?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Wendell, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what rhetorical game you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to engage in. \xc2\xa0What he said -- I mean, what is true is that we have a health care spending problem. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why the President addressed it in the Affordable Care Act. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s addressed it in the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward, and he has addressed it in discretionary spending cuts and he has put forward more spending cuts. \xc2\xa0There are spending cuts in his proposal before the Speaker of the House.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, you can take that and make it mean something else but that would not be honest.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On another matter, Jay?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Marsha Blackburn has challenged the President\xe2\x80\x99s comments about skeet shooting at Camp David. \xc2\xa0She\xe2\x80\x99s skeptical of them and she says she\xe2\x80\x99s a better skeet shooter than he is and wants to be invited to Camp David for a contest. \xc2\xa0Your reaction?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I have none. \xc2\xa0(Laughter.)</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tJessica.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0The NRA\xe2\x80\x99s Wayne LaPierre today testified on the Hill and he in part refuted the idea that universal background checks would make a difference, in part pointing to the administration\xe2\x80\x99s record not prosecuting those who have been found to have illegally purchased guns. \xc2\xa0Can the -- what\xe2\x80\x99s the administration\xe2\x80\x99s response?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a logical fallacy to suggest that universal background checks won\xe2\x80\x99t make a different. \xc2\xa0We do absolutely have to enforce the law and we also need to improve our background checks system. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something that -- an issue on which the NRA and Wayne LaPierre is in a very distinct minority, if that\xe2\x80\x99s their position. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo I also can tell you that everyone here was heartened to see Gabrielle Giffords testify today. \xc2\xa0She and her husband are going to be the White House later today for a meeting with the President, which the President is very much looking forward to.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And when is the President next going to be speaking out on guns?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, he will continue to make this issue a priority, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you will hear from him on this issue in the future, but I have no scheduling announcements to make.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he appear publicly with Gabrielle Giffords this afternoon?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that expectation. \xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s just looking forward to seeing her.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tYes, Mark.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, if I could move to immigration for a moment. \xc2\xa0Senator Marco Rubio said after the President\xe2\x80\x99s remarks yesterday that he was concerned that the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have enforcement trigger that would have to be in place before he\xe2\x80\x99d grant the path to citizenship. \xc2\xa0And he said his reason for that was that if there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a trigger in place, we would as a country face the prospect of having another huge influx of illegal immigration, similar to what happened after the \xe2\x80\x9886 law. What scope for compromise do you see on this issue with Republicans like Mr. Rubio? \xc2\xa0And do you accept the contention that there is a risk of large numbers of illegal immigrants if that sort of a linkage isn\xe2\x80\x99t in place?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Let me say a couple of things. \xc2\xa0First of all, the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to and seriousness about enforcement of our borders and our laws against illegal immigration is demonstrated by the record. \xc2\xa0And that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact that was echoed in comments by Senator McCain. \xc2\xa0We have made significant progress in border enforcement, and this President is committed to it. \xc2\xa0You heard him talk yesterday that one of the four pillars of his comprehensive approach is to continue the progress we\xe2\x80\x99ve made in border enforcement. \xc2\xa0So I think that\xe2\x80\x99s an important point to note when we talk about this.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe President believes -- and he made this clear yesterday \xc2\xa0-- that we have to have as part of comprehensive immigration reform a clear path to citizenship, one that includes fines and fees; one that includes background checks, making sure that you meet all the criteria that are necessary, and then you get to go to the end of the line. \xc2\xa0But there has to be a clear path, a path that ends in citizenship.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tNow, in terms of those specific comments, we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a variety of things from those who are active on this issue in both parties in the Senate and there is not clarity at all, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it, in terms of what the view is on this issue or what would be included when legislation is produced. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to prejudge legislation that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been written yet. \xc2\xa0But the President believes we have to have a clear path. \xc2\xa0He also believes and is committed to border enforcement and border security.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Can I just follow up? \xc2\xa0Does the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ca clear path\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca clear path from the outset\xe2\x80\x9d rule out enforcement triggers?\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to prejudge --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Will he decide when it --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rule out or rule in something that --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0There\xe2\x80\x99s a debate --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0But there\xe2\x80\x99s not a debate based on anything that is specific.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a debate on what --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s been -- I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a variety of things from different members of that group about what that means. \xc2\xa0And we will wait to judge legislation when legislation is written.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWhat I think is clear, as Senator McCain said, is that this President, and working with Congress, has been committed to enhancing our border security and our enforcement. \xc2\xa0That is demonstrated by fact after fact, some of which I listed the other day. \xc2\xa0And this President is committed to continued progress in border enforcement. \xc2\xa0And that\'s an important component of comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0The President sees it as a both-and, that we have to do both in order to make this work.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But not a precondition?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me to make a judgment about something that is not -- does not exist in legislation. \xc2\xa0I want to wait -- we want to wait and see where legislation ends up on this issue. \xc2\xa0Our point is the record is clear about the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to border security and it is a fundamental principle in his proposals that we need to do more.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would he support a guest worker program for low-skilled workers?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We will look to the Senate to -- or the Congress to develop proposals on this issue if the Congress desires. \xc2\xa0And we would want to make sure that it protects workers, including immigrant workers and that it is actually based on data-driven workforce demands, rather than political whim. \xc2\xa0So we\xe2\x80\x99ll -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to prejudge something that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been written up in legislation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tFirst Peter, then Zach.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Continuing on the conversation of immigration -- as part of the principles that the White House put out yesterday on streamlining legal immigration, it noted that it also \xe2\x80\x9ctreats same-sex families as families by giving U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents the ability to seek a visa on the basis of a permanent relationship with the same-sex partner.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Is the President willing to give on that issue in an effort to get the legislation passed?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0That position is consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s views. \xc2\xa0It is consistent with legislation that has previously been introduced in Congress, and the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal tracks that previous legislative proposal. \xc2\xa0The President has long believed that Americans with same-sex partners from other countries should not be faced with the painful choice between staying with the person they love or staying in the country they love. \xc2\xa0So that\'s -- his position is entirely consistent with where he\xe2\x80\x99s been and where the legislation has been.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, on the issues of guns versus immigration -- on the issue of immigration he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI will work tirelessly to make reform a reality in the Senate.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0But he was far less sort of forward and optimistic in his comments when it came to the issue of guns, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Does the President concede that immigration is going to be a much easier course for him than guns right now in an effort going forward?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0You would never hear the President make judgments like that. \xc2\xa0He does not believe that any of this important work is easy, and if it were easy it would have been done already. \xc2\xa0So both issues are important. \xc2\xa0Both issues have the President\'s support, and he will continue to work with Congress to take action on both fronts.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So nothing to be read into that his first trip of his second term was on the issue of immigration as opposed to guns?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, but his first -- prior to that, the first big event, if you will, of his second term, was on the issue of gun violence. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo there is an effort always I think to get us to rank priorities. \xc2\xa0I think the President has a series of top priorities, none greater than continued economic growth and job creation, but also immigration reform, addressing gun violence, dealing with our energy policies. \xc2\xa0These are all important priorities. \xc2\xa0And the American people didn\xe2\x80\x99t send members of Congress or the President to Washington to work just on one issue.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tPeter, did you have --\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0I was just going to ask one more question on a different topic, though. \xc2\xa0In remarks yesterday, General John Allen said that a \xe2\x80\x9cknockout blow\xe2\x80\x9d needs to delivered to the Taliban and other criminal networks to ensure that gains made by American combat troops after they leave. \xc2\xa0Is the U.S. confident that the Afghans will be able to, in his words, "knock out" the malicious elements of the Taliban without the help of the United States?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, as you know, the United States continues to have significant troop presence in Afghanistan. \xc2\xa0We are winding down that presence, as the President has made clear is his policy. \xc2\xa0And as we have done that and as we continue to do that, we continue to assist Afghanistan in the building up of and training of the Afghan National Security forces.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThat\xe2\x80\x99s the right policy. \xc2\xa0In the end, there has to be both reconciliation in the long term in Afghanistan, but there have to be Afghan forces that are and can be responsible for their own security. \xc2\xa0That process of turning over security lead to Afghanistan security forces is already underway, and will continue as American forces draw down.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSorry, Zach. \xc2\xa0Yes.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Two questions. \xc2\xa0First, on the sequester, does the President believe that going past the March 1 deadline would be a kind of mortal economic blow like the fiscal cliff and debt limit? \xc2\xa0Since the administration would have the power to sort of manage the sequester, does it have -- is there more room after the deadline to sort of come up with a -- we know you have a proposal for how do so, but is there room to manage, unlike with the fiscal cliff and the debt limit?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think all of us here today would hesitate to rank terrible things in order of their terribleness. So the fact is we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to that point. \xc2\xa0And we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and, fortunately, didn\xe2\x80\x99t yet get to the point where default was contemplated in any real way this time, because the last time it was merely contemplated it had severe negative effects on our economy.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe\'ve already seen data that reflects, in most economists estimates, the impact of uncertainty caused by the sequester. \xc2\xa0It\'s clearly a bad thing. \xc2\xa0We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that. \xc2\xa0We should instead address this issue in a responsible, sober way that ensures we move forward with deficit reduction; that we do it in a way that allows the economy to continue to grow; that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t involve political brinksmanship or trump cards or things out of your back pocket, or shutting down the government because it\'s useful politically. \xc2\xa0We should go about the business of helping the American economy, and through that, helping the American people.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Does the White House feel it has the capacity to manage the cuts so that there is more time to come to an agreement? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I think that, again, looking for exit ramps here for all of these problems is a diversion from the real issue, which is the need to address our fiscal challenges in a way that is balanced and responsible.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0On immigration quickly -- sorry. \xc2\xa0The President said yesterday he would drop a bill -- drop legislation you all had been working if Congress can\'t get its act together in the coming weeks. \xc2\xa0Can you give a little bit more specificity about what it means, what you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to see before the President decides whether to do that or not?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I thought you were going to say, can you give a date certain, and I was going to say I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to provide a timetable. \xc2\xa0The President is encouraged by the progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Congress. \xc2\xa0You heard him make that point yesterday. It reflects the fact that we have a growing consensus in this country behind support for comprehensive immigration reform. \xc2\xa0And he will -- we will monitor the progress in Congress. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIf their efforts to produce legislation bog down, we are prepared -- having done a lot of work on this issue -- to submit a bill on the President\xe2\x80\x99s behalf that would be the President\xe2\x80\x99s bill and we would ask the Senate to vote on it.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tWe hope that the positive steps we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen taken thus far, especially in the Senate, are just the beginning of a process that will end in legislation that has bipartisan support, that meets the tests and the principles that the President has put forward in his blueprints, that can then clear the Senate and the House and the President can sign. \xc2\xa0That would certainly be the best outcome in the President\xe2\x80\x99s view.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tApril.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, could you give us the tick-tock on how the President was informed about William \xe2\x80\x9cMo\xe2\x80\x9d Cowan, the person who\xe2\x80\x99s now appointed as a replacement for Senator Kerry?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any tick-tock on that. \xc2\xa0I mean, he may have found out the way the rest of us did when we saw it announced, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the Governor of Massachusett\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative based on Massachusett\xe2\x80\x99s law to appoint an interim senator, as I understand it. \xc2\xa0So, as you know, Senator Kerry yesterday notified the Vice President, Governor, and Senate leadership of his resignation, which becomes effective Friday at 4 p.m. \xc2\xa0And Governor Patrick has appointed a successor -- a temporary successor until there\xe2\x80\x99s an election. \xc2\xa0But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a tick-tock beyond the fact that it was announced today.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0He made it clear that it was really more so a diversity pick, picking an African American to fill this post. \xc2\xa0Any thoughts about that? \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think the President is encouraged that we have a record number of women and now African Americans serving in the U.S. Senate, and hopes there will be more diversity to come, because he believes that diversity adds to the quality of debate and reflects the richness of this nation. \xc2\xa0But that would be just a broad reaction.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0And another question on another subject, back on guns. Former Baltimore City mayor, Kurt Schmoke, is questioning the viability of the ATF when it relates to issues of stemming the flow of illegal guns and controlling guns. \xc2\xa0What say you with the ATF as it\xe2\x80\x99s been in existence for 75 years, billion-dollar budget, 5,000 employees -- does it need to be revamped? \xc2\xa0Does it need to be abolished? \xc2\xa0What?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, one thing it needs is a confirmed director, which it has lacked in the six years since that position was made a confirmable post. \xc2\xa0So the Congress has -- I mean, the President has called on Congress to act swiftly on his nominee. \xc2\xa0That would certainly be an important step towards ensuring that the ATF does the work that it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to do and does it well.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this goes beyond that six years?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0I don\'t have an assessment to make of that. \xc2\xa0I would point you to relevant agencies, including the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0But one step that we need to take right away that seems fairly simple is for the Senate to confirm the head of the ATF. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tRoger.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks. \xc2\xa0Back to the GDP for a moment. \xc2\xa0The economy coming to a standstill in the fourth quarter, is the magnitude enough to cause the administration to lower its economic growth forecast going forward, or is it not enough?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I don\'t make those forecasts, and I would point you to forecasts of independent and outside economists about the potential, anyway, the expectation, anyway, that this year we\xe2\x80\x99ll see continued economic growth and job creation.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThe one caveat in our view is that we believe that will happen as long as Washington -- and in this case, Congress and in particular Republicans in Congress -- don\'t inflict wounds on the economy unnecessarily. \xc2\xa0Most, I think, Americans believe that at the very least, Washington when it comes to the economy should do no harm, but they actually expect more. \xc2\xa0They expect us to enact policies that are sensible, that help the economy grow, that reduce the deficit in a responsible and balanced way. \xc2\xa0And that\'s the approach the President has always taken.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tIn terms of forecasts, I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it to the professionals.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Obviously, a lot of heightened concern in Israel about chemical weapons and the status of chem-bio weapons in Syria. \xc2\xa0One defense official -- you may not have seen this -- said government-controlled -- Syrian government-control of weapons and of poison gas could change at any time. \xc2\xa0Have we had a continuous confidence-building eyes on the status of --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0We are constantly monitoring Syria\xe2\x80\x99s proliferation-sensitive materials. \xc2\xa0That includes, obviously, chemical weapons and facilities. \xc2\xa0And we believe that Syria\xe2\x80\x99s chemical weapons stockpile remains under Syrian government control. \xc2\xa0This goes not to contemporary reports, but reports in the past. \xc2\xa0I can say that we have seen no information to confirm reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, but we are constantly monitoring that. \xc2\xa0The President has made clear what his red lines are with regards to the use of or proliferation of chemical weapons.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo, again, we monitor it regularly.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Just a quick follow on the gun -- there have been 72,000 cases where -- in 2010, just a single year -- 72,000 people were denied gun purchases based on background checks. \xc2\xa0So in other words, 72,000 people illegally tried to buy a gun in 2010, but only 62 of those cases were referred for prosecution. \xc2\xa0Why are so few of the current gun laws being prosecuted?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I think part of the overall approach here needs to be enforcement of the laws that we have, and that includes making a background check system that is not complete, that has enormous loopholes like the capacity for somebody not to submit to a background check if they go to a gun show or buy from a private seller. \xc2\xa0So identifying a problem does not refute that there are other problems.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But this is 72,000 people who tried to buy a gun illegally -- 72,000 -- and only 62 were prosecuted.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s part of an issue that needs to be addressed. \xc2\xa0But the citing of that statistic is designed to divert attention from another issue that is part of this, which is the need for broader and universal background checks, a position that --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But is that a problem?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Sure, we need to enforce the law. \xc2\xa0But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into discretion in enforcement. \xc2\xa0That\xe2\x80\x99s something I would direct to the Department of Justice. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tBut as we heard earlier, this is being pushed as a reason not to do something that the overwhelming majority of the American people support. \xc2\xa0And those kind of tactics I don\xe2\x80\x99t think are the right ones when the goal here should be working together to address the problem of gun violence.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Thanks, Jay.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Donovan, last one.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Jay, just to follow up on that -- actually, these statistics are being cited by Mayor Bloomberg in New York as part of the problem. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the point. \xc2\xa0The fact that there are other -- there are a variety of things we need to do doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do -- at least when it was first raised with me -- that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do background checks because there needs to be more prosecutions of those who violate background check laws. \xc2\xa0I don\xe2\x80\x99t think -- this is not an either/or in our view. \xc2\xa0We need to do a host of things that address this problem. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0So you\xe2\x80\x99re -- the administration is committed to increasing the number of --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Again, I would refer you to -- I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make declarations about law enforcement from here. \xc2\xa0I would refer you to the Justice Department. \xc2\xa0But the issue here is that we need to address all of these problems, and that includes through legislation that would universalize background checks, make the system -- rid it of the kinds of loopholes that allow people to\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t-- why somebody who is a gun shop owner who participates in the system and goes through it does that and then those who do it privately in their homes or at gun shows don\xe2\x80\x99t doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense and it definitely undermines the desired effect of the system. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tSo, again, we have -- the whole point of the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the broad approach to this was to acknowledge that there are a host of problems that we need to address and he\xe2\x80\x99s committed, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him say, to addressing it in a broad way.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks, guys.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Would you acknowledge people could be skeptical about a new law when the current ones aren\xe2\x80\x99t being enforced?</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Look, I think that making our background checks universal, making sure that everybody plays by the same rules is something that is broadly supported around the country. \xc2\xa0That fact does not mean that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do other things to address this problem. \xc2\xa0And I think that the skepticism you\xe2\x80\x99re hearing are from quarters who don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do anything on this issue, because this particular --</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0Not Mayor Bloomberg. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0Well, I agree, but this -- but I think Mayor Bloomberg would say that we need universal background checks. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tQ \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0But also enforce existing law.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tMR. CARNEY: \xc2\xa0And I\xe2\x80\x99m not arguing with that. \xc2\xa0I think the point is that we need to do a lot of things, and one thing we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do is say because we have other problems we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t address the universal background check system, which is a clear way to improve the system and which is broadly supported by the American people. \xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tThanks.</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\t\xc2\xa0</div>\n<div>\n\tEND</div>\n<div>\n\t1:44 P.M.
