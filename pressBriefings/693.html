EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good morning, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to New Jersey.\xc2\xa0 I think you have been provided information about today\xe2\x80\x99s visit to look at recovery efforts in the wake of Sandy, look at the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made restoring the Jersey Shore.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to the visit.\xc2\xa0 And with that, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on Syria, the U.N. has lifted the embargo on arming the rebels.\xc2\xa0 The Russians have announced a new sale of antiaircraft missiles to the Assad regime.\xc2\xa0 I wondered what the President\xe2\x80\x99s reaction is to both those developments.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we welcome the EU action.\xc2\xa0 As you know, support for the opposition is a track that we are pursuing even as we also work with the opposition in an effort to realize the Geneva Communique and bring about the political transition that is envisioned in it.\xc2\xa0 And Secretary Kerry has been working on that issue, as you know.</p>\n<p>On the matter of Russian arm sales, we\'ve made clear in the past and made clear again our firm belief that providing arms to the Assad regime does not bring us closer to the political transition that Syria deserves.\xc2\xa0 So our position on that has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you know that Senator McCain was going into Syria?\xc2\xa0 Did he carry a message from you there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We were aware, of course, that Senator McCain was going to make this trip.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the State Department for more about that in terms of the administration, and to Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s office in terms of the nature of the trip itself.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to speaking with Senator McCain upon his return to learn more about the trip.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So as far as you know, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t carry a message from the administration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I would just refer you to Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s office on that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator Reid is saying that there probably won\'t be votes on the President\xe2\x80\x99s remaining nominees until July.\xc2\xa0 What do you think is the effect of that delay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have been working closely with the Senate to have the President\xe2\x80\x99s nominees considered and confirmed, and we\'ve made some progress in regard to that and we continue to work with the Senate to make sure that more progress is made.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>On some of the nominees there have been obstacles thrown up by Republicans, as you know, which, unfortunately, is part of a practice of slowing down or trying to block highly qualified nominees from consideration by the Senate.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll continue to work with the Senate to bring about the confirmation that we need in order to effectively implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies and administer the government.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you end up having several nominees being considered in a compressed time period, does that -- is that a strategy you\'re hoping will help highlight --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can you be more specific -- which nominees are you asking about?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'m talking about the remaining Cabinet picks, for example -- do you think it help to have --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to Senator Reid for scheduling of votes in the Senate on nominations.\xc2\xa0 Our interest is in getting the President\xe2\x80\x99s qualified nominees confirmed as soon as possible after the appropriate consideration by the Senate.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, does the President have an opinion on the idea of further reform of the filibuster rules?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have expressed our concerns about the truly unfortunate delays in the confirmation process that Republicans have caused repeatedly.\xc2\xa0 The time lapse between consideration -- between committee hearings and consideration on the floor I believe is three to four times longer than under President Bush.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not an appropriate way to conduct the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional obligations when it comes to the confirmation process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we continue to urge Senate Republicans to act appropriately when it comes to the consideration of nominees.\xc2\xa0 They should be considered and then moved forward on.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen again and again where nominees have been held up, blocked, holds have been put on them for no justifiable reason, and then eventually when months and months and sometimes years later, the nomination is voted on, it\xe2\x80\x99s voted on unanimously in support, or with an overwhelming majority -- another indication that the delay in the process was simply about politics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, last year Governor Christie took the step of praising President Obama for his leadership in managing the recovery of Hurricane Sandy, and it was before the election and it came at some -- caused a political kerfuffle.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering now, several months out, what does President Obama think about Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s management of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 From what I know the President believes that Governor Christie has done an excellent job in the efforts he\xe2\x80\x99s undertaken, in coordination with and with the assistance of obviously federal resources, to recover from and rebuild from Sandy.\xc2\xa0 I think a storm like that and the terrible impacts it has had underscores the need for that cooperation between local, state and federal authorities.\xc2\xa0 And the best way for us to recover from storms that are as devastating as Sandy was is to have that cooperation be smooth and efficient.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve generally seen that.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly seen that, from our perspective, in terms of the FEMA response and the effort undertaken by Secretary Donovan -- led by Secretary Donovan in the Sandy rebuilding effort.\xc2\xa0 And I think that this visit today, as was the case when the President visited the Gulf Coast during the recovery period after the Deepwater Horizon spill demonstrates that we in the administration remain committed to recovery efforts long after the storm has passed and, generally speaking, after the media attention has subsided.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, what do you think is their personal relationship? Do you have any sense of Christie and Obama and what they think of each other personally?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\'t want to speak for Governor Christie. I know that the President has respect for Governor Christie and for his efforts on behalf of the citizens of New Jersey, and has found that focus to be key in creating the kind of coordination between federal, state and local entities that is so important when you have to recover from a storm like Sandy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Sandy and FEMA, there have been complaints that FEMA has been slow to draw up new flood maps that would help homeowners decide how to rebuild their homes, and that that\'s holding up some folks.\xc2\xa0 Is the President aware of the FEMA flood plain issue and what\xe2\x80\x99s being done about it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would refer you to FEMA for specifics, but generally speaking, I believe that the work of FEMA here in response to and as part of the recovery from Sandy has been viewed favorably because of the efficiency of it.\xc2\xa0 And the fact of the matter is, since Sandy made landfall in southern New Jersey, FEMA has obligated billions of dollars to support state and local rebuilding efforts and disbursed more than $1.8 billion directly to more than 180,000 individuals across the affected region, covering eligible repair costs and meeting temporary needs.</p>\n<p>And shortly after signing a $60 billion supplemental for Sandy aid, the administration worked expeditiously to get the first portion of that money out the door and, in February, provided an additional $5.4 billion to the affected states, with more money to support major rebuilding efforts on its way.</p>\n<p>Just last week, Secretary Ray LaHood announced an additional $3.7 billion in disaster relief funds to help the four major transit agencies in New York and New Jersey that sustained the greatest damage from Hurricane Sandy.\xc2\xa0 The Sandy Task Force, as I mentioned before, is led by HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, and it along with FEMA continue to work closely with our state and local partners as they make decisions about long-term rebuilding needs.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tI think as you will hear from the President today, what we know is that more work needs to be done -- one of the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re here is to make it clear that the recovery effort is not complete and that work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0 And when there are issues that arise that need attention, the President is committed to ensuring that his administration, whether its through the task force led by Secretary Donovan or through FEMA, will respond and continue the efforts that began immediately after landfall.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, was this visit at the President\xe2\x80\x99s request or Governor Christie\xe2\x80\x99s request?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the origin of the visit.\xc2\xa0 These kinds of visits are always done in coordination with the state as well as the administration.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the Post says there\xe2\x80\x99s a report that key U.S. weapons designs have been hacked supposedly by China.\xc2\xa0 Is this a fact, and is this going to be the lead item for discussion with the Chinese President?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the report.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Pentagon for specifics about the potential hacking of weapon systems.\xc2\xa0 But I would note, as you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the President, his National Security Advisor and others, as well as myself, cyber-security is a key priority of this administration.\xc2\xa0 It is a key concern that we have.\xc2\xa0 It is an issue that we raise at every level in our meetings with our Chinese counterparts and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure will be a topic of discussion when the President meets with President Xi in California in early June.\xc2\xa0 It was certainly a topic of conversation when National Security Advisor Donilon was having meetings in China, from which he is just returning now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just to clarify -- earlier on Syria, when it was asked, did the White House relay a message through Senator McCain, you said to ask John McCain?\xc2\xa0 Why would McCain answer that question?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d just refer you to Senator McCain for details on his visit.\xc2\xa0 I can simply say because I\'ve been asked, and others have, that the administration was, of course, aware that he was making the trip.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, we tend to refer members of Congress to comment on their congressional --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You don\'t want to comment on --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as a rule we refer to members of Congress to take questions about their visits abroad.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a quick question on Iraq?\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been a ton of violence in Iraq -- car bombs and as many as 350 deaths in the last couple of weeks.\xc2\xa0 Is this something that the U.S. is monitoring even though our war there is complete?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have an important and ongoing relationship with the government of Iraq and the Iraqi people.\xc2\xa0 We engage with the government on issues all the time.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we continue to monitor and continue to provide advice on both with Iraq and with countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 This is a matter that I know, from having worked with him on it, the Vice President remains concerned about and focused on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Thanks.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t11:12 A.M. EDT</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
