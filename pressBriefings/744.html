Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:20 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thank you for being here.\xc2\xa0 I just want to note the President has a Cabinet meeting at 1:00 p.m., so we\'re going to need to move through this quickly.\xc2\xa0 I will try to be precise and concise in my answers and move around as quickly as I can.\xc2\xa0 And for that reason, I have no topper.</p>\n<p>Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Now that the sequester cuts have begun to take effect I\'m wondering what we should be expecting from the White House.\xc2\xa0 Are officials going to be trying to point out negative impacts of the sequester?\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort that\'s going to be underway to try to build some type of public reaction to pressure Washington to avert these cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We made clear that the imposition of the sequester will have serious consequences for middle-class Americans across the country.\xc2\xa0 The sequester will have serious consequences for Defense Department contractors, civilian workers, and for our defense readiness.\xc2\xa0 It will have serious consequences for families whose child will lose a Head Start slot, for workers on the border -- border security agents, for air traffic controllers who will have their hours cut.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I\'m sure you will be hearing about these impacts from Americans themselves who will wonder why Republicans made this choice, why they wouldn\'t go along with what they did two months ago, why they wouldn\'t go along with balanced deficit reduction, why they chose protecting tax loopholes for the few rather than protecting the jobs of the many or protecting our economy.</p>\n<p>There have been and there will be specific effects that we\'ll see, and there will be the overall effect, which I don\'t think anybody argues with -- CBO, Macroeconomics Advisers, Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, others have estimated that we will lose up to three-quarters of a million jobs because of sequester, if it stays in place, and our economy will grow by a full half a percentage point more slowly than it would have otherwise -- or more.</p>\n<p>We\'ll continue to talk about this because it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the country.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s unnecessary.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a self-inflicted wound on the economy.\xc2\xa0 But we\'ll also continue to work on those things that the American people expect us to work on -- on creating jobs, growing the economy, making sure that we get comprehensive immigration reform, making sure that we move forward towards getting a comprehensive set of initiatives in place to reduce gun violence, and other things.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What was the President asking from lawmakers he talked to on Saturday?\xc2\xa0 And can we also get a list of the lawmakers that he called?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President had conversations with Republicans and Democrats over the weekend about the sequester specifically, and the broader issue of balanced deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke here the other day about believing that there is a caucus of common sense out there, lawmakers in both parties who understand that we need to do tough things to achieve entitlement reforms because that\'s the right thing for our economy, and we need to do tough things on tax reform -- tough things for Republicans -- go along with tax reform in a way that generate revenues to pay down our deficit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\'s the kind of discussion he\xe2\x80\x99s having with lawmakers and he\'ll continue to have, because he believes that there are Republicans who -- both those who have spoken publicly about it and others who have not -- who support the general premise of balance, who support the idea that we should reform our tax code in a way that eliminates these special breaks for the few and the wealthy and the well-connected, and to use that revenue for reducing our deficit so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t put the burden solely on senior citizens or families with children who have disabilities and the like.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a list for you.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be clear that the President is having these conversations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily helpful for individual senators to have those conversations specifically read out.\xc2\xa0 But, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to contact senators yourself.</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President open to having talks, or perhaps having talks already, with lawmakers specifically on finding ways to reduce the impacts of the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about the way the law is written and the fact that flexibility does not help the overall problem, because, as the Chairman of the Fed has said and many others have said, $85 billion withdrawn from our defense and nondefense discretionary budgets will have a negative impact.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what the CBO has said.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s what outside economists have said.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And certainly we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing some of those impacts already on regular folks out there who are trying to make ends meet but are finding out through warn notices or other advisories that they may lose their jobs, or they\xe2\x80\x99re going to lose some of their pay, or they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be furloughed.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re working with and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work with Congress towards achieving a compromise that eliminates that sequester, that achieves balanced deficit reduction, that does it in a way that allows our economy to grow and to help the middle class grow.\xc2\xa0 Because the President firmly believes that our economy is at its strongest and its best when it grows from the middle out and not the top down.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been proven by our history.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the effort that we\xe2\x80\x99re undertaking.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You talk about moving forward with gun control, immigration reform, but how do you do that when we\xe2\x80\x99re mired in this discussion about the budget?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you do it because you have to do it, because these issues matter and they\xe2\x80\x99re important.\xc2\xa0 And there are lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who believe that those issues are important and should be acted on, and we\xe2\x80\x99re working with members, both Republicans and Democrats, on those issues.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re very key to the President\xe2\x80\x99s second term agenda.\xc2\xa0 He thinks they\xe2\x80\x99re the right thing for the country, the right thing for our families, the right thing for our economy.\xc2\xa0 So he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work on those issues just as he will continue to work on enhancing our national security and continue to work on measures to, in spite of the impacts of the sequester, to improve job creation and economic growth, and help the middle class.</p>\n<p>It is unfortunate -- again, this is a wholly unnecessary decision that was made by Republicans to allow this to happen.\xc2\xa0 If you step back, what is somewhat remarkable about it, because you see Republicans calling it a victory -- a victory for the tea party or a victory because they stood up to the President on spending -- but remember what Republican goals are supposed to be.\xc2\xa0 Republicans budgets call for an increase in defense spending, not the dramatic cut we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing with the imposition of the sequester.\xc2\xa0 Republicans generally talk about increasing our border security presence, consistent with the way it\xe2\x80\x99s increased over the years, doubled since 2004.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, sequester does the opposite.\xc2\xa0 Republicans say they\xe2\x80\x99re the party of deficit reduction, long-term deficit reduction; the sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve that.\xc2\xa0 The Republicans say that they want entitlement reforms; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the sequester that achieves entitlement reform.\xc2\xa0 They say they want tax reform; there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing here that meets that objective.</p>\n<p>The President has put forward a proposal that does meet those objectives -- that achieves entitlement reform, that achieves tax reform in a balanced and fair way, that allows for the necessary level of funding for our national security interests, that allows for the continued strengthening of our border security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And he hopes that having achieved this empty victory, at least as they see it, the Republicans will understand that their goals are being unmet here, so not only are Americans suffering from this -- regular folks -- but their objectives are being unmet.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s an opportunity to change that dynamic, to do something that\'s good for the country, that\'s good for the economy, and that\'s to come together around a plan that would reduce our deficit in a balanced way, that would embrace both entitlement reform and tax reform towards deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>One of the things that\'s striking to me when you talk about the differences between these two parties is we\xe2\x80\x99re only asking that the Republicans do what the Speaker said he wanted to do just two months ago -- enact tax reform, achieve revenue by closing loopholes for the well-off and the well-connected, and use that money towards deficit reduction, a very conservative goal.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has put forward entitlement reforms -- some tough entitlement reforms that achieve savings.\xc2\xa0 And he, as part of a balanced approach, would commit to doing those, as his plan calls for, if Republicans would commit to what they said they wanted to do just a few months ago, which is tax reform in the name of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It is the conservative thing to do to use that money to reduce the deficit, not to funnel it into tax cuts for wealthy folks.\xc2\xa0 That seems counterproductive, to say the least.\xc2\xa0 So the President hopes the common-sense caucus expands in support of those ideas.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sequester really here to stay?\xc2\xa0 Because I think what you saw over the weekend is that you heard the two Republican leaders -- Mitch McConnell and John Boehner -- start talking about how we need to work through a continuing resolution.\xc2\xa0 They were confident that that would happen.\xc2\xa0 What makes you think that you can go back and do away with these cuts in the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, for all the reasons I just mentioned, and that is that the sequester doesn\xe2\x80\x99t achieve any of the stated objectives of the Republican Party, of Republican leaders.\xc2\xa0 It creates all the harm that Republican leaders said it would create when they were decrying the sequester just a few months ago.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They said they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to come back and do anything in terms of revenues.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s not one Republican, Mitch McConnell said, who is in favor of increasing revenues.\xc2\xa0 So it seems like you\'re at an impasse.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\'s false on its face since there are a number of Republicans who said they support tax reform that creates revenues, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve said so publicly, including very prominent Republicans.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.</p>\n<p>But the issue here is on the continuing resolution and funding the government.\xc2\xa0 We certainly support the idea that, as the President said from here, that we should not create another crisis on top of this one, another manufactured showdown; that Congress ought to pass a CR without drama, as it has a half dozen times since April of 2011 -- you probably didn\'t know it was that many times because there was no drama around it -- and to do that in a way that\'s practical and nonpolitical and consistent with the levels of the Budget Control Act.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what Congress does.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the Republicans do.\xc2\xa0 But the President, as you heard him say, would support that approach so that we don\'t add crisis upon crisis here.</p>\n<p>But to the broader question about dealing with the sequester, we need to do that, but we can do it if we follow the path that the public says it wants Republicans and Democrats to follow that the President has embraced, that bipartisan commissions have said is the right way to go, and we hope that we can achieve that.\xc2\xa0 Because if we do, we can really unleash some of the potential, the bottled up potential in our economy that exists -- as many economists have said that 2013 could be a very strong year economically if Washington would stop doing harm to the economy and start doing things that would help the economy.</p>\n<p><br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as a follow-up -- well, not really a follow-up, but maybe on a separate front.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I won\xe2\x80\x99t hold you to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Earlier this morning, Secretary Napolitano said that lines at some of the biggest airports over the weekend were 150 to 200 percent longer.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re asking Homeland Security for some kind of metrics to back that up.\xc2\xa0 But given the fact that there was sort of this back-and-forth over teacher layoffs with Secretary Duncan, and even the President talked about janitors that might be impacted at the Capitol -- that may not be the case -- what is the administration doing to make sure that these numbers are not hyped?\xc2\xa0 Because might that undercut your message?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing.\xc2\xa0 If you disagree with the CBO and with outside economic analysts who say that up to three-quarters of a million jobs will be lost, well, you should make that case.\xc2\xa0 Those are real people.\xc2\xa0 And of course many, many more will see their wages cut or their days on the job reduced.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s just a fact.\xc2\xa0 And the impact on the overall economy, that is an established, predicted fact by outside economists as well as the CBO.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no way to do what the sequester calls for and not create these negative effects.\xc2\xa0 There are just numerous examples already of what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense has informed Congress it will have to furlough 750,000 workers, and the Navy has told Virginia it will have to cancel maintenance on 11 ships.\xc2\xa0 The Army has begun curtailing training for all units except those deploying to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Justice transmitted approximately 115,000 furlough notices to all DOJ employees.\xc2\xa0 General Dynamics NASSCO, a major ship design, construction and repair company, mailed warn letters to about 1,040 employees in San Diego, Norfolk and Mayport, informing them that they could be indefinitely laid off in April -- at the end of April through the summer, due to the possible cancellation or delay of maintenance and repair work and uncertainty created by sequestration.</p>\n<p>These are the examples.\xc2\xa0 And I would refer you to the different agencies about how they\xe2\x80\x99ll be felt and who -- which individuals will be harmed by them.\xc2\xa0 On the issue of the janitors, it is -- if you work for an hourly wage, and you earn overtime, and you depend on that overtime to make ends meet, it is simply a fact that a reduction in overtime is a reduction in your pay.\xc2\xa0 Now, obviously there are some folks who -- for whom working hourly is a distant memory if it\xe2\x80\x99s a memory at all, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact for many families.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One question on the flexibility issue that\xe2\x80\x99s arising as House Republicans draft their continuing resolution -- to what degree is the administration interested in negotiating over flexibility for the defense side of this, which appears to be House Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 central focus as they craft this amendment onto a rather standard continuing resolution?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would like to wait to see what Congress produces.\xc2\xa0 As Gene Sperling said over the weekend, we want to see something that is practical and nonpolitical and consistent with the levels established in the Budget Control Act that both parties agreed to overwhelmingly.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to analyze hypothetical actions that they may take.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what they produce.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right.\xc2\xa0 On Iran, is there any thought being given here at the White House of cancelling the President\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Israel because there is not a government formed yet under Prime Minister Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have no scheduling changes to announce.\xc2\xa0 The President is looking forward to, very much, his trip to Israel and the region, and we\xe2\x80\x99re on course planning that trip.</p>\n<p>Q:\xc2\xa0 There were developments over the weekend -- announcements from Iran about 3,000 centrifuges at Natanz, the IAEA report saying that they can no longer say categorically that all of the research and development is for peaceful uses.\xc2\xa0 And Prime Minister Netanyahu just told AIPAC a few moments ago Iran is getting closer, sanctions haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked, and the red line time is getting -- drawing near.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get your evaluation of all those developments on this front over the weekend.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is no question, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times, that the window of opportunity for Iran will not remain open indefinitely.\xc2\xa0 There is opportunity here for Tehran to give up its nuclear weapons ambitions, to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions, to get right with the international community and thereby rejoin the international community and end its isolation from the world because of its behavior.\xc2\xa0 But that period of opportunity, as the President has said and as others have said, will not last forever.\xc2\xa0 And our policy is founded upon the goal that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon, and the President is very serious about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would you characterize Iran\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to the softened negotiating offer that the P5-plus-1 just made -- rebuffed it entirely -- this new -- Prime Minister Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s point -- even when there is an effort to delay or soften the conditions set before, Iran responds with nothing.\xc2\xa0 And his point is technologically they\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer.\xc2\xa0 I know this is a sort of catchphrase -- the window is not going to remain open indefinitely -- but the point seems to be, is it closing and are we getting to a point where this issue has to be resolved one way or the other, either through military means or some other means?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we take no option off the table, including the military option.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a point the President has made repeatedly, A.\xc2\xa0 B, there is no question that the window, the door, the period of opportunity here will not last forever and that the more that Iran flouts --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It can\'t last forever, that\xe2\x80\x99s obvious.\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get at is, is it getting -- are we getting to a point where decisions have to be made very soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question -- well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t characterize a timeframe here, but there is no question that as Iran continues to flout its responsibilities, as it continues to take seriously the insistence of the international community and fails to produce tangible progress in P5-plus-1 talks, that its opportunities to get right with the international community diminish, as does the timeframe in which they can do that.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to put a date certain -- an end date certain.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, there\'s a lot upon which that depends.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one of the President\'s top nominees, John Brennan, for the CIA, faces a committee vote tomorrow, I believe.\xc2\xa0 As you know, there have been lawmakers pushing for copies of these memos that show the legal underpinnings for the use of drone strikes.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration willing to share those memos with lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have, as you know, taken action to share advice from OLC to the relevant committee members.\xc2\xa0 We are working with the committee to provide information that is consistent with their requests, but obviously mindful of all the national security issues that are at stake in a situation like this.\xc2\xa0 And we look forward to John Brennan being confirmed -- passed out of committee and then confirmed by the Senate to be the next CIA director.\xc2\xa0 He is extraordinarily qualified for the position and he needs to get on the job.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that you\'ve shared, as you say, the Office of Legal Counsel advice on it.\xc2\xa0 But do you think the nomination can get through without the actual memos being shown to lawmakers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I can\'t get into a lot of detail about these issues.\xc2\xa0 We\'re working with the committee.\xc2\xa0 We have taken extraordinary measures in a unique situation to be forthcoming with information.\xc2\xa0 And we are continuing to work with the committee to meet their concerns.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Two other quick things.\xc2\xa0 More than a week has passed since the initial reports suggesting that some of the President\'s outside advisors were offering access to him for a $500,000 contribution to Organizing for Action, this outside group that is at least connected with the President and his former campaign aides like Jim Messina.\xc2\xa0 My question is groups like Common Cause, which are usually not very friendly to the President\'s opposition, shall we say, has said that this group should be shut down altogether.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us any idea whether the President thinks that\'s a good idea?\xc2\xa0 Is he concerned about the perception out there?\xc2\xa0 Are you trying to push back on the idea that they will get access for $500,000?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I pushed back on it and I\'ll push back on it again.\xc2\xa0 Any notion that there is a set price for a meeting with the President of the United States is just wrong.\xc2\xa0 As you know, Organizing for Action was set up to promote the President\'s public policy agenda.\xc2\xa0 Therefore, as anyone would expect, the President would likely meet with their representatives to discuss his agenda.\xc2\xa0 But again, any notion that there\'s a price for meeting with the President is simply wrong.</p>\n<p>I would send specific questions about how they do their fundraising to the organization.\xc2\xa0 But it is worth knowing that they are going beyond what is required by disclosing donors and not accepting any funds from lobbyists.\xc2\xa0 The bottom line here is that this is a separate organization, as we\'ve noted, the existence of which is perfectly appropriate.\xc2\xa0 And the White House will engage with it consistent with the way we engage with a whole host of other outside constituencies.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But basically, people could still give money to this outside group as long as it\'s not directly attached to access. You\'ve got nothing to do with the money that\'s going in there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The White House sets the President\'s schedule. And there is no price to meet with the President.\xc2\xa0 Organizations have fundraising.\xc2\xa0 They raise money and this one has committed to disclosing its fundraising activities.\xc2\xa0 But I would refer you to them for more on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last thing, on sequester.\xc2\xa0 At the top of this you said something to the effect of Republicans made a choice here to let these sequester cuts go through, the context of it.\xc2\xa0 The President has made choices as well, obviously, including the fact that his own staff came up with the idea for sequester.\xc2\xa0 I understand Republicans ended up voting for it and they bear some responsibility here as well it needs to be said.\xc2\xa0 However, does anyone here at the White House regret the fact that people inside this White House came up with this idea in the first place?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Senator Gramm and Rudman came up with the idea back in the 1980s.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They\'ve been out of power a long time.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And let\'s be clear -- and those who were on the inside and those of you who covered it closely will remember that Republicans were pushing for a trigger, a hard trigger as part of the negotiations to avert a default.\xc2\xa0 The White House proposed numerous triggers that included revenues.\xc2\xa0 Republicans absolutely, adamantly, categorically refused to include revenues in the triggers, a position that may sound familiar.\xc2\xa0 They insisted on a spending-cut-only trigger.\xc2\xa0 That is what sequester is.\xc2\xa0 It is a spending-cut-only trigger.\xc2\xa0 The fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s called that was because that\'s what it was called back in the 1980s under the deficit reduction package known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings that President Reagan signed when they had a trigger, a spending-cuts-only trigger that was evenly divided between defense spending and nondefense spending.</p>\n<p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s true that that was put on the table as part of the demand for a spending-cuts-only trigger that \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s do it the way they did it back under President Reagan,\xe2\x80\x9d our team said to Republicans, thinking that might be appealing.\xc2\xa0 And it was so appealing that John Boehner said he got 98 percent of what he wanted.\xc2\xa0 Every House Republican leader voted for it enthusiastically, and Speaker Boehner said he was pretty pleased with the outcome.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is all pretty irrelevant.\xc2\xa0 What is relevant is that it was never supposed to be policy, and Republicans themselves on so many occasions that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we\xe2\x80\x99ve all lost count said that we had to do everything we can to avert sequester, that it would be enormously damaging.\xc2\xa0 Speaker Boehner just a few weeks ago in the Wall Street Journal said it would do harm to our national defense and would cost thousands of jobs.\xc2\xa0 And he\xe2\x80\x99s right.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it was a choice to allow sequester to take effect rather than embrace the idea that the American people strongly embrace, that a majority of Republicans strongly embrace out in the country, which is that we can close a few loopholes for the wealthy and well-connected, cap a few deductions, and achieve balanced deficit reduction in a way that would eliminate the sequester entirely.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just do that.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s do that and Republicans can say that they achieved some very important goals that are elemental to Republican and conservative philosophy, which is we need deficit reduction, we need entitlement reform -- and the President says, I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet you halfway towards that -- and we need tax reform and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that.\xc2\xa0 So let\xe2\x80\x99s do it in a bipartisan, balanced way.</p>\n<p>Jon, then Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, how big a priority -- how high a priority is it for the President to win back the House of Representatives with the Democrats?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously interested in the success of Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But I noted the story that probably prompted your question, and I think it goes without saying that the President wants those in his party to do well, but it is not a focus of his particularly at this point.\xc2\xa0 He is focused on trying to get a bipartisan consensus around some very important policy objectives:\xc2\xa0 balanced deficit reduction that helps our economy grow and create jobs; comprehensive immigration reform that helps our economy and the middle class; common-sense measures that reduce gun violence in this country; investments in clean energy technology that help build industries here in this country and help deal with climate change for the future.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on right now.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does he agree with the head of the Democratic House Campaign Committee who said, the President understands -- and he said this was based on a conversation with the President -- the President understands that to get anything done we need to get a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President certainly believes that, as other Presidents before him have believed, that it is easier sometimes to enact your agenda when you have more members of your party in Congress.\xc2\xa0 But it is also the President\xe2\x80\x99s belief, and it is established in fact in recent history, that you can achieve important policy objectives with divided government, with, in his case, Republican leadership in the House and Republican semi-control in the Senate through the filibuster.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s done, and he hopes to continue to do that.</p>\n<p>I mean, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking here about opportunities on immigration reform and other issues, including balanced deficit reduction, that require bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And based on what we know in terms of the progress the Gang of Eight is making, or the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s being made in moving forward on reducing gun violence, and the progress that is represented by the voices of those Republicans who say they embrace what the majority of the country embraces, and they embrace what the majority of Republicans embrace when it comes to deficit reduction, that we can do these things.\xc2\xa0 And the President -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what his focus is.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To the Republicans who say that the President is -- they\xe2\x80\x99re worried the President going into any one of those issues you just mentioned, going into this not necessarily to get anything done but to position himself to have a better run at the mid-term elections, I mean, just to quote Steve Israel again, \xe2\x80\x9cto have a legacy in 2016 he will need a House majority in 2014 and it has to start now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, it is just not accurate that the President doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want these accomplishments.\xc2\xa0 He is expending great political capital and energy on the proposition that he wants immigration reform done in a bipartisan way and done early. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has pushed so hard for the Senate to move forward in its efforts.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s why he has pushed on gun violence measures and put forward a comprehensive package so early in his -- the first year of his second term.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why he continues to have on the table the offer that he made to Speaker Boehner when it comes to completing the $4-trillion job here of deficit reduction over 10 years that would help achieve that fiscally sustainable path that we want for our economy over the next decade.\xc2\xa0 These are things he believes we can do very soon if bipartisanship and a spirit of compromise on behalf of the American people is realized on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So on that offer, I mean, you\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right that some prominent Republicans have come out in recent days and said that they could live with a plan that increased tax revenue -- not to replace the sequester, but as part of kind of a renewed effort at the grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 So are we going to see an effort --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But that would eliminate the sequester, which the whole -- the whole idea behind the --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it would be bigger than just eliminate.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re exactly right.\xc2\xa0 But it would be bigger.\xc2\xa0 So will there be an effort to jumpstart a grand bargain-type series of talks with Republicans in the coming weeks or months to achieve just that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99d hesitate to place labels on things.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that the President is interested in moving forward on deficit reduction that pairs the twin objectives of entitlement reform and tax reform in the way that his proposal does, in a way that is consistent with Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin and others who have put forward ideas and proposals in a bipartisan way.\xc2\xa0 And it presents an opportunity for both Republicans and Democrats to achieve some important objectives -- objectives that are important to their parties, as well as to the country, and to move forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that\'s what the weekend calls were about?\xc2\xa0 The grand bargain, not --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the weekend calls were about trying to find common ground on the way to deal with the sequester and balanced deficit reduction.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The big deal.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But they\'re linked.\xc2\xa0 First of all, the big deal has been partly accomplished.\xc2\xa0 So when the grand bargain negotiations began with Speaker Boehner, the goal was $4 trillion.\xc2\xa0 Now we\xe2\x80\x99re $2.5 trillion along that road.\xc2\xa0 So it may be the petite bargain -- I guess if you go all French.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\'ll leave that entirely to you, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But seriously, $1.5 trillion in deficit reduction, the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would achieve $1.8 trillion in further deficit reduction in a balanced way.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bowles-Simpson want $2.4 trillion now at this point.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve moved the goalpost a little bit to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that more work going forward will need to be done as we deal with our fiscal challenges.\xc2\xa0 But the $4 trillion in deficit reduction set as a goal by Speaker Boehner and President Obama and by many economists on the inside and outside of government can be achieved, and then some, if Republicans would embrace the President\xe2\x80\x99s compromise proposal that would do some tough things on entitlements, as well as spending and on tax reform.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you understand the difference.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s trying to create a Republican groundswell for grand bargain talks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s just trying to find some common ground around the basic common-sense notion that we can do this in a balanced way because he knows that there are significant -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a significant amount of support for that approach around the country.</p>\n<p>April.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.\xc2\xa0 Peter, then April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April, that was kind of, thank you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m curious since our time --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Stand up, April.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- since our time with you is limited right now, if the President had any reaction or had a chance to watch some of the conversations with Dennis Rodman who just returned from North Korea, and if the President believes that this in some way undermines the government\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in trying to deal with that country.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Peter, the United States has direct channels of communications with the DPRK.\xc2\xa0 And instead of spending money on celebrity sporting events to entertain the elites of that country, the North Korean regime should focus on the well-being of its own people who have been starved, imprisoned, and denied their human rights.</p>\n<p>We have urged the North Korean leadership to heed President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call to choose the path of peace and come into compliance with its international obligations.\xc2\xa0 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s actions, however, directly violate United Nations Security Council resolutions and threaten international peace and security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dennis Rodman carried a message from Kim Jong-un.\xc2\xa0 He said to call.\xc2\xa0 So does the President have any intention --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, we have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did he make of -- what did he make of Dennis Rodman being the ambassador to North Korea?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have a readout specific to the President to give to you.\xc2\xa0 I think that what I just said makes clear that North Korea ought to be focusing on its own citizens and opportunities to improve their lives.\xc2\xa0 And the United States has channels of communications directly with the DPRK and those are the channels we choose to employ.</p>\n<p>April.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I want to go back to sequestration and then to something with Mitt Romney.\xc2\xa0 You said sequestration will have serious consequences.\xc2\xa0 With that, what is the estimated number of Americans who will fall out of the middle-class status because of sequestration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t have that breakdown.\xc2\xa0 You may look at what -- some of the analysis that has been done by outside economic organizations like Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and Macroeconomics Advisers.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if they break it down that way.\xc2\xa0 Certainly, if 750,000 Americans lose their jobs, that could have an effect on the size of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And that would be highly counterproductive to the stated objectives of both parties in Washington.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Shaving half a percentage point off our GDP growth would be hugely harmful and would have ripple effects.\xc2\xa0 There are jobs that we will know are specifically affected by the sequester in our defense industries and other areas that are directly linked to federal funding.\xc2\xa0 But then, there will be the jobs that are lost or not created because the sequester goes into effect -- around businesses that close -- small businesses that close or cut back, support services around them whether they\'re restaurants or barbershops and the like, that are affected and don\'t hire a new worker because there are fewer patronizing their businesses.</p>\n<p>And that\'s the shame of all of this, is that there will be so many regular Americans who will be negatively affected by this wholly unnecessary imposition of the sequester.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And the next question really fast -- what do you say about Mitt Romney\'s revelation that was televised last night that he did not win the state of Ohio because he failed to attract the black and Hispanic vote with his "47 percent" comment?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I actually confess that I didn\'t see that.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that Mitt Romney didn\'t win Ohio.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tDonovan.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 George Will said, "I will do many things for my country and my profession.\xc2\xa0 I will not take seriously Mr. Carney."\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\'s funny.\xc2\xa0 I did see that.\xc2\xa0 It\'s funny you raised that.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I love the structure of the sentence. It\'s very George Will-ian.\xc2\xa0 But I have a lot of respect for George Will.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve been on the panel on "This Week" with him many times in my previous life.\xc2\xa0 I think he is a very smart guy.\xc2\xa0 And despite the fact that a few days before the election I think he predicted a Romney landslide very confidently on television -- 321-217 over the President -- built on a victory in Minnesota, which the President ended up winning by more than 7 percent, I will continue to take George Will seriously.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t12:57 P.M.
