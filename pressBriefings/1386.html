BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Hello.\xc2\xa0 Thank you all for joining us on this trip.\xc2\xa0 So just a little housekeeping at the top here.\xc2\xa0 Upon arrival in Maine, the President will be greeted by Governor Baldacci and his wife Karen; Mayor Nicholas Mavodones; and Congress -- members of Congress Michaud and Pingree.\xc2\xa0 At the speech he will be introduced by Mainer Karen Mills, the head of the Small Business Administration.\xc2\xa0 The audience will be about 2,500 people.\xc2\xa0 Two thousand of those tickets were made available to the general public.\xc2\xa0 About 500 of those were handed out by local electeds and officials.</p>\n<p>In Boston the President will be greeted by Lilly Ledbetter.\xc2\xa0 And then as you know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the events with the DNC once we get there into Boston.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 At the event, yes.\xc2\xa0 So -- and at some point today the President will be addressing the floods that are having such an impact on the region.\xc2\xa0 So with that, let me take your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Hu Jintao and his decision to attend the nuclear conference -- do you have any reaction to that?\xc2\xa0 Do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to help you with your broader outreach with China?\xc2\xa0 And is there any connection or is it going to influence your decision on whether you name China a currency manipulator on the April 15 report?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, obviously we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that China is coming to the event.\xc2\xa0 As we have long said, we have an important relationship with China, one in which there are many issues of mutual concern that we work on together.\xc2\xa0 But there also will be times where we disagree.\xc2\xa0 I think this proves the point that despite those disagreements, we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation.\xc2\xa0 I think that China understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s in their best interests that there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, and that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be working on.</p>\n<p>As it relates to currency, I would just point you to what the President said.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll just read his quote:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cChina moving to a more market-oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 But as for anything that has to do with the currency, I would point you over to Treasury.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So no connection?\xc2\xa0 There is no connection?\xc2\xa0 You don\xe2\x80\x99t see it influencing your decision?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 I would just talk to Treasury about their decision-making -- their process on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any comment out of the White House on the decision yesterday on the warrantless wiretapping for the Islamic charity?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Department of Justice is still reviewing the decision.\xc2\xa0 I would just point out that the Attorney General has made a -- has implemented a series of reforms that help to balance the importance of national security with issues of transparency.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a point not to abuse this privilege and have made great strides in reforming it.</p>\n<p>But I would direct you to the Department of Justice for when they get through their review --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, can you gauge in any way what the President has to show for these post-bill signing trips?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a long process.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re just a week away from the bill being signed into law essentially, and the President thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we continue to make sure that the American people know exactly what they\xe2\x80\x99re getting out of this bill in the short term; what it\xe2\x80\x99s going to mean for their families, for businesses, and for the American economy in the long term.</p>\n<p>And so the President\xe2\x80\x99s objective is to make sure the American people know a little bit more about what the benefits are in the bill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When or how are you going to know that you\xe2\x80\x99ve closed the loop on this?\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about the small business aspect today; he talked about the insurance companies.\xc2\xa0 Is he just going to continue to hammer away at this for the foreseeable future?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue to talk to the American people about it, and the American people are going to continue to receive the benefits as the bill gets phased in.\xc2\xa0 Nobody thought that overnight that a bill would get passed and suddenly people would understand all the benefits.\xc2\xa0 We went through a year and change of a long and contentious debate.\xc2\xa0 There were a lot of mistruths out there.\xc2\xa0 There were a lot of things that just frankly were not true that were said about this proposal -- well, this now law -- and the President is committed to making sure that people know what\xe2\x80\x99s in it.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of that process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How much of it, though, is a calculation for the midterms?\xc2\xa0 I mean, how much is he doing this to lay the groundwork for somebody who might be in a tough reelection fight?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say that this is a lot more about the policy than it is about the politics.\xc2\xa0 The President didn\xe2\x80\x99t get into this because he thought it would be the politically popular thing to do.\xc2\xa0 I mean, if you look at the polling over the course of the last year, obviously that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what guided his decision to go about this.</p>\n<p>But -- so I would say that this is really about making sure the American people know what they have at stake here and what they get out of this law.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that supposed to be done before it was passed?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Like I said, we went through a long process where there was a pretty contentious back-and-forth between the proponents of the bill and the opponents of that bill.\xc2\xa0 Well, now that bill is law, and we have to make sure that we get in there and we dispel some of the rumors and some of the myths about it, and underscore some of the benefits the American people are getting out of it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, could you talk a bit about the timing of the drilling announcement?\xc2\xa0 Some environmentalists say perhaps the President should have waited and used the drilling as leverage, maybe, in climate change negotiations.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say, A, this was driven in part by a deadline that we were up against; and B, the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a matter of horse trading over what he thought he could get out of this or that.\xc2\xa0 It was driven by what he thought was the right policy for a comprehensive energy policy that puts our country on the right path towards more renewable energy, less dependence on foreign oil, and creating jobs of the future in the 21st century.</p>\n<p>So I think that anybody who looked at what\xe2\x80\x99s in that proposal shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been particularly shocked that the President was for all those things.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you go about horse trading something that everybody knows you\xe2\x80\x99re for already.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Bill, do you have any reaction to Karzai\xe2\x80\x99s comments that foreigners were to blame for the fraud in the Afghan election last year?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 We went through a pretty long and rigorous process in that election.\xc2\xa0 International observers and folks on the ground in Afghanistan took a look at the elections.\xc2\xa0 There were charges made of fraud; there were a lot of ballots that were disqualified.\xc2\xa0 And at the end of the process ended up with a winner in that race, who is recognized both by the Afghan people and by the international community.</p>\n<p>And so we\xe2\x80\x99re satisfied with that effort.\xc2\xa0 And I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re just going to continue to work with the Afghan government on helping to strengthen it and helping to secure that country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Comments like that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be consistent with the message of the President to Karzai on Sunday.\xc2\xa0 Has he got the message on corruption, do you think?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that the President and this government have made clear that there are issues with governance in that country that could certainly be improved.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been having conversations with them for months.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to make some progress.\xc2\xa0 The President is glad for that progress, but there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a lot more work to do, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the White House reaction to China joining U.N. talks on Iran sanctions?\xc2\xa0 How important step is that for developing consequences for Iran?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a very important step.\xc2\xa0 The President feels that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to have -- to unite the global community in a way that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been united before in putting pressure on Iran and halting their drive towards nuclear weapons.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue that process, and the President thinks that this spring we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be able to be in a place where there\xe2\x80\x99s an agreement of those nations to apply real pressure to Iran.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know if Snowe and Collins were invited to the event in Portland today?\xc2\xa0 I know they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be there, but were they invited at all?</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Yes, they were invited.\xc2\xa0 No, they won\xe2\x80\x99t be there.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>MR. BURTON:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n2:00 P.M.
