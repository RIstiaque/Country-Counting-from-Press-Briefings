EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST: Good afternoon and welcome aboard Air Force One as we embark on a 24-hour trip to Atlanta and Tampa, where the President will be engaged on two significant national security priorities.\xc2\xa0 The first is stepping up our whole-of-government approach to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\xc2\xa0 And the second is leading an international coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL.</p>\n<p>First, in Atlanta, the President will meet with doctors, nurses, scientists and other leading medical experts at the CDC who have, at the President\xe2\x80\x99s direction, been focused on responding to the Ebola outbreak since it was first reported back in March.\xc2\xa0 Many of you saw the reports this morning that the President has directed the Department of Defense to deploy significant logistical engineering and training support to expand the capacity of the ongoing response.\xc2\xa0 This order from the President is consistent with his view that responding to the Ebola outbreak is a top national security priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Many of you may be interested to know that this morning, before departing the White House, the President met briefly in the Oval Office with Dr. Kent Brantly and his wife, Amber.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Brantly serves as the Medical Director for the Samaritan\xe2\x80\x99s Purse Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia, Libya -- Liberia.\xc2\xa0 And as was reported, he tested positive for the Ebola virus back in July.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Brantly was transported back to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on August 2nd.\xc2\xa0 He was treated and released on August 21st, free of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Dr. Brantly is in Washington, D.C., to testify before Congress today regarding the Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>Second, tomorrow, in Tampa, the President will visit MacDill Air Force Base -- it\xe2\x80\x99s the headquarters of Central Command -- to discuss the plan for building an international coalition to degrade and destroy ISIL.\xc2\xa0 After announcing his decision to broaden our efforts against ISIL in his address to the nation, the President asked his team to arrange for him to travel to Central Command to get an in-person briefing from General Austin and other CENTCOM personnel about some of the operational details of the military effort that the President has ordered.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>General Austin has returned from the region to lead the briefing.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel will participate as well.\xc2\xa0 However, this is just one aspect of the President\xe2\x80\x99s activities at MacDill.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll also meet with senior national representatives from those nations located within Central Command\xe2\x80\x99s scope of responsibility.\xc2\xa0 Many of these nations will be an important part of the international coalition that the President will be leading against ISIL.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Commander-in-Chief is also looking forward to spending time with the servicemen and women of MacDill Air Force Base and share with them the gratitude of the nation for their service and sacrifice to our country and to our security.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, you also know -- sorry about that -- you also know that prior to departing the White House today, the President met with General John Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and Brett McGurk, who is the Deputy Special Presidential Envoy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President underscored the importance of maximizing coordination with allies and partners to build a strong coalition with broad international participation.\xc2\xa0 The President stressed that the comprehensive approach to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL requires a wide range of political, diplomatic, military, economic and other efforts.\xc2\xa0 He also expressed his deep appreciation for the work and sacrifice of U.S. servicemen and women, as well as the diplomats engaged in the struggle to counter ISIL.\xc2\xa0 The President thanked General Allen for his many years of service in uniform and for continuing since his retirement to serve his country in a civilian capacity.</p>\n<p>So with all of that, thank you for indulging me.\xc2\xa0 Let me go to your questions.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I wanted to ask you about General Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s testimony today.\xc2\xa0 He said that under certain circumstances he could see himself asking the President to allow advisers on the ground to participate in combat operations.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the President is open to that, if that recommendation would come from General Dempsey.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Jim, I think, as was clear from General Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s remarks, that he was referring to a hypothetical scenario in which there might be a future situation in which he might make a tactical recommendation to the President as it relates to the use of ground troops.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s the responsibility of the President\xe2\x80\x99s military advisers to plan and consider all the wide range of contingencies.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also the responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief to set out a clear policy.\xc2\xa0 And the President has been clear about what that policy is.\xc2\xa0 He reiterated it on a number of occasions; most recently, I believe in his address to the nation on Wednesday night, which is that the President does not believe that it would be in the best interest of our national security to deploy American ground troops in a combat role in Iraq and Syria.\xc2\xa0 That policy has not changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So under no circumstances would there be boots on the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, precision is important here.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has been very clear about is the role of American forces in Iraq.\xc2\xa0 The President has deployed American servicemen and women -- a limited number of them -- to serve in an advise-and-assist capacity, to staff joint operation centers, to defend the embassy in Baghdad and the consulate in Erbil.\xc2\xa0 So there are American service personnel in Iraq.</p>\n<p>There are also, obviously, American servicemen and women who are engaged in some of the air combat operations, right?\xc2\xa0 There are more than 150 strikes, I believe, that have been announced by Central Command that have taken place at the direction of the President.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But what he\xe2\x80\x99s been very specific and precise about is that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role into Iraq or Syria.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- he would say no to General Dempsey under that, the hypothetical that General Dempsey laid out.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s also clear from General Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s remarks that he has confidence in the strategy that\'s already been put in place.\xc2\xa0 It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise that he has confidence in that strategy because he has advised the President over the course of the last few months that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on this -- on the strategy.\xc2\xa0 So the strategy that is in place is one that has the confidence of General Dempsey.\xc2\xa0 At least the military aspect of the strategy that has been deployed so far has resulted in some important benefits.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about how the use of American military air power has been successful in backing up Iraqi security forces as they blunted an advance on Erbil a few months ago, or at least earlier this summer.\xc2\xa0 American airstrikes were instrumental in supporting Iraqi security forces as they retook the Mosul Dam.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also seen the precise deployment of American military air power to prevent humanitarian disasters in Sinjar Mountain and Amerli, where ISIL fighters were poised to carry out a genocide against religious or ethnic minorities in Iraq.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a strategy that\'s been deployed with successful results so far.\xc2\xa0 But as we broaden out this campaign to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL, the President and his team are insistent on working with the support of an international coalition to succeed in this mission.\xc2\xa0 And the President is confident that this mission can be successfully executed without deploying American servicemen and women in a combat role on the ground in Iraq and Syria.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you further characterize the President\xe2\x80\x99s visit to MacDill tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Is it a decision meeting?\xc2\xa0 Is it a tactical meeting?\xc2\xa0 Both?\xc2\xa0 What does he expect to accomplish -- hope to accomplish?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the President himself after he does all the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing at MacDill with CENTCOM personnel.\xc2\xa0 It\'s important to remember that in addition to the briefing that he\'ll receive from General Austin and other senior officials at CENTCOM, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend some time with those who are working to build this broader international coalition and spend some time with our servicemen and women who have made so many sacrifices for our country.\xc2\xa0 So it\'s important to remember that this is a visit where he\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot on the agenda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the President\xe2\x80\x99s -- back to General Dempsey\xe2\x80\x99s comments.\xc2\xa0 You laid out the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy and said it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed.\xc2\xa0 But did his remarks today indicate that maybe the Pentagon is not on the same page with the White House on this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\'m confident that if you asked General Dempsey if he\xe2\x80\x99s on the same page as the Commander-in-Chief that he would say that he is.\xc2\xa0 But I will let him speak for himself.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Can you shed some light on the 3,000 troops that will be sent?\xc2\xa0 What will they be doing?\xc2\xa0 And most specifically, will any of them be handling victims, either alive or dead, and themselves put at risk for contracting it?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\'s a good question.\xc2\xa0 For very specific details, I\'d refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s also a factsheet that I can share with you.\xc2\xa0 But as a general matter, let me say that the Department of Defense has significant logistical capabilities.\xc2\xa0 And those who are trying to respond to this outbreak in West Africa are operating in a very difficult environment.\xc2\xa0 And the use of Department of Defense personnel and assets to strengthen the logistical network in place that\'s supporting that effort will significantly expand the capacity of that effort.</p>\n<p>We also anticipate that the commitment of DOD personnel and resources will galvanize the international community; that people around the world, knowing that the Department of Defense is involved in this effort, can have some more confidence that the effort is well run, that it will be well executed, and that they can contribute to the effort knowing that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have the necessary resources to succeed.</p>\n<p>As it relates to your specific question, Department of Defense personnel will not be responsible for providing direct patient care.\xc2\xa0 What they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is they will be serving in a function that will allow them to capitalize on their unique capabilities to enhance logistical support, to provide some training and also some engineering support as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, can you explain where those 3,000 troops will be?\xc2\xa0 Is it primarily in Liberia or will they be spread out among all of the countries that are most affected by this?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, for a detailed answer to this question I refer you to the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 But I know that there is an Intermediate Staging Base, I believe it\'s called, that will be stood up in Senegal.\xc2\xa0 Senegal, you\xe2\x80\x99ll note, is not one of the countries that currently is affected by Ebola -- or it\'s not a country in which anyone has contracted Ebola at this point.\xc2\xa0 So there will be a substantial contingent of these 3,000 Department of Defense personnel that will be at this Intermediate Staging Base.\xc2\xa0 There will be some other locations in Liberia where American military personnel will also be located.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But, again, they will be providing some logistical support, some training, even some construction or engineering assistance that they can provide, but they will not be providing direct patient care.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the funding, the factsheet and your colleagues on the call last night said that the DOD would be requesting a reprogramming of $500 million.\xc2\xa0 The word \xe2\x80\x9crequest\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that maybe that\'s not a done deal.\xc2\xa0 Is that true, or is that money definitely going towards that?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me take a crack at answering your question.\xc2\xa0 There is a request that has been made by the administration for supporting this effort, and we\'re confident we\xe2\x80\x99ll have the resources that we need to carry out this specific mission.</p>\n<p>Let me say one other thing.\xc2\xa0 This is a bit of a tangent, but this is also an important thing I wanted to convey today.\xc2\xa0 The other thing that the House of Representatives is currently debating is whether or not to give the President or this administration Title 10 authority that would allow the Department of Defense to play an active role in training Syrian opposition fighters.\xc2\xa0 We are pleased with the bipartisan support that we\xe2\x80\x99ve received so far for that authority, and we know -- we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased with the progress that that legislation that would give this authority is making through the House.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s been some discussion about language that is included in this proposal by the Chairman of the House Arms Services Committee, Buck McKeon.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people to understand that the language that the Chairman has inserted is something that is the result of bipartisan efforts to advance this proposal.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s primarily related to some oversight in reporting functions.\xc2\xa0 The President and his administration across a wide range of areas has demonstrated a willingness and even a desire to work with Congress as they conduct their proper oversight.</p>\n<p>So as a general matter, let me just say that the language suggested by Chairman McKeon is one that has bipartisan support, and is one that is supported by this administration.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will act quickly to pass this measure and give the administration the authority that is needed to begin the effort to train Syrian opposition fighters.\xc2\xa0 We have secured commitments from the Saudis to host this training operation, and we\xe2\x80\x99d like to move quickly to set up this operation.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will act quickly to give the administration the authority that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And one last one on Ebola.\xc2\xa0 Why did it take so long to get this big effort underway?\xc2\xa0 And is it a sign that the United States and the President see this threat as growing and being a bigger national security item than even he said a few weeks ago?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more from the President and from some of the experts at the CDC today on this.\xc2\xa0 The fact is, the CDC has responded aggressively to the situation since the initial reports of an Ebola outbreak became public back in March.\xc2\xa0 So this has been a sustained effort that has been underway for some time.\xc2\xa0 I mentioned during the briefing yesterday that in response to this Ebola outbreak, the CDC executed the largest ever deployment of CDC personnel to try to respond to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing now is the largest ever outbreak of Ebola.\xc2\xa0 And because it is a top national security priority, the President has directed the Department of Defense to significantly ramp up the kind of assistance they\xe2\x80\x99re providing to those who are trying to respond to this effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But couldn\xe2\x80\x99t a ramp-up two weeks ago have maybe prevented a lot more deaths?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jeff, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is -- and what we have seen from the United States is an aggressive response to this situation that started all the way back in March.\xc2\xa0 And the reason for that is simply -- well, I think there are two reasons for that.\xc2\xa0 The first is the President has identified it as a top national security priority.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The second thing it illustrates, however, is that the United States is the world\xe2\x80\x99s indispensable nation.\xc2\xa0 And the United States, and our military in particular, has unique capabilities and a capacity to offer assistance in very remote parts of the world.\xc2\xa0 And we do anticipate that it will galvanize the global health community and nations around the world as they consider how and whether to contribute to this Ebola response effort.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President is pleased to lead this country as we play a leading role in the global response to this Ebola outbreak.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, in terms of timing, do you know when those 17 treatment facilities will be up and running?\xc2\xa0 And also, do you have a sense of how long those 3,000 military personnel might be deployed to this region?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have that information, but the Department of Defense may be able to offer up some more details on that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, quickly, just a quick question.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to have anything for us tonight more on the meeting tomorrow?\xc2\xa0 Any conference call, statement, or anything further?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate that.</p>\n<p>Stephen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Russia.\xc2\xa0 The ruble is falling to record lows.\xc2\xa0 Is this a goal of U.S. sanctions policy and do you see this building any political pressure on Putin?\xc2\xa0 You spoke last week about striking at his inner circle.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Our goal from the beginning has been to impose economic costs and to isolate Russia for their actions in Ukraine.\xc2\xa0 These reports of the declining value of their currency is consistent with the impact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far of the sanctions regime that\xe2\x80\x99s been put in place by the United States in close coordination with our allies in Europe.\xc2\xa0 And it is evidence that Russia is paying a price for their destabilizing actions in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Thanks, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Buckle up for landing.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:44 P.M.
