Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>1:17 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a summer crowd.\xc2\xa0 I like that.\xc2\xa0 I noticed during the briefing yesterday how hot it was.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m glad it\xe2\x80\x99s fixed.\xc2\xa0 I thought maybe I was coming down with malaria a little after the fact, since I forgot to take my medicine for a while.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The last one today.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Really?\xc2\xa0 I skipped -- I think I\xe2\x80\x99m done for, I skipped two or three days.\xc2\xa0 So if I break out in a sweat, it\xe2\x80\x99s not because of the questions.\xc2\xa0 But I\xe2\x80\x99m glad the air-conditioning is back on.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you are, too.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I have no announcements beyond that to make, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the Associated Press.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Jay.\xc2\xa0 I wanted to start with Egypt.\xc2\xa0 A few new developments -- the interim president named a prime minister; ElBaradei has been named vice president.\xc2\xa0 I understand the President had a principals meeting yesterday afternoon and there\xe2\x80\x99s bipartisan support on the Hill for suspending aid to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator McCain have all expressed support for suspending it.\xc2\xa0 Senator Leahy pointed out that the U.S. law prohibits aid after military coups.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>As you said yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the U.S. interest to halt aid but that it is also a fact that U.S. law prohibits aid after a military coup.\xc2\xa0 So how is the White House squaring that?\xc2\xa0 What did the President\xe2\x80\x99s discussions lead him to decide yesterday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, you are correct that the President has been meeting regularly with his national security team about the situation in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 You are also correct, as I said yesterday, that we have not made a determination about what to call or label the events in Egypt that led to the change in government there.\xc2\xa0 And I tried to be very straightforward about the elephant in the room, if you will, by saying there\xe2\x80\x99s an elephant in the room here and it is in our national interest, the best interests of the United States, and the best interests, in our view, of our goal of assisting the Egyptian people in their transition to democracy to take the time necessary to evaluate the situation before making such a determination.</p>\n<p>And this issue goes beyond the question of our financial assistance to Egypt -- $1.5 billion, roughly, that Congress provides, $1.3 billion of which is security assistance, roughly. It goes to the essence of our relationship with Egypt, our decades-long partnership with Egypt, and the fact that Egyptians are looking to us for guidance and assistance as they make this very difficult transition to democracy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I acknowledge that this is a complex and difficult situation and that we are handling it cautiously for that reason. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make a precipitous decision.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would be in the best interests of the United States to change the assistance program quickly or immediately.\xc2\xa0 Rather, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take the time necessary to evaluate it.\xc2\xa0 We will review our obligations under law.\xc2\xa0 We will consult with Congress and then move forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But for now, we are engaging with Egyptian authorities.\xc2\xa0 We are engaging with leaders around the region.\xc2\xa0 We are calling on all parties in Egypt to resist violence, to protest -- if you are a protester in Egypt, to protest peacefully.\xc2\xa0 We are calling on the military to use maximum restraint.\xc2\xa0 We are calling on all parties not only to resist violence, but to avoid incitement to violence.\xc2\xa0 And we are calling on all parties to participate in a dialogue and a process towards reconciliation, because there is a dangerous level of political polarization right now in Egypt, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, and the best hope for Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s future is for that polarization to give way to reconciliation.</p>\n<p>We believe that Egypt will only be able to emerge from this crisis if its people come together to find a nonviolent and inclusive path forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given the relatively lack of ambiguity in U.S. law on aid and you guys trying to figure out, as you said, how to deal with the elephant in the room, is the President, is the administration pressing other governments in the region to increase their aid to Egypt so that you have more flexibility on the decision you ultimately make?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to look at the issue of aid and to look at reports about other assistance provided by other countries, and acknowledge that the numerical figure here is not the issue.\xc2\xa0 It is about our policy objectives and our relationship with Egypt and the Egyptian people and what policy moving forward best supports our objectives here of assisting Egypt in its transition to democracy, assisting Egypt in its quick -- hopefully quick -- but responsible return to a democratically elected civilian government and to democratic governance.</p>\n<p>And we are -- that\xe2\x80\x99s the focus we\xe2\x80\x99re on.\xc2\xa0 So when it comes to our consultations with other governments in the region, we are having those conversations and consultations at every level.\xc2\xa0 You can expect the President will be engaging with leaders in the region, as well as, of course, the other members of his national security team with their counterparts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is all about our effort to urge all parties forward towards a process of reconciliation.\xc2\xa0 We are cautiously encouraged by the announcement by the interim government that it has a potential plan for moving forward with a democratic process and elections, both parliamentary and presidential, and we think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 And we call on parties -- all parties to engage in a dialogue about that process and not to refuse to participate.\xc2\xa0 Because we believe, as I said earlier, that the best hope for resolving this crisis is through a process that is inclusive and in which everyone participates.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A quick note on another subject.\xc2\xa0 Today there is a memorial for the 19 firefighters killed in Arizona.\xc2\xa0 Vice President Biden is going there.\xc2\xa0 I wondered why the President, who has made a practice of going to some of these tragic remembrances before, chose not to go to this one.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\'s very meaningful for Vice President Biden to attend, as you may have heard him in the past speak about his own personal experiences with firefighters.\xc2\xa0 He has a very high regard -- as the President does -- but a personal experience that I think makes him a fitting representative of this administration, of the American people at the memorial.\xc2\xa0 He is traveling out there and will be joined by members of Congress I think from the delegation.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any concern about the President and his entourage, any disruption?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say in general we always look at that. But I think that this was about the appropriateness of having Vice President Biden attend.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Syria, the President has said he will give more military aid to Syria, but intelligence committees in Congress seem to be holding up that plan.\xc2\xa0 And I\'m just wondering if you can explain from the White House perspective why this is happening.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why aid is not flowing to Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have consistently stepped up our assistance to the Syrian opposition and we are engaged with Congress in discussions about that policy and why we believe it\'s the correct policy.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to Congress and relevant committees for actions they\'re taking or not taking.\xc2\xa0 But it\'s the President\'s belief that we need to, as we have, continue to step up our assistance to the Syrian opposition, as well as the Supreme Military Council, I believe it\'s called.\xc2\xa0 And we\'re going to continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President waiting for a signal from Congress that it\'s okay to send the new military aid that has been spoken of?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that we\'re going to work with Congress, as the President noted when he announced the expansion of our assistance to the Supreme Military Council -- the President said that we would consult with Congress, and that\'s what we\'re doing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Syria?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll get to you in a minute.\xc2\xa0 Let me get to the folks -- anything else?<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wanted to also ask about the disaster in Quebec. What\'s the White House response or reaction to that disaster?\xc2\xa0 And, more broadly, is the White House taking leadership or looking at the safety issues involved in the vast expansion in shipping oil by rail?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'re obviously aware of and evaluating what happened in Quebec.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have an assessment to make about it related to the broader questions, but we\'re in consultation with the authorities about it.\xc2\xa0 But I\'ll have to take the question in terms of other specific responses.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to Egypt for a moment.\xc2\xa0 The timeframe for elections in six months -- can you comment -- you touched on it, but comment specifically?\xc2\xa0 Does that seem reasonable to the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we will not prescribe a timeline.\xc2\xa0 We are cautiously encouraged by the announcement of a plan that includes a return to democratically elected government; that includes parliamentary and presidential elections.\xc2\xa0 And also, as I understand it, this preliminary plan calls for a referendum on constitutional amendments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this is a positive sign.\xc2\xa0 There is obviously a lot that has to happen for such a timeline to be implemented and we expect that this will be an evolving process.\xc2\xa0 Central to, in our view, the success of this kind of transition is the participation of and inclusion of all parties in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we call on all parties to participate in a dialogue, and we call on the Egyptian authorities to understand that they need to include all parties, that the success of this transition depends on the inclusion of all parties in the process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Switching topics to Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday a federal judge generally described the force-feeding going on there as inhumane and called on the President to intervene to stop it.\xc2\xa0 Is that something he would now consider doing?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, on the questions of litigation, I would refer you to the Department of Justice and the Defense Department, which obviously runs Guantanamo Bay -- I would refer you to them for specifics about the hunger strikers.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in April, we do not want these individuals to die. And he understands that this is a challenging situation, but for the specifics about the hunger strikers and then the litigation itself, I would refer you to the two agencies.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You know -- he knows it\xe2\x80\x99s quite unusual for a judge to make this kind of appeal to the President to directly intervene. And would the fact that a judge has done this in any way make him change his mind on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the President made clear in April and I think it holds true today that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want these individuals to die and the action being taken is to prevent that from happening.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking -- and you heard him discuss this recently in his speech at the National Defense University -- he believes that we need to close Guantanamo Bay.\xc2\xa0 He has long believed that. And he has returned to this issue because he believes that it\xe2\x80\x99s in our national security interest to do so.\xc2\xa0 And he calls on Congress to work with him to ensure that we can lift the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review those detainees on a case-by-case basis.\xc2\xa0 And then, where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and through our military justice system.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the long-term goal here has been, in keeping with the views of leading Republicans as well as Democrats, as well as military officials and other national security experts, we need to close this facility because it\xe2\x80\x99s in our interest to do so.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally on Snowden, has anyone in the administration been notified by Russian officials that Snowden plans to accept Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s offer of asylum?\xc2\xa0 And is the administration making it clear to Russia that it would hurt the diplomatic relationship between the two countries if they allow him to travel?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that was a tweet, and we have no further information regarding that.\xc2\xa0 Our general position is as I described it yesterday, which is that Mr. Snowden ought to be returned to the United States, where he is wanted on felony charges, and that although we do not have an extradition treaty with Russia, that there is ample legal justification for Russia to expel him, and that he should not be permitted to engage in further international travel beyond the travel necessary to return to the United States.</p>\n<p>And we\xe2\x80\x99ve communicated that position with our Russian counterparts and with every country, broadly speaking, that has been discussed as a possible either transition point or destination point for Mr. Snowden.</p>\n<p>Ann.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Afghanistan -- there are reports that the Taliban has closed at least for now its office in Doha.\xc2\xa0 Has the President had any success, or has he made any attempts to restart negotiations with President Karzai on any kind of follow-on force after the U.S. withdrawal?\xc2\xa0 And is there anything that is bringing the President closer to the thought that maybe the zero option with no follow-on force is the right course?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me address the first part, which is we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the reports about the Doha office, and as President Karzai and President Obama said, the surest way to a stable, unified Afghanistan is for Afghans to talk to Afghans and it is up to the Taliban to decide if they are serious about negotiations.</p>\n<p>Now, the President said, and I said and others have said, that we knew this would be a difficult process.\xc2\xa0 It has been a difficult process and will continue to be.\xc2\xa0 And if this effort, the Doha office effort does not succeed, we will pursue other means and other avenues for peace, because ultimately peace in Afghanistan depends on a reconciliation between Afghans.</p>\n<p>When it comes to a potential residual force in Afghanistan after 2014, we have long been clear that this is something that we will discuss and negotiate with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 Going all the way back to January, when my colleague discussed this with you, we have made clear that the options that are available include the zero option, the so-called zero option.\xc2\xa0 But the focus we have in these conversations with and negotiations with the Afghan government is on how do we implement our two policy objectives here beyond 2014, which is to continue to pursue the remnants of al Qaeda in the Afghan-Pakistan region, one; and two, how do we continue to train and equip Afghan security forces so that they can protect the stability and integrity of the Afghan government.</p>\n<p>So those are our policy objectives, and we will continue to work with the Afghan government as we look at the options available to us post-2014.</p>\n<p>Now, I want to make clear, today\xe2\x80\x99s story notwithstanding, that this is not a decision that\'s imminent and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a residual force -- a potential residual force in a year and a half.\xc2\xa0 So these are ongoing conversations.\xc2\xa0 They\'re part of a bilateral security agreement discussion that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with the Afghans.</p>\n<p>And separate and apart from time -- or separate but actually integral to this is our broader commitment to Afghanistan reflected in our strategic partnership agreement.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to be committed to Afghanistan beyond 2014 in our robust civilian assistance and our support for the Afghan National Security Forces.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How did the President\xe2\x80\x99s teleconference with President Karzai -- did it end badly, as has been reported?\xc2\xa0 And has there been any communication directly between them since then?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President speaks with President Karzai periodically, and we talk about at the presidential level and other levels all the issues that we have between us -- the U.S. government and the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 And there is great consensus between Afghanistan, the Afghan government and this administration, the U.S. government, about our view of the need for Afghanistan to be secure and sovereign and democratic in the future.</p>\n<p>Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had disagreements in the past, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll have them in the future, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 But the core agreement here is on a future in Afghanistan that is stable and democratic and secure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that teleconference is the last, most recent conversation between them?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\'t know -- I don\'t believe they\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken since.\xc2\xa0 But again, they speak with some frequency, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will have another conversation in the future.\xc2\xa0 I would not -- the article today I think, in the first instance, pointed to an option that we publicly said was available to us six months ago.\xc2\xa0 And the suggestion that a videoconference call was determinative about anything I think is incorrect.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, I have a couple on Egypt, but I just want to follow up on this.\xc2\xa0 Would you not say that the arrow was pointing more in the direction of the possibility and potential probability of the zero-troop option, if not just because of the down slope that things are and the status of conversations between the two governments, but you\xe2\x80\x99re not even talking about a bilateral security agreement?\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear without that, there\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be troops after 2014.\xc2\xa0 So is it the probability of that decision being made more likely now than it was six months ago when you acknowledged it was possible?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s the case.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly no more possible today than it was a week ago, prior to the article being published.\xc2\xa0 The option has always been available and it is part of a process that is focused not on troop numbers but on policy objectives, and how do we best do that.\xc2\xa0 And part of how we best do that is if we do decide to leave a residual force there in pursuit of these policy objectives, what kinds of agreements do we have with the Afghan government going forward with regards to that residual force.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the suggestion that we are somehow close to a determination or a conclusion in that negotiation is incorrect.\xc2\xa0 We are long -- there is no decision imminent and there need not be.\xc2\xa0 We are on a downward slope.\xc2\xa0 We are continuing to draw down our forces.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re roughly at 60,000, I believe, and the President publicly stated that he is committed to bringing that troop level down even further come early 2014.</p>\n<p>In the end, the residual force and whether there is one will depend on our negotiations with the Afghans and on our assessment of the best way to achieve our policy objectives as I laid out.\xc2\xa0 And this was the virtue and the clarity that was provided by the President\xe2\x80\x99s review of our Afghan policy back in 2009, which required, after many years adrift, intense focus on what our objectives would be and why we were there in the first place, and the recognition that we would not -- and this goes to the reconciliation process -- that we were not committed to a U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan simply for the sake of a U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We are there, our men and women are there, fighting and, in some cases, dying for clear objectives of U.S. national interests.\xc2\xa0 And they will continue to fulfill that mission.\xc2\xa0 And going forward after 2014, there will be very clear objectives for our policy in Afghanistan, and those objectives may be met by a residual force of U.S. troops in Afghanistan or they may be met through other means.\xc2\xa0 I mean, there are other ways to train and equip security forces and there are other ways, obviously, to continue our efforts against remnants of al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that the awkward launch of the peace talks -- I mean, Karzai denounced them the next day -- there\xe2\x80\x99s not a conversation currently going on at any productive level on a bilateral security agreement -- don\xe2\x80\x99t those two factors complicate this decision-making process and conversations about the entire issue --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If I allowed the predicate here and said yes, that would only be true if we had to make a decision tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no decision that\xe2\x80\x99s imminent.\xc2\xa0 And I have been -- and you have been an observer of and, in my case, now a participant in at least in an outer-circle way this process for some time now, and there have long been ups and downs in these conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99ve had.\xc2\xa0 And we have --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You want to downplay --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 I think that we can go back over time and look at assessments that say things are on a downward slope, to use your language, and then we continue to have our conversations and we continue to focus with our Afghan counterparts on our shared objectives, and we pursue those objectives together.\xc2\xa0 And we expect that we will be able to do that going forward.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Egypt, if I heard you correctly, you were at least encouraging the Muslim Brotherhood to reconsider their announced intention not to participate in this timeline.\xc2\xa0 What is your message to them, broadly speaking?\xc2\xa0 Because they might reasonably say, we did participate and things have been changed in an antidemocratic way after the will of the people was counted and deduced to be conducted fairly?\xc2\xa0 What incentive does the Muslim Brotherhood have for getting back into a process that they saw completely taken off track?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that goes to the incredible complexity and difficulty of this situation.\xc2\xa0 And it is why we expressed, and the President expressed his deep concern about the removal of President Morsi from office by the Egyptian armed forces.</p>\n<p>What we have to focus on is where do we go from here.\xc2\xa0 How do we return to a democratically elected civilian government?\xc2\xa0 And the best way to do that, and the best way to ensure that the return to a democratically elected government is not an end point but the beginning point of a process that has democracy becoming embedded in Egyptian society and in the state is to make sure that all elements of Egyptian society are participating in this process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And it\'s going to be hard, and it\'s going to be difficult. But the alternative is continued crisis and continued political polarization.\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to what individuals -- or which individuals will lead Egypt in the future, that\xe2\x80\x99s for the Egyptian people to decide.\xc2\xa0 And it\'s for the Egyptian people to decide in a democratic process.</p>\n<p>And as I said yesterday and I\'ll say again today, when it comes to what happened in Egypt, it is important to note that millions and millions of Egyptians were extremely unhappy with the undemocratic governance under President Morsi.\xc2\xa0 And what the President has long said -- as it applies to Egypt and as it applies elsewhere around the world -- democracy is not elections alone.\xc2\xa0 A successful election, a free and fair election with a result is not the endpoint to democracy.\xc2\xa0 It is an ongoing, organic process that involves participation by everybody in the political process, and compromise -- constant compromise between parties and groups with differing objectives.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we call on the Egyptian people and all the groups involved here to recognize and accept, and that is reconciliation over conflict; peaceful dialogue over violent confrontation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to talk -- one more thing about the aid question.\xc2\xa0 I understand this is complex and difficult, but the law is the law.\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m curious about is why the administration won\'t just say the law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply because it\'s not a coup, and we\'re going to go forward with our own strategic objectives.\xc2\xa0 Because there\'s a certain element of what you\'re saying that sounds like it\'s a difficult law, it\'s very complicated to live up to it, and that sounds like you\'re sort of creating a space for you to not adhere to the law when the law, as many members of Congress -- very senior, very experienced -- say is absolutely clear on this particular subject.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And what I\'m saying is that in the process of making a determination and making a designation, we will take the time necessary that will allow us to pursue our policy objectives --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s clear you don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a coup.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that are in the interest of the United States and of the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s clear this administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it was a coup.\xc2\xa0 Why not just make an authoritative assessment and move on?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think what I\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear is that the designation carries with it very significant consequences, and that we have policy objectives here when it comes to the return to a democratic government in Egypt and hopefully a return to some stability in Egypt that remains our number-one objective, and that we will take the time necessary, as we review our legal obligations and as we consult with Congress, when it comes to this issue of designating and labeling the events that took place, because we believe that\xe2\x80\x99s in the best interests of the United States.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, if I heard you correctly yesterday, you suggested that you\xe2\x80\x99d have more time to make this assessment if the Egyptian military was able to keep things cool and there not be an explosion of violence.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your understanding of what happened yesterday, when 50-plus people were killed?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we condemn and are deeply disturbed by all violence across Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we call on the military to exercise maximum restraint, and we call on protesters to protest peacefully and to not engage in or incite violence.\xc2\xa0 We call on all groups to call on their supporters to engage in this process peacefully and not to resort to violence.\xc2\xa0 And we call on those groups not to incite violence.</p>\n<p>A path of violence and conflict on the streets of Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt is not a path that will lead to a resolution of this crisis anytime soon.\xc2\xa0 And we, again, are cautiously encouraged by the preliminary plan that was put forward by the interim authorities, and we encourage all parties to participate in dialogue and reconciliation rather than conflict, and to resist decisions that would exclude them from the process going forward.\xc2\xa0 Because the best chance for resolving this crisis, the best chance for a return to a democratically elected government and for eventual prosperity and peaceful democratic transition in Egypt is reconciliation and dialogue and negotiation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you accept the military\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that its troops were attacked?\xc2\xa0 Do you accept Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s supporters claim that they were shot at while they were in the midst of prayers?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an assessment to make specifically of what happened and who was responsible for the terrible violence.\xc2\xa0 What we know is that there was not enough restraint; there was violence that resulted in death.\xc2\xa0 And that is not helpful to a process that needs to move towards peaceful reconciliation and transition.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The issue of U.S. aid, does the United Arab Emirates and now, apparently, Saudi offers of aid to Egypt mitigate what may be the U.S. need to cut aid?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as I said earlier, the issue of our assistance to Egypt encompasses more than the dollar figure involved.\xc2\xa0 This is a longstanding partnership, a longstanding commitment to the nation of Egypt and to the Egyptian people by the United States, by both major parties in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And we need to keep that in mind as we make decisions going forward about our assistance programs and about the designations we make that could affect those assistance programs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>It is our view that we should not change those assistance programs abruptly or immediately.\xc2\xa0 We need to take our time to evaluate the situation, to evaluate the implications of any designation we might make, to consult with Congress, to review our obligations under the law, and to be mindful throughout this of what our policy objectives are and what actions we can take to help us achieve those policy objectives.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I boil that down by saying we need to continue to have influence with the Egyptian military and cutting aid would impair that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that that question, at least the underlying point behind it, kind of contradicts the underlying point of the question you asked initially about aid from other countries.\xc2\xa0 If it were just about the dollar figure, then it would be less relevant.\xc2\xa0 It is apparently, based on the reports that you cited, it\xe2\x80\x99s about more than that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about a commitment to the Egyptian people and about the best way we can achieve our objectives in Egypt and the region.</p>\n<p>Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the status of President Morsi?\xc2\xa0 Is he still under house arrest?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you guys know?\xc2\xa0 Have you guys talked to him?\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve reached out to the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood.\xc2\xa0 What do you guys know?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not aware of any conversations that our government has held with him, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in public about his status.\xc2\xa0 We have made clear that we are urging the authorities to resist arbitrary arrests and to release those who --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you believe he is under house arrest?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I have no reason not to believe that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information that goes beyond the public reports.\xc2\xa0 We are engaged with Egyptian authorities at various levels.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Hagel has been engaging; Secretary Kerry; and then obviously the Ambassador and others.\xc2\xa0 The President, as I said, will be having conversations with leaders in the region about Egypt.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any additional information about President Morsi beyond what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in public.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is his incarceration the trigger for whether you guys identify this as a coup or not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to be blunt here about how we\xe2\x80\x99re going through this deliberative process and the policy objectives we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve.\xc2\xa0 The fact is we oppose any arbitrary arrests and we urge the authorities to resist doing that and to release those who might have been arrested or have been arrested arbitrarily.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to take our time, the time necessary to assess the situation and make a decision regarding the designation.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a point -- I mean, does the decision about whether or not to take a second look about aid become a different situation if they don\xe2\x80\x99t release him?\xc2\xa0 Is there a timeline that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to link these issues to if X happens, Y happens.\xc2\xa0 I would simply say that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are they not linked?\xc2\xa0 They are -- they\xe2\x80\x99re related, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think there are a number of issues that are linked here to our assessment of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Egypt and the progress that we hope to see towards a transition back to a democratically elected government, and that includes obviously addressing the constitution.\xc2\xa0 It includes parliamentary and presidential elections.\xc2\xa0 And importantly, it will necessarily include participation by all parties so that the process produces a result that is durable and has a better chance for long-term stability in Egypt and, therefore, for fostering economic and -- positive economic growth in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the United States government involved in the negotiation of Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s release, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any information on that, and certainly not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I think we are in conversations with -- I know that we are in conversations with the Egyptian authorities about all of the issues that I just discussed.\xc2\xa0 And that would include steps forward.\xc2\xa0 It would include resisting the use of the force.\xc2\xa0 It would include our opposition to arbitrary arrest.\xc2\xa0 So within that category, I would say the answer is yes. But I don\'t have anything specific about any individual.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if they\xe2\x80\x99ve got him under arrest, there\xe2\x80\x99s been arbitrary violence, I mean all these things you have laid out, they\xe2\x80\x99ve not taken the advice of the United States government on this.\xc2\xa0 So at what point -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve laid out all these criteria, and yet it doesn\'t appear -- at least according to our reporters on the ground --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And which is why we are disturbed by all the violence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.\xc2\xa0 Now, we hope that violence abates, and we hope that there is progress towards reconciliation and progress towards a return to a democratically elected civilian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And this is an early stage in the process, so I want to emphasize the \xe2\x80\x9ccautiously\xe2\x80\x9d part of saying that we\xe2\x80\x99re cautiously encouraged by the preliminary plan that was announced.\xc2\xa0 But that is -- the plan as it\xe2\x80\x99s been presented reflects what we believe is the path that Egypt needs to take.\xc2\xa0 But it also -- in order to take that path successfully, we think it has to include everyone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a position -- does the administration have a position on the Manchin-Lamar Alexander-Angus King bipartisan student loan compromise bill in the Senate?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, is for a long-term fix here, but we are generally for a resolution of this problem because we have already passed the deadline whereby students face a doubling of their loan rates.\xc2\xa0 And there is no reason why, in our view, this cannot be worked out by the Senate and the House.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of this compromise?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to -- I don\'t have a specific -- we\xe2\x80\x99re supportive of a process that leads to a compromise and a resolution here, one that does not -- that ensures that rates are kept low for students, that does not try to reduce the deficit on the backs of students by jacking up their rates, and that ensures that middle-class families are able to pay the cost of college and that those who aspire to the middle class have a chance at paying for college.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand -- but no position on it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific position on a piece of legislation beyond the assertion that there is a path here towards compromise that achieves the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles, and we urge members of both houses and of both parties to reach that compromise because the clock is ticking.</p>\n<p>We are confident that we can reach -- that a compromise can be found that will be retroactive and therefore not cause harm to students and their families.\xc2\xa0 But the fact is that students are\xc2\xa0 -- the longer we wait, students will be, and their families will be, planning for the fall and the future, and have to make decisions based on what they believe will be their rates.\xc2\xa0 But I --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Could you support it or not support it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support a process that -- supporting a single bill is not the answer here.\xc2\xa0 Supporting a compromise that can get the votes necessary that meets the President\xe2\x80\x99s principles is our position.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s U.N. Ambassador talked today about evidence that he says his government has given the U.N. about chemical weapons used by the Syrian rebels.\xc2\xa0 Has the U.S. changed its position that that\xe2\x80\x99s --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 We have yet to see any evidence that backs up the assertion that anybody besides the Syrian government has had the ability to use chemical weapons or has used chemical weapons.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting point that this assertion has been made to or presented to the United Nations because there is the sticking point.\xc2\xa0 Bashar al-Assad called for a U.N. investigation into the use of chemical weapons and then he blocked the ability of the United Nations to conduct that investigation.\xc2\xa0 The way to answer this question is to allow the United Nations to investigate, because our ability as an international community to investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria is hampered by Assad\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to allow a United Nations investigation.</p>\n<p>Now, we have been able to do the work that we\xe2\x80\x99ve done, both on our own and working with our partners and working with the Syrian opposition, but if Bashar al-Assad is seriously interested in proving his assertion and now the assertion that Russia is making, they should allow -- Assad should let the U.N. investigators in and Russia should use its relationship with Assad to press Assad to allow the United Nations investigators in.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So when you say you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen any evidence, have you seen what the Russians have provided the U.N. --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question, but we seriously doubt that chemical weapons have been outside of the use and -- have fallen outside of the sort of sphere of control of the Syrian government.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Mark.\xc2\xa0 I mean Peter, sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the health care reform law, what\'s the response here to the letter and the statement that the House GOP leaders made today calling on the President to justify delaying the employer mandate while keeping the individual requirements in place?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A few things.\xc2\xa0 The Affordable Care Act, Obamacare -- well, let me start for this -- we, as I said yesterday, have delayed the implementation of the employer responsibility provision to allow for the time that businesses said they needed to prepare properly for the implementation of that provision.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, this is a provision that affects only 4 percent of businesses, roughly, with more than 50 employees -- 96 percent of businesses with more than 50 employees already provide insurance to their employees.\xc2\xa0 So there\'s that.\xc2\xa0 The experts have already said this will have no significant impact on implementation of the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we will go forward with the individual responsibility provision because Obamacare provides financial assistance through this provision to low-income Americans, and it provides built-in flexibility to ensure that those who cannot afford coverage are not punished.\xc2\xa0 In fact, next year, millions of Americans will get the help they need to purchase quality health insurance that they currently cannot afford.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it\'s pretty rich, coming from leaders who have now voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act going on 40 times and who promised to do it again, to charge up that hill only, again, not to reach the top, rather than focus on the work that the American people want done, because they have no alternative.\xc2\xa0 Repealing the Affordable Care Act means taking away from senior citizens the assistance that they already have to help them pay their prescription drug bills.\xc2\xa0 It means telling young Americans across the country who are 26 or younger who are currently on their parents\' insurance policy that they\'re uninsured.\xc2\xa0 It means telling people with preexisting conditions who now cannot be denied insurance that they\'re out of luck.\xc2\xa0 And it means telling people who used to worry about lifetime caps on the provision of insurance benefits but who no longer have to worry about that because of the Affordable Care Act that they\'re out of luck.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s the alternative that Speaker Boehner is talking about, because there is no alternative put forward by House Republicans.\xc2\xa0 Even the hint of a possibility that Majority Leader Cantor might actually try to come up with some Republican alternative for health care reform was eviscerated by the conservative elements and the tea party elements in the Republican Party who pressured the Speaker of the House to kill it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the Republican alternative is repeal and replace with what?\xc2\xa0 A system where the insurance companies got to tell you whether you could keep your insurance, they could throw you off when they wanted to, and when millions of Americans who because of the Affordable Care Act will have access to insurance that they otherwise could not afford would still not have insurance.</p>\n<p>So implementation is moving forward.\xc2\xa0 And the benefits that more and more Americans will gain from that implementation I think will make clear that the absence of an alternative put forward by House Republicans in particular is not an alternative at all.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, to what extent might you or the people involved in this issue here, policy people, be concerned that the public\'s confidence, belief in this law has been shaken by this change, by the word of the change in the smoking provision and some of the other adjustments, major and minor, that have come along?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A piece of legislation like this, to be responsibly implemented, needs to be implemented in a flexible way.\xc2\xa0 We have demonstrated our flexibility in implementation of this law repeatedly.</p>\n<p>When it comes to giving states more flexibility in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we\'ve made clear to states that we want them to use that flexibility.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to listening to businesses who have concerns about the timeline and the deadline for implementing the employer responsibility provision, we listen to those concerns and we\'ve delayed that deadline because we think it\'s the right thing to do and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to punish those employers -- the overwhelming percentage of employers who have more than 50 employees who provide insurance by implementing it before those businesses who want to do the right thing and provide insurance are ready to implement -- for the implementation of that provision.</p>\n<p>So I think that our flexibility here and our adaptation to the needs and concerns of different communities -- whether it\'s business or statehouses -- reflects the fact that we\'re interested in doing this right so that all the benefits that are available to the American people become available in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p>Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to Egypt.\xc2\xa0 Needless to say, the U.S. is not the only player on the world stage here.\xc2\xa0 You mentioned that the U.S. has been in touch with the players in Egypt with -- having discussions and recommendations.\xc2\xa0 But there are European allies, U.S.-European allies who have had long-term relationships with Egypt going back hundreds of years.\xc2\xa0 How closely has the United States -- and what is their mindset and this administration\xe2\x80\x99s mindset of involving those people, those individuals in Europe, especially Great Britain, et cetera, who have a real stake in the region, as well as the United States, in terms of moving on to the future?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, when it comes to the transition and turmoil that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the Middle East overall, we have obviously and consistently worked with and consulted with our European allies, as well as our regional allies and others, and that includes the UK and France and others.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to do that when it comes to the situation in Egypt, as, of course, we do when it comes to the situation in Syria.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely right that this is not just a U.S.-Egyptian situation.\xc2\xa0 This is a crisis in Egypt that all of the nations who have an interest in Egypt having a better future and the Egyptian people making a transition to democracy need to engage in.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re engaged with our allies in this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything specific --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any readouts of conversations, but these are the kinds of sort of top-tier issues that we work with our allies all the time on.</p>\n<p>Cheryl, and then Roger, and then --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Do you have any update or timeline on when the Attorney General might finish his review of federal benefits and laws in light of the Supreme Court DOMA decision?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to the Department of Justice.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Who else?\xc2\xa0 Roger, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, back to Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 You said there was no imminent decision on the troop pull-out and stuff like that.\xc2\xa0 How long can the President go into next year and make a decision and still achieve his goal by the end of 2014?\xc2\xa0 Can he go like into next summer -- make the decision?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, before I hazard a guess, I would say that we\xe2\x80\x99re 18 months from the end of 2014, so -- and we are in the process of drawing down our forces already, and that process will continue and will continue beyond January 2014 as we draw down our forces towards the goal of zero as we consider the option of a residual force, a much smaller than current level force.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think there\xe2\x80\x99s ample time.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to predict when that sort of becomes pressing, but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not in the near future.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He could put it into -- the decision, he could put it into next year sometime?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t -- I don\'t want to have an answer to that question result in a headline in Bloomberg saying, the President will announce early next year or sometime next year, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not hemming -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99m sort of circumscribing his -- the timeline here.\xc2\xa0 But I am saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s not imminent, and it doesn\'t need to be imminent.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s in discussions with his national security team, and obviously our representatives are in discussions with the Afghan government about a bilateral security agreement and about implementation of our strategic partnership agreement, and within the context of the BSA, the potential for a residual force.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And is it fair to say that the President is considering the zero option with a bit heavier weight now than he\xe2\x80\x99d been, say, a few months ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that, as I said to Major, is a misreading of the situation.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that we stated here -- I think it was here, but it was certainly publicly and in January -- that zero was an option.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It was a conference call.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A conference call made I think from this building.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But the point being that this has been -- it\xe2\x80\x99s of course an option, because the issue here isn\xe2\x80\x99t troops -- the number of troops for their own sake.\xc2\xa0 The issue is, how do we best, working with the Afghan government and working to provide the conditions necessary for a residual force, implement our policy objectives, which includes continuing to go after the remnants of al Qaeda and providing the training and equipment to the Afghan National Security Forces that the ANSF needs to protect and keep stable the Afghan government and the Afghan nation.</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re making assessments about how we fulfill those objectives.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re in discussions with the Afghan government about what a residual force might look like if we choose that option, if that\xe2\x80\x99s the best option that we agree to in terms of pursuing those objectives.\xc2\xa0 But we can pursue those objectives in a number of ways.</p>\n<p>Yes, in the back.\xc2\xa0 And then -- sorry, you know what, I did promise you.\xc2\xa0 Sorry.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 One on Syria and one on Turkey.\xc2\xa0 Quick on Syria -- according to the latest credible reports, Syrian opposition still have not received any kind of military aid from your government.\xc2\xa0 My question is, it has been six weeks now that the U.S. government accepted that the red line has been crossed and it has been months from the first time Defense Secretary mentioned that.\xc2\xa0 So my question is, unless your government was bluffing, what kind of game-changing step and when are you going to take it, or are you still determined to take the game-changing<br/>\n\t--</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as I said earlier, in keeping with the President\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of our stepped-up assistance to the Supreme Military Council, we are going to consult with Congress on these matters, and we intend to provide that stepped-up assistance.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any more details on that for you, but we were not bluffing.\xc2\xa0 The President was very serious, as I think he made clear.\xc2\xa0 And I think that -- well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just say that we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to consult with Congress on this matter because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Turkey, the protests are still going on, and just last night, there were dozens of people detained and arrested.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your comment on this?\xc2\xa0 And also, there were investigations in Turkey and you said that you had full confidence in the Turkish authorities according to police brutality on the protestors.\xc2\xa0 Do you have an update on how --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update.\xc2\xa0 I mean, we continue to obviously monitor the situation.\xc2\xa0 We have a very important and close relationship with our ally, Turkey, and we will -- our position hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed on those matters, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have an update.</p>\n<p>Yes, in the back.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, continuously calling for the return to democratic governance in Egypt, implying that there was indeed a departure from democratic governance, but when does the President believe that that departure from democracy happened?\xc2\xa0 Did it happen under President Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s policies or did it happen when the military suspended the constitution and removed President Morsi from power?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we made clear that the President and his representatives had expressed concern, and our view that -- of the need for President Morsi to govern democratically, and that there were concerns about that.\xc2\xa0 And those concerns were reflected obviously in the streets of Cairo by protestors and demonstrators.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So I think that when it comes to what I\'m saying about what we hope will come in the future is a return to a democratically elected civilian government that would then govern democratically.\xc2\xa0 Because it is important -- as I said earlier and the President has noted -- to be clear that democracy is not simply the holding of elections, it is democratic governance.\xc2\xa0 And democratic governance requires compromise and inclusion, and it requires decisions that don\'t always go down easy with every member of your coalition, whether it\'s in the United States or in the Middle East or Europe or Asia or Africa or elsewhere.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So that is something that we were focused on with the Morsi government and it is something that we continue to be focused on, because the process here is the key.\xc2\xa0 It is not about individuals or groups, it\'s about a democratic process that is as inclusive as possible and that reflects a consensus among the Egyptian people.</p>\n<p>Thanks all very much.</p>\n<p>END<br/>\n\t2:13 P.M.
