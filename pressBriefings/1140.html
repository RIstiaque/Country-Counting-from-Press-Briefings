EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for waiting.\xc2\xa0 We pushed the briefing back, obviously, to allow for the President\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with the Prime Minister of Israel to wrap up, for the pool spray.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any announcements, but I will begin with questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 I guess, coming out of this meeting, what a lot of us are wondering is what was actually accomplished between Obama and Netanyahu.\xc2\xa0 There was a lot of talk, a lot of rhetoric about the commitment to peace, but in terms of actual substance, particularly on the issue of borders, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem that they made any progress.\xc2\xa0 Can you point to any concrete areas where they made progress today?<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, I would note that the Prime Minister and the President met one-on-one for more than an hour and a half -- more than twice the time expected.\xc2\xa0 And I think that\'s an indication of just how productive and constructive this meeting was.\xc2\xa0 They then, after breaking for a bit, coming back in for the pool spray and the statements, they went into a one-on-one lunch with the two of them -- just the two of them -- in the President\xe2\x80\x99s private dining room off the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think it was a very productive meeting and a lot was accomplished.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to talk about -- dramatic change in the Middle East and North Africa, the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech yesterday, and all the issues that both the President and the Prime Minister discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And so we feel it was a very useful and productive meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on the issue of borders, I know the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t specifically bring this up in the pool spray, but Prime Minister Netanyahu did.\xc2\xa0 He said that going back to the \xe2\x80\x9967 borders is indefensible.\xc2\xa0 How does that square off with what the President said yesterday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President said yesterday was quite clear.\xc2\xa0 The President said the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states.\xc2\xa0 That is a formulation that has been understood by parties to these negotiations and by anybody who\xe2\x80\x99s been a close observer of these negotiations in this region for years.\xc2\xa0 He felt it was important to articulate that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The security issue here is recognized by the President, was recognized clearly by the President in his speech yesterday and again today in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that every state has a right to self-defense, that Israel must be able to defend itself by itself against any threat.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that security provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think that, again, anybody who knows this issue knows that this has been an understood starting point for resolving one of the four major issues between these two peoples, which is territory, for a long time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I guess the question is then what is happening today on the U.S. side --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Do you mean, did they resolve the Arab-Israeli -- I mean, the Palestinian-Israel negotiations today?\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there progress being made to get the Israeli side to move closer to the U.S. position on the border issue?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, again, there is nothing that the President said yesterday that contradicts the 2004 letters that were exchanged between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon, or what Prime Minister Netanyahu said today in the Oval Office.\xc2\xa0 We -- the President said in his speech that a starting point for resolving the territorial issue is the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps and security for both nations.\xc2\xa0 I think that\'s -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in that statement and the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech yesterday that is contradicted by what the Prime Minister said.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why is he so mad?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that I accept that he was mad.\xc2\xa0 I think they had an excellent meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He said it\xe2\x80\x99s indefensible.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, he said the borders -- first of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand -- I mean, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to parse words from the President or the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 He said the borders were indefensible.\xc2\xa0 That\'s an issue about security --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He does not appreciate how the President framed it yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He was very clear about that on a plane on the way over and in the Oval Office.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, I think the President -- I think the Prime Minister made very clear, and the President did, that they don\'t agree on every issue but they are both committed to working together in the days, months ahead towards a peace, a two-state solution that allows for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, which the United States remains committed to profoundly.\xc2\xa0 I mean, this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is unshakeable and its demonstration of that goes beyond rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I stood with the Prime Minister Netanyahu and with the Vice President, when I worked for Vice President Biden, in Jerusalem when the Prime Minister made clear that this administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security is as great or greater than any administration in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xc2\xa0 And that is -- and the President feels very strongly about that.\xc2\xa0 He also feels very strongly that we need to take constructive steps towards peace.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, Jake -- sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to ask a non-Israel question.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Fine.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The IMF.\xc2\xa0 We see Secretary Geithner\xe2\x80\x99s comments about that today.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us if the Europeans are already floating a candidate?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on candidates or personnel and would refer you to whatever statement the Secretary of the Treasury might have made.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Would that go for pretty much any IMF question?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s about the next head of the IMF, probably.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Let me switch to another thing then.\xc2\xa0 Will Vice President Biden be holding talks next week with the deficit team?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The Vice President will be resuming talks next week.\xc2\xa0 I believe we have something on the books for Tuesday.\xc2\xa0 And he looks forward to those negotiations continuing.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ve been constructive and productive so far, and we hope that continues to be the case.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And with the latest developments with the Gang of Six, does the White House view this group as really the only group that has any hope of coming up with a deal that is credible?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this is -- these are negotiations led by the Vice President at the President\xe2\x80\x99s request with designated leaders of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Any deal has to be a deal between the House, the Senate, the Democrats, the Republicans, and the White House.\xc2\xa0 And the inputs are varied, but we do believe that -- and come from different places -- ideas come from different places, including the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission, the so-called Simpson-Bowles commission, including -- obviously the President put forth a very substantial vision and plan, and there have been many other significant and valuable contributions to the general idea of how we should move this forward -- get significant deficit reduction in order to promote economic growth and job creation in this country and get our fiscal house in order.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think that, yes, the Biden talks, the Vice President\xe2\x80\x99s talks are an important vehicle.\xc2\xa0 We believe that is the vehicle and will be the vehicle for an agreement.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re optimistic about that.\xc2\xa0 But obviously there have been a lot of important contributions from others not actually in the room.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Officials with the Israeli government say that obviously this -- negotiating the borders, the starting off point is the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines with swaps, but what they\xe2\x80\x99re upset about is that that was something that was going to be negotiated at the negotiating table, that they thought they could exact concessions from the Palestinians in exchange for which.\xc2\xa0 And now, for the first time, it\xe2\x80\x99s stated U.S. policy, which it has never been before.\xc2\xa0 It is the U.S. position now that the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines with swaps are the basis for that, not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that would be negotiated between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But this is a starting point for a negotiation on one element here, which is territory.\xc2\xa0 The President believes that progress can be made on territory and security, two of the four major issues that need to be resolved for a comprehensive peace.\xc2\xa0 And articulating a position and a truth is not -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not some radical new departure from where we have been and where the parties have been in these conversations and negotiations that have gone on for many years now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It might not be radical, but it\xe2\x80\x99s significant that that is now the stated U.S. position.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that it is important to speak truths that have -- that are evident to all the parties as a way of trying to help move these talks forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it is offering the Palestinians -- at a time that they are reconciling with an organization that the United States government considers to be a terrorist organization, it is offering the Palestinians a carrot in exchange for coming to the negotiating table.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no carrot here, and let me make sure -- make clear again what the President said.\xc2\xa0 First of all, this is a starting point, the basis for the eventual borders, 1967 lines, with mutually agreed swaps.\xc2\xa0 Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s the product of negotiations -- mutually agreed swaps.\xc2\xa0 All the determinations about security, products -- those determinations are the products of direct negotiation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So this is not an end point on the territory issue; this is an important starting point and a recognition of what all sides agree, as you just said, has to be the starting point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Secondly, on the question -- when this was -- the President could not have been clearer on the fact that Palestinian efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure.\xc2\xa0 Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September will not create an independent state.\xc2\xa0 And Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists -- continues to insist on a path of terror and rejection.\xc2\xa0 The President was clear about that yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s clear about that today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Netanyahu, in his discourse in the Oval Office, seemed to give the President some background information about the refugee issue, and stated that there were as many Jewish refugees after 1948 as there were Palestinian ones.\xc2\xa0 They were absorbed by Israel; the Palestinian ones have not been absorbed by Arab countries.\xc2\xa0 And this is one of the other issues that Netanyahu was upset about, is that he thought that President Obama took a step back from the official position.\xc2\xa0 In 2004, the letter you referred to from Bush to Sharon, stated that basically the Palestinians had took the right of return off the table and stated that Palestinians should be absorbed by this new Palestinian state.\xc2\xa0 And President Obama --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, you heard very clearly -- go ahead, I\'m sorry.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 President Obama said it was an issue to be resolved.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s a part of these negotiations -- and again, observers of these -- this process over many administrations, both here and in Israel, and even several leaderships of the Palestinian people, know what the four issues that need to be resolved are:\xc2\xa0 territory, security, refugees and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jerusalem, thank you.\xc2\xa0 So these -- and what the President said very clearly yesterday -- appreciate the help -- what the President said very clearly yesterday is that he believes we can move forward on territory and security in order to gain some momentum in this process that has been stalled and which needs to move forward during this moment of opportunity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But why back away from the Bush position?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, he addressed issues of territory and security yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I take issue that he moved in any direction on the issue that you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing.\xc2\xa0 What he talked about yesterday was territory and security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What seems to have the Israelis upset is that they perceive that he\xe2\x80\x99s pulled back from the position expressed by George W. Bush to Sharon in 2004.\xc2\xa0 As you know, words matter, nuance is important.\xc2\xa0 And in 2004, there was an expectation that they would go back to the \xe2\x80\x9867 lines, with -- taking into account the realities on the ground, I believe, which seemed to include the settlements in a way that mutually agreed swaps does not.\xc2\xa0 That and the refugee thing seem to be a backing away.\xc2\xa0 Why are they not?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, but look.\xc2\xa0 You can perceive or misinterpret what the President said, or you can look at what he said very precisely, okay?\xc2\xa0 There was actually an article by the Associated Press --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that\xe2\x80\x99s what they disagree --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- that wildly mischaracterized what the President said right off of his speech yesterday -- not by you.\xc2\xa0 But the President could not have been clearer.\xc2\xa0 The formulation of borders of Israel and Palestine being based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps -- that is a formulation that everybody understands who knows anything about this process.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same one that they thought they had in 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I do not want to negotiate the particulars here.\xc2\xa0 What the President said is not -- should not and is not considered new in terms of a starting point for the negotiations on the territorial boundaries.\xc2\xa0 It is a position that people have accepted to be true for a long time -- all parties.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s accepted it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All sides here have accepted it.\xc2\xa0 Well, Bill, maybe you haven\xe2\x80\x99t followed it that closely, but you know that -- the people who know it and follow this know it to be true.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying.\xc2\xa0 They don\xe2\x80\x99t accept it because they would like to reaffirm the language --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, there is nothing --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in the 2004 letter between President Bush and Prime Minister Sharon.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the realities on the ground.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On mutually agreed swaps, you can -- is that not -- I mean, that is pretty clear.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about mutually agreed swaps to resolve territorial and boundary issues.\xc2\xa0 That is very clear, Bill, and people understand what that means who know anything about these negotiations.\xc2\xa0 And that has been true for a long time.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you anticipate this reaction from the Israelis?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, again, I think we just heard from the Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the United States in the Oval Office, that they had a very constructive and useful conversation, an expression by the President on the fact that they have met seven times, and noted the significance of the relationship which was symbolized by the Prime Minister speaking to Congress, and the incredible commitment that this administration and this country has had and continues to have to Israel and to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that there are some disagreements, as I think the Prime Minister said, here and there -- you know, friends, obviously, can disagree on issues, and they should always be able to speak candidly to one another.\xc2\xa0 And I think that was the case in the President\xe2\x80\x99s speech, is the case in the conversation, the long conversation he had with the Prime Minister today, and it was the case and is the case in the way that the President spoke to all parties in this particular process in his speech yesterday, and also to all peoples and countries in the region in his broader speech, which I remind you was about not just the Middle East peace process but all of the historic change that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering if there was a candid conversation before the speech where somebody from the U.S. side said, here\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to lay out, and the Israeli sides may have said, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to push back hard if that\'s what he says.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We obviously notified and have constant consultations with our partners, including the Israelis, and consulted with the Israelis prior to the speech.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Libya, War Powers Act.\xc2\xa0 Is there movement on that, from your perspective?\xc2\xa0 Will there be consultation with Congress?\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99re at a deadline on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know, Mike, the President has been in consultation with Congress on Libya from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s actions have been and are consistent with the War Powers Resolution.\xc2\xa0 We have said from the beginning that we would welcome an expression of support from Congress, in this case similar to the one that has been put forward -- bipartisan one put forward by Senators McCain and Kerry and others.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we have consulted with Congress.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to consult with Congress, and would welcome support.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there a feeling, though, that he needs to ask authorization for continued operation --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would just say that we have -- the President has acted in a way that\'s been consistent with the War Powers Resolution, and would welcome an expression of support by Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you have a legal justification that you can share with us to sort of -- that you guys have sought on this, just to make sure --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 As you know --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not a lawyer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not a lawyer</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But can you share something --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is a -- there has been a long debate about -- in this country about -- and which we do not need to replicate here because the amount -- the stuff written about the War Powers Resolution over the years could fill this room and none of it would be conclusive.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We believe the President has acted in a way that\'s consistent with the War Powers Resolution, and has consulted -- he believes that consultation with Congress in matters like these is vital, and that\'s why he has consulted so regularly with Congress and will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 And he would welcome the support from Congress of the kind put forward in that resolution that I mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President appreciate or need the history lesson from Prime Minister Netanyahu?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the President appreciates the conversation he had with the Prime Minister, and obviously, the Prime Minister as the leader of Israel, and not for the first time, has a keen sense of his own country\xe2\x80\x99s history and was happy to hear what the Prime Minister had to say.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going to -- was there a specific conversation had about Jerusalem that didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in the -- it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up in the press spray.\xc2\xa0 Can you comment on that a little bit?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'m not going to -- it was a one-on-one conversation.\xc2\xa0 Obviously the President --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You say one-on-one, no aides --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- on either side?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Correct.\xc2\xa0 And for 95 minutes -- 96.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How long was the lunch?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Pretty brief, because the President had to go to Langley.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that was one-on-one --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That was one-on-one as well -- except, you know, somebody came in and probably brought them some food.\xc2\xa0 But -- and again, I think that is indicative of a solid relationship in the fact that they are able to speak very candidly back and forth and work very constructively together.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So, in terms of the content, obviously the President read out to his advisors the content of the discussion, but I\'m not going to get into details about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There was supposed to be, obviously, this working lunch where I think a one-plus-ten, I think it was.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Right.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is that getting rescheduled?\xc2\xa0 Is that still --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to do it because --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Today, I understand that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- because it went on for so long.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- you know, later today --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- for Shabbat -- or maybe after Saturday night.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, I think our schedule is packed, and the decision was made that it was better to do the one-on-one.\xc2\xa0 They were having constructive conversations.\xc2\xa0 It ran long.\xc2\xa0 And then rather than have a sort of ceremonial almost lunch with a bunch of people in one room, why not just then go back and the two of them keep talking?\xc2\xa0 So that was -- I think folks from either team who missed out on lunch will go a little hungry this afternoon, but it was for a greater cause.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Finally, can you preview the AIPAC remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that for you, except to say that you can expect the President to echo the themes from his speech yesterday, in particular the commitment to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security that this administration has and has had, and this country has and has had, and will go -- will have going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should anything be read into the fact the President did not bring up the 1967 -- that his statement about the 1967 borders --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in his comments today, knowing that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Nothing should be read into it, because he did give a long speech yesterday, and spoke quite comprehensibly -- comprehensively, as well as comprehensibly, on this issue yesterday, so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he needed to reiterate that for the pool spray.\xc2\xa0 They obviously talked about it in their one-on-one meeting.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he reiterate it on Sunday?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to preview the speech any more than I have.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys always want stuff in advance --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying -- I said he would echo the themes.\xc2\xa0 I just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure we have a -- I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we have that speech in hand yet, so I don\'t want to say one way or the other what\'s going to be in the speech before it\xe2\x80\x99s given.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can you just clear up what happened yesterday in terms of being late to the remarks?\xc2\xa0 All kinds of people are speculating that the President was on the phone with people or -- what was the real reason why he was late?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President was working on his speech and actually -- and then had a couple of other items not related to the speech that he had -- business he had to take care of, national security-related issues that were not related to the speech at all.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But was it like changing the \xe2\x80\x9967 --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Had nothing to do with reports -- I assure you, having seen every draft of the speech from the first one, that it had nothing to do -- no changes were made to that language during that time that led to the delay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just to clarify, so they only met one-on-one; there was never any staff in the room?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, staff -- staff came in.\xc2\xa0 Obviously there was some staff in there, for those who came in for the pool spray.\xc2\xa0 So there were -- but the meeting itself was one-on-one.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 For an hour and a half?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes, from 11:29 a.m. to 1:05 p.m.\xc2\xa0 Then they broke and the President met with his team and the Prime Minister, I believe, went and met with his team; came back, they had the pool spray; and then broke up briefly again and then came back and went to lunch, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when I left.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, but in the readout -- I know you say -- gave us a readout on content.\xc2\xa0 What did he say about the tone of those private discussions?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That they were productive and constructive and useful.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he mention any -- I mean, can you describe what the conversation -- characterize the conversation?\xc2\xa0 Did the Prime Minister bring up the 1967 borders, and what --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 They talked about all the issues related to the speech and related to the developments in the region.\xc2\xa0 Beyond that, I\'m not going to get into specific detail because the President moments ago spoke about their meeting, and I\'d rather leave it to him.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sorry, one more.\xc2\xa0 Can you just give us a sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s next on this topic, for the President, for members of the administration?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 On the Middle East peace process?\xc2\xa0 The President -- the administration wants and encourages both sides to return to direct negotiations.\xc2\xa0 He made clear that Palestinians have to answer some very legitimate and serious questions about how they move forward with negotiations, given the reconciliation agreement they had -- that the PA had with the -- with Hamas.\xc2\xa0 And so that obviously is something that needs to be resolved.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But he wants this process to move forward.\xc2\xa0 He thinks that this is an important window, and that, as he said yesterday, there are -- this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get easier as time goes on.\xc2\xa0 This will not get easier for the Palestinians or the Israelis.\xc2\xa0 It is in the interests of both parties to reach an agreement that can create a lasting peace and two-state solution.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jon-Christopher.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, since the President\xe2\x80\x99s historic address to Parliament on Wednesday is being characterized as the anchor speech of his trip to Europe, can you flesh out just a little bit what the President wants to accomplish in this address?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I will simply note that the speech will echo what he wants to accomplish in the trip, which is to reaffirm the importance of our relations with our European allies, in particular with the state visit to the U.K., the special relationship with the United Kingdom and the British people; talk about the cooperation we have on so many issues, including international economic issues, but also Afghanistan, Libya, in terms of foreign policy and so many others.\xc2\xa0 And -- so we have obviously the visit to Ireland, and he wants to -- obviously that will -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll get into that special -- that relationship that we have with Ireland and his personal history in Ireland, the fact that he has ancestors there, ancestry there; and then the U.K., and then obviously onto France for the G8.\xc2\xa0 He will focus -- he has asked, as you heard in the speech yesterday, that a focus of this discussion in part be about ways that we can work together enhance economic development in Egypt and Tunisia, and then on to Poland, a very important and close ally in Poland.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So he\xe2\x80\x99s very much looking forward to the trip.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have details for you beyond that on the speech to Parliament, although I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be expressing his gratitude to the British people for their involvement over the last few years in some of the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Oh, I think you can count on that, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the President spoken with Abbas, or did he -- since the speech, or did he speak with him ahead of the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\'ll have to take that.\xc2\xa0 I\'m not sure that he did.\xc2\xa0 Obviously we notified and consulted with the parties.\xc2\xa0 I\'m just not sure which individuals.\xc2\xa0 I\'m told he did not, but I\'m sure there were consultations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just wondering if he\xe2\x80\x99s going to, at some point in the near future, talk to Abbas about --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- Abbas had called the day before -- I mean, had said the day before in The New York Times that he was going to request to go to the U.N. in September and --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was it communicated --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- in terms of possible calls.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that the President was going to say that that is not the basis of a Palestinian --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve made that clear before, so I think they -- let me -- I can get details in terms of our outreach specifically related to the speech, a lot of which was done I think that morning.\xc2\xa0 But the -- but I can get details specifically on that.\xc2\xa0 But that position is something that we had stated before, that we do not believe that that\xe2\x80\x99s -- that that is not the path that will achieve a Palestinian state; that the only way to do that is through direct negotiations. *</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the consequence of Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 successful filibuster of Goodwin Liu?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Liu is highly qualified, has a keen intellect and mainstream views.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we regret that he was not confirmed and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the up or down -- just simple up and down vote that we would have liked.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re -- we made clear that that\xe2\x80\x99s what we wanted, and we regret that it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what happens now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In what sense?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In the larger sense of judicial nominations and confirmations, and also specifically --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work on other nominations.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s very important.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s obviously vital that open slots in our judiciary get filled, that open slots in our -- in this administration get filled.\xc2\xa0 And so we work regularly with Congress to make that happen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that mean you have to nominate different kinds of judges or consult some more in a different way?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We work with Congress on this; we continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 We believe that Goodwin Liu was a highly qualified candidate, that he should have been confirmed.\xc2\xa0 But we continue to work with Congress on other nominations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, can I follow on that?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Can I just -- let me work through Perry here, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to you.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why was Saudi Arabia not mentioned in the speech yesterday?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President mentioned a lot of countries.\xc2\xa0 You will note that the countries he did mention in the speech have either gone through democratic transformations -- Tunisia and Egypt -- or are currently experiencing the kinds of upheaval that have we -- that have been -- the kinds of -- that have been so historic in the past six months.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So I think if you note, those are the nations that he talked about in his speech with regard to the -- with regard to the region and the Arab Spring.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But doing neither, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get brought up?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It was a long speech, Chuck, and he spoke directly and in detail about a number of countries that are experiencing either positive transformation or are undergoing the kind of crackdown that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in Syria that we abhor and we\xe2\x80\x99ve condemned, and that we\xe2\x80\x99ve responded to with significant sanctions that we have ratcheted up as we continue to try to put pressure on the Syrian regime to cease the violence against its own people.\xc2\xa0 And he spoke very clearly about other countries -- Yemen and Bahrain and on and on.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear what he was doing with that speech.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So let me -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, you had -- you wanted to follow on the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the Liu nomination.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just wondering what happens with Liu now.\xc2\xa0 I mean, are you guys going to keep pushing for him?\xc2\xa0 Are you going to ramp up a campaign with Congress for him, or are you moving on?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think -- the Senate has voted.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know of any plan to continue to press on that, but why don\xe2\x80\x99t you check with my office and I\xe2\x80\x99ll see if I have anything else on that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The operative phrase in the 2004 letter is, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e. the 1967 borders.\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama concur with that line?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President did not say that Israel should withdraw or that its borders should be the 1967 lines.\xc2\xa0 He said that the border should be based on the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines with mutually agreed swaps --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just asking you if he concurs --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- and I made clear that there is nothing that --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- if there\xe2\x80\x99s no change, does he concur with that line --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing the President said that -- about these -- the boundaries and the issues of the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines that contradicts that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So he does concur with that line?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is nothing he said that contradicts it, Keith.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Quickly, one more line that was out of there.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cA solution to the Palestinian refugee issue, as part of any final status agreement, will need to be found through the establishment of a Palestinian state and a settling of the Palestinian refugees there, rather than in Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Does President Obama agree with that line in the 2004 letter?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, the President spoke very clearly and at length about this issue yesterday.\xc2\xa0 He spoke specifically about two of the major four issues that continue to frustrate this process, because they\xe2\x80\x99re difficult and they need resolution.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to characterize his position on issues that he had not discussed yesterday.\xc2\xa0 I would just point you to his speech yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You -- I just -- I mean, I\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned two things in that letter --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You could ask me --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why are you having so much trouble --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- you could ask me seven different things about what his position is.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 If there\xe2\x80\x99s no change in policy, why can\xe2\x80\x99t you just concur with the previous policy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 All I said was -- well, he gave -- he spoke at length about this, Keith, yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m a little bit confused by the notion that this is totally new to talk about the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines with land swaps.\xc2\xa0 I know that it\xe2\x80\x99s new that the President stated it.\xc2\xa0 But as far as I knew, this was already the position of the administration before.\xc2\xa0 The Secretary of State, several times, used the same language.\xc2\xa0 So is this a new position of the administration, or is it the old position of the administration just stated newly by the President?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve made pretty clear that this is a position that\xe2\x80\x99s been recognized by all parties to these negotiations for a long time -- that any territorial resolution would be based on the \xe2\x80\x9967 lines.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a position that was understood by all parties for a number of years now, including, obviously, the United States and this administration, but predating this administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Christi.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On that question, can you just walk us through it a little bit?\xc2\xa0 When did the President first start talking about actually stating the territory points?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the speech?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I mean, just like the idea of saying it himself and bringing it out into the open and moving it to a starting point.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to sort of give you a tick-tock of internal negotiations in terms of our policy positions and pronouncements that the President makes.\xc2\xa0 I mean, he made his speech.\xc2\xa0 It was a significant speech.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, can you say when he actually decided --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- that he would do so?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you know, or you just can\xe2\x80\x99t say?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wait --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just one, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- the question of the changes in the last half hour.\xc2\xa0 Can you characterize -- I mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty unusual for the President to deliver a speech late because he\xe2\x80\x99s making changes to it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR.

CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I covered a number of Presidents.\xc2\xa0 I would say that is not unusual.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It is for this President.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 It is the -- look, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get into any of the details.\xc2\xa0 I can -- but -- because there was a false report about what he -- where the edits were coming; they were not on the issue that we\xe2\x80\x99ve discussed.\xc2\xa0 There were also other issues that had nothing to do with his speech that intervened that made him a little late.\xc2\xa0 But, again, by the standard of presidencies I\xe2\x80\x99ve covered, this was not terribly late.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you a question about the speech?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Victoria.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How frustrated is the President that out of a 45-minute speech, here in the U.S. we\xe2\x80\x99re focused almost exclusively on pretty much one phrase, which is less than 10 seconds, which is \xe2\x80\x9c1967 borders,\xe2\x80\x9d and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking almost not at all about 44 minutes and 50 seconds that he spoke of.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m frustrated.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- no, I think obviously he knows that this is an important issue and we obviously had the Prime Minister of Israel visit the White House today, and the Prime Minister is staying for a number of days at the Blair House -- again, evidence of the significance of the relationship --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- was wasted, that the rest of it went into the ether --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Not at all.\xc2\xa0 Look, the President made some very important statements about U.S. policy toward a region that is going through historic transformation.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that speech was heard around the world, as well, importantly, in the region itself.\xc2\xa0 And he will -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will talk about his position on these issues again in the future.\xc2\xa0 But you are right to note that the speech was about much more than just the Middle East peace process.\xc2\xa0 And -- but he did put it within the context of a broader opportunity here, a window of opportunity, because of the historic changes we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lester.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Since the President believes that Israel should give back any land that it had won in battle, why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he believe that we, too, should give back land that we won in battle with Mexico?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Lester, I have gone over many times what the President said, and he certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just wondered why.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Connie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 Would the President accept militarized -- U.S. troops on the border if there is a border backing the 1967 lines?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a hypothetical way beyond where we are now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, sir.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 The Treasury Department statement says that the U.S. will support any candidate with broad support.\xc2\xa0 So will the U.S. support a candidate from an emerging market, say, from India, for the IMF chief post?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I confess that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent most of my time this morning on a different issue, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll let the Treasury Department statement stand.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And will the President be discussing this during the G8 meetings?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I imagine that the IMF will come up, but what that conversation will look like, I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But knowing the President\xe2\x80\x99s mind day to day, does he have a support for an emerging market --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You know, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me a question that I\xe2\x80\x99m just not going to answer.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, you said that the President wants the process to go forward.\xc2\xa0 What ideas does he have, considering that now that the Israelis are refusing the \xe2\x80\x9867 border and they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to negotiate with a government --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s this crazy mischaracterization of what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about here.\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t -- there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing the Prime Minister said that is inconsistent with what the President said yesterday, which was that the borders should -- borders should start from the basis of the \xe2\x80\x9867 lines, with mutually agreed swaps, okay?\xc2\xa0 Secondly, he had made very clear that any resolution of the territorial issue had to account for Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security, its ability to defend itself by itself, to prevent the infiltration of weapons and a resurgence of terrorism.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve answered the question about where we go from here.\xc2\xa0 Clearly the negotiations have to be between the Palestinians and the Israelis for this to succeed, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged the resumption of direct negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand that, but how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to bring them to the negotiating table, considering all the facts that we have seen today?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think that some issues need to be resolved, as the President made clear.\xc2\xa0 The Palestinians need to answer some questions about how they can credibly negotiate with Israel when -- given their reconciliation with Hamas, and Hamas has yet to renounce terrorism, renounce violence, or recognize the right of Israel to exist.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me go to Ron.\xc2\xa0 Let me to go Ron.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just want to follow up specifically on this issue of answering questions.\xc2\xa0 What exactly is the standard that the new Palestinian government has to meet to satisfy the President?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about weapons decommissioning?\xc2\xa0 Are we talking about leaders resigning or their government dissolving in order for the President to be satisfied that the Israelis should in fact engage with this Palestinian government?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ron, you\xe2\x80\x99re sort of getting ahead of the process.\xc2\xa0 The President --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning of the process because it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen -- Israel is not going to talk --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, then I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to negotiate the details of it.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear that it is unacceptable to us, Hamas\xe2\x80\x99s position, supporting terror, supporting violence, and refusing to recognize Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, exactly.\xc2\xa0 So does a mere -- not a \xe2\x80\x9cmere,\xe2\x80\x9d but does a statement suffice?\xc2\xa0 Does an extended period of no hostilities suffice?\xc2\xa0 What I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to understand is, what do they have to do to prove that, in fact --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me step back a little bit.\xc2\xa0 We are, again, a little ahead of ourselves, because we are still monitoring the developments related to this reconciliation, what it means in terms of Palestinian leadership.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to answer those questions specifically until we see what posture the Palestinians are going to take.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to draw any lines here when there are still a lot of unanswered questions.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stephen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask a question about the War Powers Act?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you saying that the Israelis are not --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I did already, while you were gone.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- properly or fully characterizing the President\xe2\x80\x99s position?\xc2\xa0 Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the Prime Minister talk about land swaps.\xc2\xa0 He just talked about the 1967 borders.\xc2\xa0 He seemed to be -- by that logic, he\xe2\x80\x99s reacting to something the President didn\xe2\x80\x99t say.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, what I -- the Prime Minister said -- spoke about the indefensibility of withdrawing to the \xe2\x80\x9867 borders was an issue of security, and the President made clear that, first of all -- made clear yesterday and certainly again today in his conversations, that what he said was that the borders would be based on the \xe2\x80\x9867 lines, should be based on the \xe2\x80\x9867 lines, with mutually agreed swaps, and that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security had to be paramount here, that it had to be able to defend itself, by itself, and all the other issues I laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So your observation is an interesting one, and I think the point that I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to make and others have tried to make is that there\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot stipulated about what the President said, and it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t included everything the President said yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Let me do the last one.\xc2\xa0 Let me go all the way in back.\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t hit the back row in a while.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 What several people seem to have hit on is that while the 1967 borders with land swaps is not new criteria for the negotiations, that the transparency with which a sitting President laid out for the world to see was new, and the transparency with which he laid out so many of the negotiating criteria that had previously been so esoteric in a lot of these negotiating procedures -- that is what\xe2\x80\x99s new.\xc2\xa0 So what then is the strategic advantage, according to the President, for laying this all out for the world to see?\xc2\xa0 I mean, there must be some reason --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Because he believes that it will help the process move forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, because I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important to speak truths that everybody understands, and that create a framework around which very tough negotiations can take place on the issue of territory.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the closure of the negotiation process and the criteria been part of the reason it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been successful yet?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, this has been a process that has -- that preceded this administration and has been a challenge to successive administrations, as well as leaders of the parties here.\xc2\xa0 And I think that the President is very interested in trying to find a way to move forward.\xc2\xa0 He understands that this is a hard issue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why it has been so hard to resolve.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what he -- the speech he gave yesterday, the section of the speech on this issue, was all about his desire to try to move the process forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I follow up on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s question about the War Powers Act?\xc2\xa0 Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how the U.S. is behaving in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s consistent with the War Powers Act.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I spoke at length about this when you were out of the room.\xc2\xa0 The President -- the President --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I just read the transcript -- you didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sixty days, expires today -- from congressional authorization, notification, 60 days expires today.\xc2\xa0 So how is this consistent?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President believes that he has acted and has acted consistent with the War Powers Resolution.\xc2\xa0 We can have a debate, which could spend the afternoon, and there\xe2\x80\x99s volumes and volumes written about the application and issues involving the War Powers Resolution.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that from here.\xc2\xa0 The President looks forward to, would welcome support from Congress on this issue, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say about it.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thank you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tEND 3:11 P.M.
