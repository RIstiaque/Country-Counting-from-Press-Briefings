EDT</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Welcome aboard Air Force One as we make our way to Charlotte, North Carolina.\xc2\xa0 So happy to have you.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 As I did yesterday, I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to tick through the speakers for the evening so you all have that fresh. So now you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the CEO of Carmax and the CEO of Costco. They\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about the need to not only unleash the power of our entrepreneurs and small businesses, but also invest in things that can help them succeed.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ll also hear from former employees of companies controlled by Romney\xe2\x80\x99s Bain Capital who will speak to the impact of his business experience on workers and families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tYou\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from Congressman Chris Van Hollen.\xc2\xa0 Elizabeth Warren will talk about what President Obama has done to make sure that Wall Street plays by the same rules as Main Street and what would happen if Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan had their way.\xc2\xa0 And finally, I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard this, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll from President Clinton this evening who will take the stage to talk about what the President has done to help the nation recover from the worst economic crisis ever handed to a new President and what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing to create an economy built to last.</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, one thing you won\xe2\x80\x99t hear is -- but you may have heard from the Romney-Ryan team today -- is a statement -- a comment by Paul Ryan that "the nation is in decline."\xc2\xa0 So what a pessimistic comment to come from the Republican ticket at a time when we\xe2\x80\x99re continuing to recover.\xc2\xa0 More work needs to be done, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear much more from the Democratic speakers tonight and tomorrow about what we need to do moving forward than that kind of pessimistic language.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I wanted to note if you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen it already that to help meet the growing humanitarian need caused by the violence in Syria, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah announced today in Jordan that the United States is providing an additional $21 million to the United Nations World Food Program.\xc2\xa0 With this new assistance the United States is providing a total of more than $100 million for humanitarian activities both inside Syria and in neighboring countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tNow, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did the President have any role in the decision to move his speech from the stadium to the arena?\xc2\xa0 And was he disappointed by the outcome there?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re all disappointed because we had 65,000 ticket holders, plus 19,000 people who were on the waiting list ready and excited and fired up to hear the President deliver his speech tomorrow night.\xc2\xa0 So certainly he is.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe decision was made on a staff level.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been working closely on the ground with an advisory team.\xc2\xa0 This is not a Panthers game, as you may know.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a national special security event -- is what it\xe2\x80\x99s called.\xc2\xa0 So the criteria used for that is making -- ensuring that we\xe2\x80\x99re not putting the public safety or security of anybody in the audience at risk.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were several weather forecasts that were calling for a 30 to 40 percent chance of thunderstorms tomorrow night, which just to put that in real terms for you, what it means, we would have had to possibly evacuate the stadium if there were thunderstorms.\xc2\xa0 So we know that Mother Nature doesn\'t always cooperate.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, we wish she did.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ve been planning for this, a contingency plan from the day that we announced that there would be an outdoor venue, and so we had alternative plans in place in case this happened.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How does that square, though, with what you said yesterday when we asked about the concerns about weather and you said, we plan to go ahead -- I think you had even mentioned that sporting events happen there, and now you\xe2\x80\x99re saying this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sporting event.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 There\'s a difference between raindrops and severe thunderstorms.\xc2\xa0 And those calls are made by people who have a great deal of experience planning for and preventing a situation like evacuating tens of thousands of people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a call we wanted to make.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we were very much looking forward to having a full and energized and excited crowd in the stadium.\xc2\xa0 And again, as I said before, it\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing, but we made it because it was recommended by the collection of the team on the ground that we needed to plan for it for public safety reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask you, Jen, about the -- or even Jay -- about the change in the platform regarding Jerusalem from 2008.\xc2\xa0 This platform I think for the DNC does not mention them as the capital of Israel.\xc2\xa0 Can you both comment on that and whether you agree with it -- the White House agree with it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, first I\xe2\x80\x99ll say the President\xe2\x80\x99s position has been completely consistent since 2008.\xc2\xa0 He spoke about this in 2008, beyond what was in the platform in 2008.\xc2\xa0 This is being addressed.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything further for you on it other than that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll also say that there are times -- this is one example of a time when a position on an issue where there\xe2\x80\x99s been bipartisan agreement on, Republicans are trying to make it into a wedge issue, and that\'s very disappointing.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you speak to it.</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would simply add that obviously we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some of the concerns expressed about it.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 As President of the United States, the position on Jerusalem held by this administration, this President, is exactly the same position that Presidents and administrations have held since 1967 -- Presidents of both parties, administrations of both parties.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you certainly didn\'t hear leaders of the Republican Party during the George W. Bush administration saying that his position of his government that Jerusalem needed to be resolved in final status negotiations between the two parties -- Israelis and Palestinians -- was "shameful."\xc2\xa0 I didn\'t hear Mitt Romney say that.\xc2\xa0 I certainly didn\'t hear Paul Ryan say that.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can I ask about Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s speech tonight?\xc2\xa0 Will President Obama be watching that speech?\xc2\xa0 And what kind of coordination has there between President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s office and the campaign in crafting his remarks?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, our team has been working closely with President Clinton and his team since the day the President asked him to deliver the speech.\xc2\xa0 You may know some of the colorful characters -- Gene Sperling, people like that -- who worked for President Clinton also work for President Obama.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tThe President will be watching.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s very much looking forward to watching his remarks tonight.\xc2\xa0 He will not be in the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s box.\xc2\xa0 The First Lady will have a group of people in the box.\xc2\xa0 You may already have, but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to get you that list if you don\'t have.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll have more details later on where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching his remarks from.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- helped him with his remarks?\xc2\xa0 Is there --</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I was just using the example -- there were several people from our -- from President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s team who have been working closely with President Clinton and his team from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t want to -- I don\'t mean to single anyone out. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve been closely coordinating on both the message and the content.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs is true of President Obama, President Clinton will probably be tweaking it and fine-tuning it until the very last moment before he takes the stage.\xc2\xa0 Anyone who\'s covered him knows that that\'s what traditionally happens.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tBut I will say we\xe2\x80\x99re very much looking forward to not only hearing President Clinton speak and take down the house and -- bring down the house, not take down the house -- bring down the house at the convention site, but he has a unique background, and 20 years ago, when he was running, he was also facing a Republican -- Republicans who wanted to give tax cuts to the wealthiest.\xc2\xa0 They wanted to slash benefits for the middle class, and he can really speak to experience on why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to take the path that the President has laid out.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\'s the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s position on Rahm Emanuel raising money for Priorities USA?\xc2\xa0 And does that signal some sort of panic mode about being out-raised by the Republicans?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear for months that we expected to be out-raised by the Republicans.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s been very clear that on the super PAC side that\'s evident in the monthly reporting.\xc2\xa0 Rahm Emanuel -- Mayor Emanuel is very close, of course, to the President, a strong supporter of his.\xc2\xa0 And he has said that this is what he thinks is the right -- or his team has said that he thinks this is the best way he can help the President get reelected.\xc2\xa0 So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more about what he feels is the best role he can play between now and November.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Glenn Thrush\'s book I think reported that Rahm Emanuel had pushed earlier to sort of set up a super PAC to raise money like this, and that he was shot down because of the idea the President was sort of against this kind of outside money influence.\xc2\xa0 I don\'t know if you can talk about that and whether you -- there\xe2\x80\x99s any second-guessing now.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, the President has been very clear about his opposition to the Citizens United decision.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s been no secret about that.\xc2\xa0 At the same time, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to bring a butter knife to a knife -- or a butter knife to a gunfight, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also been clear that we don\'t want to play by a different set of rules.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why months ago we\xe2\x80\x99ve encouraged our supporters to give to the Super PAC, despite the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99d love to see greater accountability, greater disclosure.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely -- it\xe2\x80\x99s been a very consistent view on our part.\xc2\xa0 We know this election is going to be close and we need all the tools we can have out there.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to moving the Thursday venue, was there ever a concern about being able to fill the stadium?\xc2\xa0 Did that factor in at all?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Absolutely not.\xc2\xa0 I know that our opponents on the other side of the aisle seem to be pushing this.\xc2\xa0 However, when you had 65,000 ticketed people, 19,000 people on the waiting list, our concern was more about turning people away than it was about filling the stadium.\xc2\xa0 We had an overwhelming response from people in North Carolina.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than 6,000 people participate in this program we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a little bit about called the 9-3-1 program -- nine hours, three shifts, one ticket.\xc2\xa0 Those are people who are now engaged and are going to be a part of this campaign between now and November.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do everything possible -- and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do everything possible -- to make sure all of these people who are unable to attend now because of feisty Mother Nature know how valuable they are.\xc2\xa0 The President is doing a conference call tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re inviting them to events in the future.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s really where our focus is.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why were the organizers telling people that the event was going to go off tomorrow night, rain or shine?\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that inconvenience a lot of people?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, if it were a light drizzle, it might be still in the stadium.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference, as I mentioned before, between the possibility of severe thunderstorms, the risks that that could pose to the tens of thousands of people in the stadium.\xc2\xa0 And there was decision made by an advisory group who have a lot of experience making these calls that we just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put people at that public safety risk.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President be making any stops by the arena tonight to do a walk-through since he can\xe2\x80\x99t go to the stadium?</p>\n<p>\n\tMRS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, given the circumstances and the change, the recent change, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing what\xe2\x80\x99s logistically possible.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any update as of now on that, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you guys updated if that ends up being part of his evening plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will he be meeting with Clinton at all while he\xe2\x80\x99s here in town?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will see him around.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any specific -- there\xe2\x80\x99s no meeting specifically set up, but I know he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to watching his speech -- and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll see what the next few days bring.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jen, will the media -- or can the media have access to that conference call you mentioned that the President is going to have?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 Let me get back to you on that.\xc2\xa0 Let me check on that.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what decision was made.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And do either of you have any reaction from the President on the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s speech last night and what he thought when he watched it?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I spoke with him about it this morning, and he was extremely pleased with the First Lady\xe2\x80\x99s performance, and commented on the power of the words she spoke and the grace and skill with which she delivered the speech.\xc2\xa0 I think any of us -- any of you who saw it I think I\xe2\x80\x99m sure were impressed by it, as I was.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did he get misty?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him if he got misty.</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I can also add just for a little more detail that he called the First Lady last night to just tell her how proud he was of her and what an incredible job she did during her remarks.\xc2\xa0 As you saw in the photo, he watched the speech with his two daughters and with Mrs. Robinson, and they had dinner before the speech and talked about their first day of school because yesterday was the girls\xe2\x80\x99 first day of school.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are the girls coming out to the convention?</p>\n<p>\n\tMS. PSAKI:\xc2\xa0 I believe -- let me double-check.\xc2\xa0 I believe they\xe2\x80\x99ll be here tomorrow evening.\xc2\xa0 But this is their first week of school so they\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not on the plane here, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll get back to you on when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be arriving.</p>\n<p>\n\tQ\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- opinion that the welfare reform ought to go back -- the welfare changes ought to go back to Congress?</p>\n<p>\n\tMR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have seen that report.\xc2\xa0 I can say that this is pretty arcane stuff and there is a many-year, multi-administration dispute between the executive branch and the Congress over how these kinds of guidances should be viewed.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction.</p>\n<p>\n\tThanks, guys.</p>\n<p>\n\tEND\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t2:37 P.M.
