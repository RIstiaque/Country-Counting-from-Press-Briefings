EDT<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 All right, what do you got?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Highlight of trip for you, sir?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s that?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your takeaway from the trip?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your sense of --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You know, the -- a couple of things.\xc2\xa0 Number one, I think all of Asia is eager for American engagement and leadership.\xc2\xa0 We saw that in India; we saw it in Indonesia; we saw it in -- during the G20 and we saw it during APEC.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just from leaders.\xc2\xa0 I was struck when I was at the first school that we went to in Mumbai, and those young kids who were talking about the environment and green technology.\xc2\xa0 On the way down, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what are you guys\xe2\x80\x99 plans?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we\xe2\x80\x99re of course going to go to college.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 I said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to go?\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWell, America, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And so I think that sometimes because we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone through a tough couple of years, there\xe2\x80\x99s a tendency for us to think that somehow Asia is moving and we\xe2\x80\x99re forgotten.\xc2\xa0 And in fact, I think everywhere in Asia, what I heard from leaders and people is that we are still central, and they want us there.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, the second strong impression is, those folks are moving.\xc2\xa0 Korea, China, India, the entire Southeast Asian region -- Japan -- all of them recognize how competitive things are and that they are thinking each and every day about how to educate their workforce, rebuild their infrastructure, enter into new markets.\xc2\xa0 And we should feel confident about our ability to compete, but we are going to have to step up our game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sir, as you look ahead to the coming week, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering how do you sit down at the table --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will be very relaxing.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 How do you approach a meeting with a Senate Republican leader whose life ambition seems to be to make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a second term, and an incoming House Speaker apparent whose mantra seems to be \xe2\x80\x9cno compromise\xe2\x80\x9d?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Campaigning is very different from governing.\xc2\xa0 All of us learn that.\xc2\xa0 And they\xe2\x80\x99re still flush with victory, having run a strategy that was all about saying no.\xc2\xa0 But I am very confident that the American people were not issuing a mandate for gridlock.\xc2\xa0 They want to see us make progress precisely because they understand instinctually how competitive things are and how we have to step up our game.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So my expectation is, when I sit down with Mitch McConnell and John Boehner this week, along with the Democratic leaders, that there are a set of things that need to get done during the lame duck, and that they are not going to want to just obstruct, that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to want to engage constructively.\xc2\xa0 There are going to be some disagreements.\xc2\xa0 There may be some need for compromise.\xc2\xa0 But we should be able at least to get through the lame duck, making sure that taxes don\xe2\x80\x99t go up for middle-class families starting January 1st, that some of the key business provisions that can assure economic growth get done.\xc2\xa0 And then we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a whole bunch of time next year for some serious philosophical debates.\xc2\xa0 And they should welcome those debates next year.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you get the START treaty through the lame duck as well?\xc2\xa0 Seems like an uphill battle right now.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 You know, actually, I feel reasonably good about our prospects.\xc2\xa0 It was voted out of committee with strong bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lugar is somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s made disarmament one of his signature issues.\xc2\xa0 In fact, my first trip overseas was with Dick Lugar to Russia.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a series of conversations with Senator Kyl, whose top priority is making sure that the nuclear arsenal that we do have is modernized.\xc2\xa0 I share that goal.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from senators like McCain and Graham who say they want to see this done. \xc2\xa0<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I think when we look at how important Russian cooperation has been on issues like Iran sanctions, on issues like transit into Afghanistan for our equipment for our troops, my hope and expectation is that, given this is a good treaty, given it has the support of previous Republican senior government officials, that we should be able to get it done.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During the campaign season, you talked about the cost of extending the tax cuts, that that would actually make the U.S. less competitive.\xc2\xa0 Now that you\xe2\x80\x99re indicating that you\xe2\x80\x99re open to some sort of compromise on the tax cuts, how do you do that and also ensure --<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 Well, what I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, Julianna, is that I believe it is a mistake for us to borrow $700 billion to make tax cuts permanent for millionaires and billionaires.\xc2\xa0 It won\xe2\x80\x99t significantly boost the economy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hugely expensive.\xc2\xa0 So we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, I know this is something that, during the campaign at least, the Republicans expressed some strong feelings about.\xc2\xa0 I want to hear from them how strongly they feel about it, particularly given that they\xe2\x80\x99re also saying they want to control the deficit and debt.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if they feel very strongly about it, then I want to get a sense of how they intend to spend -- how they intend to pay for it.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. President, you said it right after the election in the news conference that you were going to do some reflecting about what it meant.\xc2\xa0 And now you\xe2\x80\x99ve had this 10 days away, seeing a lot of different people.\xc2\xa0 Can you reflect at all for us about how you might change your agenda, change your style, and how these travels might have affected your thinking?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 As I said in the press conference the day after the election, I spent the first two years trying to get policy right based on my best judgment about how we were going to deal with the short-term crisis and how we were going to retool to compete in this new global economy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In that obsessive focus on policy, I neglected some things that matter a lot to people, and rightly so:\xc2\xa0 maintaining a bipartisan tone in Washington; dealing with practices like earmarks that are wasteful at a time of -- where everybody else is tightening their belts; making sure that the policy decisions that I made were fully debated with the American people and that I was getting out of Washington and spending more time shaping public opinion and being in a conversation with the American people about why I was making the choices I was making.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I think, moving forward, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to redouble my efforts to go back to some of those first principles.\xc2\xa0 And the fact that we are out of crisis -- although still, obviously, in a difficult time -- I think will give me the capacity to do that.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Anything else?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you get a chance to see the -- look at the new Israeli plans for settlement freeze just yet?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s promising.\xc2\xa0 And so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in contact with both the Israelis and the Palestinians to make sure that we use this opportunity to start negotiating as quickly as possible on some of the final status issues that would render the settlement issue moot.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But I commend Prime Minister Netanyahu for taking I think a very constructive step.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for him to do.\xc2\xa0 But I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a signal that he\xe2\x80\x99s serious, and my hope is, is that he and President Abbas start negotiations immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is Gibbs in line for a Presidential Medal of Freedom for taking on the Indians back there, getting reporters in?<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 THE PRESIDENT:\xc2\xa0 I will say that his foot is still bruised.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 But it was all for a good cause.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 All right, guys.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks a lot, sir.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0
