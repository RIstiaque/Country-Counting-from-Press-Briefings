Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>11:59 A.M. EST</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good day, everyone.\xc2\xa0 Thanks for being here.\xc2\xa0 Welcome to your White House briefing.\xc2\xa0 I have no announcements to make, so we\'ll go straight to the Associated Press.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 The President outlined some pretty dire consequences for the economy today if the sequester takes effect. I\'m wondering, though, if those consequences are so dire why has he not picked up the phone to talk to Senator McConnell about supporting the Senate Democrats plan, and why are the two staffs not in any communication about this deadline.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are in regular communication with Congress about a variety of topics that are high priorities for the President, including the need to ensure that Washington does not manufacture a crisis that puts hundreds of thousands of people\xe2\x80\x99s jobs at risk, as you heard the President talk about today.</p>\n<p>This is a simple thing.\xc2\xa0 Over all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated subject, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple thing:\xc2\xa0 Congress needs to act to make sure we do not allow the so-called sequester to take effect.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s wholly unnecessary and would be a self-inflicted wound on the economy.</p>\n<p>There are ample ways to do this.\xc2\xa0 The Democrats in the Senate and the House have tabled legislation that -- put forward legislation that would buy down the deficit -- buy down the sequester, postpone it to the end of the year in a balanced way. And as the President made clear, there should -- we\'ve done this before, just a few months ago.\xc2\xa0 Republicans supported it then.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we can\'t do it again in order to allow Congress to have the time to work on the regular budgetary process so that we can achieve the larger goal, which is further significant deficit reduction in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 It can\'t be --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer the question about why he\xe2\x80\x99s not, or his staff is not apparently in communication with the top Republican in the Senate on this issue.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, look, we are in regular communication with Congress on a variety of issues, including this.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you in communication with McConnell on this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any calls or communications to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 But this is not a complicated piece of business.\xc2\xa0 The broader issue of further deficit reduction in a balanced way will require time, and that\'s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important for Congress to move forward with a temporary postponement of the sequester, because the consequences of not doing that would be catastrophic, as the President made clear in his event just this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should the sequester take effect -- and we are only 10 days away -- I know the President and the government have outlined some severe consequences, but does the White House think the economy could handle the sequester?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, we believe that the economy would be negatively affected.\xc2\xa0 Outside economists have made clear that the economy would be negatively affected.\xc2\xa0 There is no question that this would set back the recovery and slow down job creation.\xc2\xa0 If we have one fundamental goal here in Washington, it should be to work towards growing the economy and increasing job creation, not doing unnecessary, arbitrary things to halt or reverse that process.</p>\n<p>So we, having calculated specific effects of the sequester if it were to take effect -- a lot of others outside have done that and I don\'t think you can find anyone that I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen anyway that suggests that the effects would not be negative.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And quickly on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a target timeline for when you would put forward the President\xe2\x80\x99s immigration bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We haven\xe2\x80\x99t identified a specific date, Julie.\xc2\xa0 The President has made clear that he is focused on the Senate moving forward on a bipartisan effort to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 He supports that effort.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s also made clear that if that effort stalls or fails, if progress halts, that he is prepared to submit his own legislation for the Senate to act on.\xc2\xa0 But his preference overwhelmingly is for the good progress that\'s been made by that bipartisan group to continue; for it to move forward to a point where a bill is produced that can be voted on and can win support of Democrats and Republicans, move to the House, win support of Democrats and Republicans and get to his desk for his signature.</p>\n<p>One of the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen over the last weeks and months is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a real convergence of positions between the President and both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate about how we should move forward.\xc2\xa0 The blueprint that the President has had online since 2011 that outlined his principles for comprehensive immigration reform is reflected very much in the proposals and ideas that Senator Rubio, for example, has discussed and the so-called Gang of Eight, the bipartisan group in the Senate has been working on.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President remains hopeful that the Senate will move forward because is it absolutely his preference that that\'s what happens.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There had been some talk -- I think the President even raised this and some of his senior advisors have raised early March as a possible benchmark for when he might move forward -- when he wants to see the Senate at least move forward.\xc2\xa0 Is that not the deadline you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we have not actually set a date because we\xe2\x80\x99re looking for progress.\xc2\xa0 I think that what we have seen and I think you have seen is reports that the senators themselves who are involved in this effort have talked about March.\xc2\xa0 That would certainly be a good thing and a welcomed thing, because the President is very interested in progress being made and interested in this process moving forward quickly, even though it is important and significant work that needs to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>But we have not set a deadline.\xc2\xa0 We are focused on working with the Senate, working with those members who want to put together a package that can earn broad bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0 And as long as that progress continues, we will remain hopeful that it will produce a bill that the President can ultimately sign and we can get this very important piece of business done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Simpson and Bowles struck again.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Today, they rolled out a new, updated plan for $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years and that includes spending cuts and health care reforms and tax reforms.\xc2\xa0 And where does the President stand on this new package?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, the chairmen\xc2\xa0 -- the co-chairmen of the President\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal commission, today, once again, obliterated the argument put forward by Republicans that we should pursue further deficit reduction in an unbalanced way.\xc2\xa0 Nobody who has addressed this issue credibly and seriously has come up with a plan that does not include the essential balance that the President supports.\xc2\xa0 And that certainly includes Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, and it includes both the work they did on the commission and what they put forward again today.</p>\n<p>So the President believes, outside economists believe, bipartisan panels and commissions and groups and gatherings and salons agree, that we need to do this in a balanced way, that that\xe2\x80\x99s the responsible way to reduce our deficit, to reach that goal of at least $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years that stabilizes our fiscal situation, puts us on a fiscally sustainable path in terms of the relationship between deficits and debt to GDP.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President, in every effort with the Speaker of the House and in his budgets and in his submission to the super committee, has put forward a balanced deficit reduction plan that includes more spending cuts than revenues, but insists that we do this in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s fair to senior citizens and middle-class families and others so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask those groups of Americans to bear the burden solely of deficit reduction while saying that wealthy individuals and corporations can be held harmless.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That, unfortunately, is the approach that Republicans have taken all along, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the approach they\xe2\x80\x99re taking right now with regards to the sequester.\xc2\xa0 They would rather, if their position holds, see hundreds of thousands of Americans have their jobs threatened, have our national security endangered, than ask wealthy corporations and individuals to forsake some loopholes in the tax code.\xc2\xa0 That is a very tough position to sell, we believe.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President support the specifics of this updated Simpson-Bowles plan?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has his own plan, and it has been very clear, again, going back to the submission to the super committee, the submission of the President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, the proposals and counteroffers that the President made in his negotiations with the Speaker of the House late last year, the leftover portions of which remain on the table and are available for action today, including the very tough choices the President was willing to make when it came to further spending cuts and entitlement reform.\xc2\xa0 But there has to be balance.\xc2\xa0 It has to include the kind of tax reform that produces revenue that Speaker Boehner himself embraced just a few months ago but suddenly now has decided is bad policy or unnecessary -- that they would rather seniors foot the bill, or middle-class families trying to send their kids to college, or in the case of the impact of the sequester, see first responders lose their jobs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s just bad policy, and the President doesn\'t support it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I understand your not wanting to announce anything about -- any calls to announce, but I want to make sure I understand what the President is willing to do to help get a deal done.\xc2\xa0 He said his door is open.\xc2\xa0 What kind of direct presidential involvement does the White House think would be helpful here?\xc2\xa0 Phone calls, meetings, getting the Vice President involved?\xc2\xa0 I just want to see what\xe2\x80\x99s in the universe of possibility.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President, the Vice President, the senior members of the administration both in the Cabinet and at the White House are actively engaged with Congress, with congressional offices and congressional members, on a variety of legislative priorities, including the need to avoid the sequester, including the need to achieve significant further balanced deficit reduction, including comprehensive immigration reform, including reducing gun violence, and those efforts will continue.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t read out every phone call or every meeting, but we are working with Congress on all of these priorities.</p>\n<p>When it comes to avoiding the sequester, there are really -- we are down to 10 days here.\xc2\xa0 The options here are pretty clear: Do what Senate Democrats and House Democrats have proposed, which is postpone the sequester by a certain amount of time through reductions in the deficit that are achieved in a balanced way through both revenues and cuts; or embrace the Republican position that they have held thus far, which is to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s better for all those negative effects to take place when the sequester is implemented than to ask corporate jet owners or oil and gas companies to give up their special tax breaks that average Americans don\'t enjoy.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s just bad policy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, why not say the President is going to have a meeting or going to call Speaker Boehner or Senator McConnell?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 But we will -- the President has made clear his door is open.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the Republicans thus far is a categorical refusal at least at the leadership level to accept the basic principle that balance is necessary.\xc2\xa0 They would rather adopt a position that says seniors have to bear the burden, middle-class families have to bear the burden, the wealthiest individuals and corporations will be held harmless; and if you don\'t adopt that extremist position, then the sequester goes into effect with all of the harmful impacts that the President detailed today.</p>\n<p>The door is open, but balance is absolutely essential.\xc2\xa0 Balance is what -- again, going back to Matt\xe2\x80\x99s question -- is what bipartisan panels have always recommended.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s what economists say is necessary.\xc2\xa0 We should not allow our economy to be held hostage to sort of reckless partisan agendas.\xc2\xa0 That\'s bad for the economy.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the middle class.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And lastly, everyone agrees that the sequester is a bad idea, but didn\'t it originate -- the idea for the sequester originate here at the White House?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this a lot -- I know you\xe2\x80\x99re filling in -- but here\xe2\x80\x99s the fundamental fact.\xc2\xa0 During the deficit reduction of the debt ceiling negotiations, because the Republicans refused to embrace balance, refused in the end to join hands with the President and pursue a grand bargain, there was an absolute necessity to avoid default, and both sides were looking for trigger mechanisms -- this is complicated budget-speak -- to help make this package possible.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The sequester was something that was discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward because it was put forward by Republican Senator Gramm and Rudman back in the \xe2\x80\x9880s as part of the Gramm-Rudman deal -- there is a history here to this.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear:\xc2\xa0 Republicans embraced it.\xc2\xa0 Every member of the House Republican leadership voted for it.\xc2\xa0 Nearly two to one in the House Republicans voted for it over Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And on the day it passed, the Speaker of the House said he got 98 percent of what he wanted and that he was pretty happy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The issue here is the sequester was designed never to take effect because it was supposed to force Congress to do responsible, difficult things, make choices about how we reduce our deficit in a way that would allow us to avoid the sequester, the indiscriminate, across-the-board, devastating cuts that the sequester represents.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Republicans have thus far all along the way refused to go along with the fundamental principle of balance, that we need to do this with spending cuts -- tough spending cuts, with entitlement reforms and with revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I want to jump around.\xc2\xa0 Lynn Sweet in the back -- how are you?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fine, thank you.\xc2\xa0 There was another tragic shooting in Chicago just a few days ago.\xc2\xa0 It was a young girl whose sister was at the Obama speech last week.\xc2\xa0 I\'m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any reaching out from the White House to her family.\xc2\xa0 The funeral hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet.\xc2\xa0 Any particular message in the wake of another horrific shooting with this close connection to the Obama speech with her sister being there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have any communications to report to you, Lynn.\xc2\xa0 This is another example, tragic example of a young life being taken away by the scourge of gun violence in this country, and is a reminder of why we need to act together here in Washington to do everything we can to reduce gun violence, to do it in a way that, as the President has insisted, respects our Second Amendment rights, but to take necessary action to reduce this scourge, because it is taking too many young lives in America.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there some communication since there was --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have anything on that right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Jackie.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Back to the sequester.\xc2\xa0 When you say, and the President says his door is open, that\xe2\x80\x99s a rather passive construction.\xc2\xa0 Is there anything -- why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he go to their door, knock on their door?\xc2\xa0 And also --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We\'ve been clear, Jackie, about what our position is.\xc2\xa0 We have supported the bills that have been put forward by Senate Democrats and House Democrats.\xc2\xa0 And when we talk here about leadership and doing the responsible thing, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, as the President said if you accept the basic premise that Democrats are more resistant than Republicans to savings from entitlements or spending cuts, and Republicans are more resistant to savings through revenues, what have the Democrats done?\xc2\xa0 What has the President done?\xc2\xa0 Consistently put forward proposals that include not just revenues; they haven\'t put forward proposals that reduce our deficits solely through raising taxes or increasing revenues or tax reform.\xc2\xa0 No.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward proposals that have cut spending, including through entitlement reforms, by more than two to one.</p>\n<p>Thus far, the President -- and Senator Simpson and Erskine Bowles noted this I think today in their presentation -- the President has overseen more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t always been pretty, but the fact is this President has signed into law more than $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 And thus far, more than two-thirds of that has come through spending cuts.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We need balance.\xc2\xa0 And the President\xe2\x80\x99s door is open.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\'t seen from Republicans thus far is a proposal that reflects the essential ingredient of balance.\xc2\xa0 We know that they want to voucherize Medicare.\xc2\xa0 We know that they want to ask seniors to bear the burden, or middle-class families to foot the bill.\xc2\xa0 But that is bad policy.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable to this President.</p>\n<p>What they should do is take their cue from Senator Simpson and Mr. Bowles and from others who have said balance is the way we have to move forward.\xc2\xa0 And we would welcome that in the short-term buy-down of the sequester and in the overall tackling of the problem.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You also said, we\'re working with Congress on all these priorities.\xc2\xa0 That just means congressional Democrats, right?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Like last week\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Senate Democrats?\xc2\xa0 Where have you worked with Republicans?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been -- going to the question I had earlier about immigration reform -- we\'ve been working with every member\xe2\x80\x99s office that\'s involved in the Gang of Eight process.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, met with the Democrats associated with the Gang of Eight on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 Our communications with every interested party in that group will continue.\xc2\xa0 And we are engaged with Congress, members of both parties, offices from both parties, on a variety of issues and all of the priorities that the President has put forward.</p>\n<p>But let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear.\xc2\xa0 The problem here isn\'t a lack of meetings around the table in the Roosevelt Room or the Cabinet Room.\xc2\xa0 We saw that in the summer of 2011, when the Speaker of the House decided not to pursue the grand bargain.\xc2\xa0 We saw it again in December in the exhaustively reported fact that the Speaker walked away from what was, by any measure, a fair compromise that the President put forward that represented a willingness to come more than halfway towards the Republicans on both revenue and spending, and unfortunately, the Speaker walked away from that effort.</p>\n<p>So we have put forward a number of proposals.\xc2\xa0 We will continue to work with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 The Senate needs to act.\xc2\xa0 The House needs to act.\xc2\xa0 We need to avoid this sequester because those who are affected most are middle-class families across the country.</p>\n<p>Jon, then Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You said that you\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to the members of -- the Republicans on immigration.\xc2\xa0 Senator Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s office just put something out saying, \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s office has never discussed immigration policy with anyone in the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 Who\xe2\x80\x99s telling the truth?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We have been in contact with everybody involved in this effort on Capitol Hill.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re not telling the truth?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re reading to me from a BlackBerry.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you what I know about the White House\xe2\x80\x99s efforts.\xc2\xa0 Actually it\xe2\x80\x99s an iPhone.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s an iPhone.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Is that a 5?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a 4S.\xc2\xa0 On the question of the sequester, has the President had a single face-to-face meeting with Republican leaders since January 1st about averting these spending cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any meetings to read out to you.\xc2\xa0 Again, we don\xe2\x80\x99t report every meeting, every conversation.\xc2\xa0 I would note that in the summer of 2011 and again at the end of last year, the negotiations and consultations that took place with Republican leaders, in particular the Speaker of the House, some of which were secret, were secret not because we called for them to be secret, okay?\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be clear about our history here and about how --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\'re suggesting there have been meetings.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting anything about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying that we don\xe2\x80\x99t always read out every conversation or meeting we have with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And in taking that approach, we\xe2\x80\x99re mindful of the requests of others as well as our own interests.</p>\n<p>Our interests here, the President\xe2\x80\x99s interest here is making sure that Congress acts to avoid the wholly unnecessary, indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts that are represented by the sequester; that Congress do the responsible thing, adopt a balanced package that postpones the sequester so that Congress can then work on a broader deficit reduction plan that is part of the budget process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there is no reason to do this in a different manner.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason to inflict this wound on our economy unnecessarily.\xc2\xa0 This deadline is manufactured.\xc2\xa0 It can be postponed as it was in December, and by doing that, we would allow ourselves more time to pursue the ultimate goal, which is achieving -- finishing the job of at least the $4 trillion goal outlined for many years by many economists as what we need to do over 10 years in terms of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We can do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President has put forward a plan that does that.\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward a plan that includes revenues and also spending cuts and entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 What we have not seen from Republicans is a plan that includes revenues, as well as spending cuts and entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 I mean, you guys have to understand the basic nature here.\xc2\xa0 If you\'re talking about compromise and leadership, and you accept the premise that it\xe2\x80\x99s harder for Democrats to go along with entitlement reforms and harder for Democrats to go with cuts to spending programs -- let\xe2\x80\x99s just accept that premise -- what has the President done?\xc2\xa0 What have the Democrats done?\xc2\xa0 They have put forward and embraced proposals that have more spending cuts -- more savings from cuts than they have increases in revenue.\xc2\xa0 What we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen from the Republicans in anything like a commensurate action by them.\xc2\xa0 And the American people insist that we compromise here in Washington.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But when we hear about these draconian cuts in Border Patrol agents being furloughed, FBI agents, and kids getting thrown off Head Start, is there really no way to find $85 billion in cuts in a $3.8 trillion budget without those kind of draconian cuts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear, as Danny Werfel was when he briefed you guys last week.\xc2\xa0 There is no way to do this -- $85 billion over that short window of time -- there is no way if you follow the law written by Congress, that implementation of these cuts would not have the draconian, drastic effects that the President talked about today, and that everybody who has written about this has talked about, or everybody who has spoken about this has made clear will happen.</p>\n<p>The fact is that the sequester was written, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, precisely because the cuts would be onerous and unacceptable to both sides -- to all sides.\xc2\xa0 And they were supposed to -- the looming nature of the sequester was supposed to compel Congress to act responsibly and to compromise, and to achieve the kind of deficit reduction through compromise that is necessary to help put us on a fiscally sustainable path.</p>\n<p>The obstacle thus far to compromise has been the adamant refusal by Republicans to agree to a balanced approach to deficit reduction, a balanced approach that the American people support, that Democrats, independents and even Republicans outside of Washington support.</p>\n<p>Major.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Reaction to the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 He released a statement right after the President spoke:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cThe American people understand,\xe2\x80\x9d quoting him directly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the revenue debate is now closed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\'s from the Speaker.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cWe should close loopholes and carve-outs in the tax code, but that revenue should be used to lower rates across the board.\xc2\xa0 Tax reform is a once-in-a-generation operation to boost job creation in America.\xc2\xa0 It should not be squandered,\xe2\x80\x9d the Speaker\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cto enable more Washington spending.\xc2\xa0 Spending is the problem.\xc2\xa0 Spending must the focus.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, the Speaker is I guess misunderstanding the proposition here, which is to use tax reform and revenue gleaned from it to help reduce the deficit, which, as I understand it, at least in the aftermath of a Republican President holding power, is the number-one goal of Republicans in Congress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>What the Speaker put forward or said he was willing to put forward at the end of last year was up to $800 billion in revenue that would go towards deficit reduction, achieved from the wealthiest Americans and businesses by tax reform, closing loopholes, capping deductions.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tThe President agrees with him that we ought to close those loopholes and cap those deductions and reform our tax code in a way that makes it more balanced and more fair, that ends some of these taxpayer subsidies to companies and individuals that have, because of their armies of accountants, have a different relationship with the tax code than average Americans and small businesses.</p>\n<p>The goal here is deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The goal here is achieving it in a balanced way.\xc2\xa0 The President has signed into law over $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 The ratio of spending cuts to revenues, more than two to one.\xc2\xa0 If you take the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposal that\'s still on the table to Speaker Boehner, if he were to take that, if Speaker Boehner were suddenly to embrace the consensus that has built around the idea of balance and say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that deal, that would, again, be more spending cuts than revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We need to get this done.\xc2\xa0 And we need to do it in a way that the American people support, that bipartisan commissions support, that everybody -- even Republicans who aren\xe2\x80\x99t elected and sent to Washington -- seems to agree is the right way to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m also going to read you something from Alan Simpson. He said many things this morning, but this is a direct quote, regarding entitlement reform:\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cIt will happen in four years, or he\xe2\x80\x9d -- meaning the President -- \xe2\x80\x9cwill have no legacy at all.\xc2\xa0 If he\xe2\x80\x9d -- the President -- \xe2\x80\x9ccan\'t cut the mustard in the solvency of Social Security under honest appraisals of the trustees and he can\'t get a handle on automatic pilot rate of health care spending, he will have a failed presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your question?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you agree or disagree?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has put forward entitlement reforms.\xc2\xa0 He has passed an Affordable Care Act that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is Alan Simpson talking about what\xe2\x80\x99s already been proposed by the President.\xc2\xa0 Sounds to me like he doesn\'t think it\xe2\x80\x99s enough.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, what he has said -- you\xe2\x80\x99re quoting to me from something that I will take at your word for it is accurate. But the President agrees we need to pass further entitlement reform.\xc2\xa0 We need to do it in a way that reduce, when it comes to our health care entitlements -- which, by the way, everybody agrees is the main drive of our long-term deficit and debt challenge -- that does it in a way that reduces our health care costs, doesn\'t just shift costs to seniors.\xc2\xa0 I mean, that has been the approach through voucherization or other proposals by Republicans that is wholly unfair to seniors and doesn\'t make sense economically.</p>\n<p>We need to take actions that reduce health care costs.\xc2\xa0 That\'s what the Affordable Care Act does.\xc2\xa0 In the second 10 years after its implementation, as you know, or after its passage, there are enormous savings, as scored by CBO, from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\xc2\xa0 And one of the purposes of that priority that the President successfully signed into law in his first term was addressing the need to reduce our overall health care costs going forward.\xc2\xa0 More work needs to be done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President again -- let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to the simple principle, when it comes to further deficit reduction, the President hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just proposed revenues.\xc2\xa0 In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s signed into law two-to-one more spending cuts than revenue increases.\xc2\xa0 He has proposed in his various submissions to Congress and his negotiations with the Speaker of the House entitlement reforms, including decisions that represent very tough calls for Democrats.\xc2\xa0 But he is leading on this issue because he understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p>\n<p>But he also understands that we need to do it in a way, as he said today, that ensures that our economy can continue to grow, that ensures that our economy is receiving the necessary investments in education and research and development and innovation and infrastructure that make sure that five, 10, 20 and 40 years from now, we still have that powerful economic engine in this country that has been the envy of the world for so many years and so many decades.</p>\n<p>As you know, because you and I both covered it in the \xe2\x80\x9890s, when we achieved as a nation budget surpluses for the first time in decades, it was a result of tough choices, leadership by President Clinton, tough choices by Congress, and significant economic growth.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s why we cannot lose sight of the overall goal here, which is a growing economy and an economy that\'s creating good, middle-class jobs.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On immigration, Senator Rubio said if what was released or leaked this weekend were sent to Congress, it would be DOA, and that its very release politicized the process and damaged the possibilities of achieving reform.\xc2\xa0 Would you react to both of those?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would say a couple of things which I think most of you should be aware of, which is that this was not an intentional release.\xc2\xa0 That was clear by the fact that the White House reached out to the offices of those who are leading the effort on immigration reform in the Senate to make clear that our focus continues to be and our hopes continue to lie with the bipartisan effort underway in the Senate to achieve comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 It is by far the President\xe2\x80\x99s preference that the Senate process move forward, that the bipartisan Group of Eight have success and that they produce a bill that wins the support of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, then in the House, and that it arrives at his desk for his signature.</p>\n<p>What I would note is that in the blueprint the President has had on WhiteHouse.gov for a couple of years, there is a remarkable convergence of policy specifics between what the President supports and has supported since there was legislation in the Senate and what the Group of Eight has been working on, including the Republican senators who are part of that group.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we\xe2\x80\x99re very hopeful that, as Denis McDonough said this weekend, the Senate will move forward.\xc2\xa0 We believe that\'s the best way for this to happen.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve also said -- made clear that we will prepare legislation and submit it if that process in the Senate fails.\xc2\xa0 But we want the process in the Senate to succeed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will you release and propose legislation that includes what was not visible this weekend which was any mention of a future legal immigration system also dealing with guest workers and a lot of the complex areas of immigration reform that are unrelated to dealing with legalization or border security?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, our goal is, as Denis McDonough said on one of the shows this Sunday, to not propose -- to our own Jon Karl -- to not propose or submit legislation --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are you committed to future flow reform?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve said that we will work with Congress, and with the Senate in particular, as they undertake this effort on those issues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If you look at the blueprint, the President\xe2\x80\x99s ideas on this are pretty detailed and specific in terms of broader comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 But further to my point, in answer to your first question, our interest is in seeing the Senate process, the bipartisan process succeed.</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Did you have a nice weekend?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I had a great weekend sledding with my children.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Where?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Up where there\xe2\x80\x99s snow.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple questions, one on cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s an independent report out today suggesting that there are billions of trade secrets that we\xe2\x80\x99re losing to China.\xc2\xa0 The President addressed this in the State of the Union, put out an executive order last Tuesday as I recall.\xc2\xa0 Can the White House assure the American people that this executive order is going to actually put a dent in that so that we\xe2\x80\x99re not losing billions of trade secrets a year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the Mandiant report that you are referring to and we\xe2\x80\x99re aware of its contents, but I am not going to talk about assessments -- intelligence assessments that we make or may be making.\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re correct in noting the President\xe2\x80\x99s keen focus on this issue.\xc2\xa0 It is a major challenge for us in the national security arena.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The United States has substantial and growing concerns about the threats to U.S. economic and national security posed by cyber intrusions, including the theft of commercial information.\xc2\xa0 As the President said in the State of the Union, \xe2\x80\x9cWe know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The President also said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s why the United States government is taking an active approach to addressing the issue of cyber theft.\xc2\xa0 We have urged Congress to pass legislation, and the President is taking all steps he can through the executive branch to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re safeguarding government networks and providing helpful and useful and relevant information to the private sector to help them safeguard their networks.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the sequester, we went back and checked the record. On November 21, 2011, the President, after the super committee failed, came into this room -- and Republicans on the Hill were talking about coming up with other cuts to deal with, as the President calls it, draconian cuts from the sequester -- they were trying to come up with other ways to deal with this.\xc2\xa0 The President came in this room and immediately said he would veto such a bill to come up with other cuts.\xc2\xa0 So how does he now have the credibility to say the sequester would be so awful if the Republicans were saying over a year ago let\xe2\x80\x99s find another way to deal with it, and he said I\xe2\x80\x99ll veto that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Ed, I know, because you were here, that you know that\xe2\x80\x99s not an actual account of what he was talking about.\xc2\xa0 There were efforts underway by Republicans in Congress to replace the sequester, which was half defense, half nondefense, with cuts only in nondefense.\xc2\xa0 And that was basically saying Republicans were crossing their fingers when they all voted overwhelmingly for the sequester, when every Republican leader in the House voted for the sequester, including Chairman Ryan, Speaker Boehner, and others -- Eric Cantor and Kevin McCarthy.\xc2\xa0 The fact is that that is an unfair and unbalanced approach.\xc2\xa0 So, yes, we do not support undoing the sequester in a way that says, you know what, we\xe2\x80\x99ll throw double the number of kids out of Head Start; we\xe2\x80\x99ll make double the amount of cuts to education, to investments in research and development; we\xe2\x80\x99ll cut double the number of security guards on our border.\xc2\xa0 That is completely inappropriate to the task and the need here.</p>\n<p>The President believes that Congress needs to act in a balanced, responsible way, first to buy down the sequester so that it can then move forward with broader, balanced deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s a canard, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through this -- that Republicans use this quote as though it represents something that everybody in this room knows it does not represent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So if you do want a balanced approach, the last time the President had a chance on deficit reduction was the fiscal cliff talks just a few weeks back, and he signed into law $600 billion in tax increases and something like $10 or $15 billion in spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 So does the White House really -- can you tell the American people that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, you were here.\xc2\xa0 The President put forward a proposal that represented significant compromise that was judged by outsiders as coming and meeting the Republicans more than halfway on revenues, more than halfway on spending cuts and entitlement reforms, and the Speaker of the House walked away from that deal -- walked away from it.\xc2\xa0 But guess what, that deal is still on the table, and it includes, as you know, very tough choices by this President for Democrats when it comes to entitlements and spending cuts.</p>\n<p>So, again, we have -- the President has always sought a bigger deal, has always sought a bill or legislation that\xe2\x80\x99s balanced, that would achieve that goal of $400 [sic] trillion-plus over 10 years.\xc2\xa0 He continues to have hope that Congress, that Republicans will take him up on the remainder of that proposal that he offered to the Speaker that the Speaker walked away from.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, we need to make sure that we don\xe2\x80\x99t let this sequester take effect with all of its devastating effects on first responders and kids in Head Start and our national security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s just mindless and reckless -- it\xe2\x80\x99s a mindless and reckless approach to policy in Washington for Congress not to do the responsible thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, last thing I do want to ask you about is access around here to the President.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been a lot of commentary about the golf situation.\xc2\xa0 This Friday, though, the President has -- I think it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday that he has the Japanese Prime Minister coming in for a meeting.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on with the Japanese economy that obviously has international implications.\xc2\xa0 There are island disputes between China and Japan that have a lot of people nervous.\xc2\xa0 When the President meets with the Japanese Prime Minister, will the White House Press Corps come in and get a chance to actually ask questions of the President?\xc2\xa0 Is that your plan on Friday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Look, Ed, I am completely sympathetic, having covered two White Houses, to the difficulties of the job covering any White House, and the desire for more and more access.\xc2\xa0 And I am -- we work every day with you and others to provide that.\xc2\xa0 And we will continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a scheduling announcement for an event on Friday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re sympathetic to us as a former correspondent, do you think the President should take questions --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would note that -- and this is important to note, given some of the coverage of this issue -- that when it comes to solo news conferences where the President of the United States stands up and for 40 minutes, 50 minutes or an hour takes your questions, allowing reporters to go deep on issues -- President Obama has given 35 of those.\xc2\xa0 President Bush, his immediate predecessor, gave 19.\xc2\xa0 So also, when it comes to interviews, the President has given 591 interviews since he took office.\xc2\xa0 So I think that it is clear that we are making an effort to provide access to make sure that the President is being questioned by reporters, and anchors, and others, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And what reporters?\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the question.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re saying interviews -- there\xe2\x80\x99s 500 interviews.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 A hundred and four of those interviews were with major networks -- television networks.</p>\n<p>Kristen, did you have anything?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jay, does the President have a reaction to the criticism that his administration has not been transparent?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He deputizes me to have that reaction.\xc2\xa0 And I would say, again, having been where you are, I understand -- and I doubt that there\xe2\x80\x99s ever been a White House press corps that\xe2\x80\x99s ever been wholly satisfied with the level of access that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been afforded -- but we work very closely with all of you to try to provide access to the President.\xc2\xa0 I would note that when I was covering President Bush -- George W. Bush, I was on his first trip on Air Force One.\xc2\xa0 It was a short trip down to Norfolk, I believe, and he came back and spoke to the pool.\xc2\xa0 That was his first trip.\xc2\xa0 For the next three years that I covered the President, he never came back again.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What did you ask?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Very hard questions, tough questions.\xc2\xa0 But the point is -- my only point is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been there.\xc2\xa0 When I covered President Clinton, there were periods of immense frustration.\xc2\xa0 When I came to this room in the spring of 1993, the White House Press Corps, as those of you who were here remember, was in a state of rebellion over the situation here in terms of press relations.\xc2\xa0 This is not uncommon.\xc2\xa0 I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t think we have that here, and we are working every day to provide the kind of access that we believe is an essential part of the work you do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, and I guess more broadly, did the events of this weekend make you rethink the level of transparency within this administration?\xc2\xa0 And can we expect to see --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean the events of this weekend -- the fact that the President wanted to play golf with a golf pro?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, and some of the criticism that you got in the wake of not just what happened this weekend, but also some of the meetings that haven\xe2\x80\x99t been read out to the press as of later that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t been made aware of in advance.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, you would have to be more specific about the question on the issue of this weekend.\xc2\xa0 I mean, the President had some downtime; he was playing golf.\xc2\xa0 I understand that there was a desire to have access or a photograph of that, but the President was having --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, a confirmation of what was happening --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We did provide you the first official confirmation of that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It took several hours.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The first official confirmation that anybody in this room received of that event and the people that the President was playing golf with was from the White House press office.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t control everybody who\xe2\x80\x99s around and purporting to be reporting on the event.\xc2\xa0 But nobody -- no reporter had any access that was different from the White House Press Corps on that matter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just shifting to Simpson and Bowles --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Go ahead, Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One more on Simpson-Bowles.\xc2\xa0 Specifically to look at the issue of entitlements, they\xe2\x80\x99re calling for $600 billion in entitlement reform, which I believe is about $200 billion more than what you have said you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to offer.\xc2\xa0 So will the President move on that issue of entitlements?\xc2\xa0 Will he give more?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, first of all, the President has put forward -- unlike any Republicans -- a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes entitlement reforms, tax reform, and spending cuts.\xc2\xa0 He has signed into law over $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction thus far with a ratio of more than 2 to 1 -- spending cuts to revenue increases.</p>\n<p>The President agrees with outside economists that have been saying this for a number of years now that we need to achieve in deficit reduction the target of $4 trillion over 10 years that will help put us on a fiscally sustainable path that will reduce the size of our deficits and debt as a ratio to GDP that will give us that fiscal sustainability.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is an issue that, as a country, we will continue to have to deal with.\xc2\xa0 But the President believes that the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s made -- he knows that the proposals he\xe2\x80\x99s made, if Congress were to adopt them, would achieve that goal and would do it in a way that allows our economy to continue to grow, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t punish seniors or ask seniors or middle-class families to bear the burden of deficit reduction alone, and that makes our tax code fairer and simpler for everyone in the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to some economists who say it appears likely at this point that the sequester is going to kick in.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration share that view that it\xe2\x80\x99s likely it will kick in, at least for a week or two?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a prediction to make.\xc2\xa0 What the President made clear today is that it should not happen.\xc2\xa0 There is no reason for it to happen.\xc2\xa0 Congress has within its power, Republicans have it within their power to agree to the basic principle that we should buy down the sequester for a certain amount of time to allow Congress to then move forward with broader deficit reduction through the budget process.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>If they do not do that, they will be making a choice -- Republicans will be making a choice to allow the sequester to take effect with all of the negative impacts that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about, rather than accept the principle that corporate jet owners should give up their tax break; that oil and gas companies should no longer be subsidized through the massive amount that they\xe2\x80\x99re subsidized by the taxpayer anymore, that that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make good policy; that we ought to do things in a way that are balanced -- in ways that are balanced so that we don\xe2\x80\x99t ask seniors and others to bear the burden of deficit reduction alone.</p>\n<p>Stephen, and then Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President says often when he meets with Chinese leaders that China should submit to the rules of the road of the international economy.\xc2\xa0 If the government is sponsoring a PLA unit to steal U.S. company secrets, does that suggest that approach is not working?\xc2\xa0 And does the White House countenance having any firmer measures?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 First of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any comment on that report and the specific allegations.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials, including in the military, and we will continue to do so.\xc2\xa0 This is a very important challenge.\xc2\xa0 It is one the President has been working on and urging Congress to take action on for quite some time, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.</p>\n<p>The United States and China are among the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest cyber actors, and it is vital that we continue a sustained, meaningful dialogue and work together to develop an understanding of acceptable behavior in cyberspace.</p>\n<p>Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Same topic.\xc2\xa0 The President did his executive order on cybersecurity on February 12th.\xc2\xa0 The New York Times reported today that the administration is going to be taking a more aggressive defense beginning today.\xc2\xa0 Is there more that you --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no initiatives to announce today.\xc2\xa0 This is an issue that has the attention of the President and senior levels of the national security team.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that we are working on constantly, and we will of course take necessary measures to enhance our cybersecurity and to assist the private sector in enhancing their cybersecurity.\xc2\xa0 But I have no new measures to give you.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will there be any reaction at all to the report from the --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s a private report.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you an assessment of our view of the problem and the fact that we, when it comes to China, regularly raise this issue with Chinese officials, including officials in the military.</p>\n<p>Scott.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, Senator McConnell put out a statement after the President\xe2\x80\x99s event this morning suggesting that he could move money around to hold first responders harmless by maybe hitting green energy programs or something like that.\xc2\xa0 That seemed to be at odds with what Danny Werfel said about the government\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility.\xc2\xa0 Is he mischaracterizing how much flexibility the government has to --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the statement.\xc2\xa0 There is not the flexibility that some would suggest exists because the law is written the way it is, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money in a short period of time not dealing with our entire $3.4 trillion, as Jon said, but with just defense and nondefense discretionary spending.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is you cannot do this in a way that would not have tremendously harmful effects.\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen the quote that you\xe2\x80\x99ve mentioned.\xc2\xa0 But let\xe2\x80\x99s say you were to do that, does that mean you add another 50,000 people -- kids that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to throw off of Head Start?\xc2\xa0 Does it mean another 100 border security -- Border agents that you furlough?\xc2\xa0 The fact is the impacts are highly harmful to the economy.\xc2\xa0 They would result in hundreds of thousands of people having their jobs put at risk and would, by outside economists\xe2\x80\x99 assessments, do severe harm to the recovery that\'s been underway now for quite some time from the Great Recession.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just aside from the merits of whatever you might substitute, it sounded like from what Werfel said, the money is by account, and you can\'t even move it among accounts.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Scott, I think I would rely on the experts here, and Danny Werfel is an expert.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, the whole point of the sequester, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not mistaken, was to come up with a plan that was so painful that no way would anybody want it to go into effect.\xc2\xa0 Does it now look as though it\xe2\x80\x99s not painful enough?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would point you to numerous statements by numerous Republicans, including leading Republicans last year, about the devastating effect of sequester and how it would have -- we should avoid it at all costs.</p>\n<p>And then I would point you to an article in The Wall Street Journal in which recently the Speaker of the House boasted that he had the support of Republicans in the House to allow sequester to take effect with all of its harmful impacts, and that he \xe2\x80\x9chas it in his pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d as a play, a political play in his negotiations with Democrats and the White House.</p>\n<p>The leverage that he\xe2\x80\x99s discussing in that article sounds abstract and esoteric.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s about the political battle here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 But the leverage really has to do with people in the country who will lose their jobs, people -- families in the country who will be affected if our economy stops growing.\xc2\xa0 That\'s the leverage.\xc2\xa0 Those are the -- that\'s the collateral damage to the kind of reckless partisanship that allowing the sequester to take effect represents; and partisanship in the service of trying to achieve an ideological goal, a goal that is not supported by the country, that was much debated during the election campaign last year, and an issue on which the American people spoke very clearly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Sam Stein, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, can you give a little bit more specific on how the White House defines a balanced replacement to the sequester?\xc2\xa0 If it\xe2\x80\x99s not 50/50 revenues, taxes, what percentage would you qualify as balanced?\xc2\xa0 And on the spending cuts side, if some of those cuts didn\'t include defense, would the White House consider that balanced?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Balanced means revenues as well as cuts, spending cuts, first of all.\xc2\xa0 And then I would note that we support the proposals put forward by Senate Democrats and House Democrats, and you can evaluate them in terms of ratios.</p>\n<p>But balance here means adopting the basic principle that was reiterated again by Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson today, that is embraced by bipartisan groups, by outside economists and by average Americans across the country regardless of their political affiliation, and that is that we should not ask seniors alone to bear the burden of deficit reduction.\xc2\xa0 We should not ask middle-class families alone to bear the burden of deficit reduction; that everybody ought to do their fair share.\xc2\xa0 And the way to achieve that is through balance.\xc2\xa0 Balance that, in every one of the President\xe2\x80\x99s proposals, has included more in spending cuts than in revenues.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Again, going back to the fundamental disconnect here between what Republicans have demonstrated themselves willing to do and what the President has shown himself willing to do and the leadership that he has shown in putting forward plans that represent significant spending cuts, represent significant savings through entitlement reforms.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no specific ratio of spending cuts to tax revenues that you would consider is balanced versus not balanced?\xc2\xa0 Same with cuts as defense and nondefense?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is an overall approach here to the broader package of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that the President has talked about.\xc2\xa0 When you\'re talking about the buy-down, we support the legislation put forward by Senate and House Democrats.</p>\n<p>Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the quantitative number of job cuts possibly lost through the sequestration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get that for you.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t12:50 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
