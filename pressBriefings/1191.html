EDT</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon.\xc2\xa0 I apologize for the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re running a little late here today.\xc2\xa0 Before I get started, I\xe2\x80\x99d just like to give you a short update on the response to the situation in Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The United States is continuing to do everything in its power to help Japan and American citizens who were there at the time of these tragic events.\xc2\xa0 USAID is coordinating the overall U.S. government efforts in support of the Japanese government\xe2\x80\x99s response, and we are currently directing individuals to <a href="http://www.usaid.gov">www.usaid.gov</a> for information about response donations.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President is being kept up to date and is constantly being briefed by his national security staff.\xc2\xa0 The national security staff in the White House is also coordinating a large interagency response with experts meeting around the clock to monitor the latest information coming out of Japan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have offered our Japanese friends disaster response experts, search and rescue teams, technical advisors with nuclear expertise, and logistical support from the United States military.\xc2\xa0 Secretary Chu announced earlier today that the Department of Energy has offered and Japan has accepted an aerial measuring system capability, including detectors and analytical equipment used to provide assessments of contamination on the ground.\xc2\xa0 In total, the DOE team includes 34 people.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To support our citizens in Japan, the embassy is working around the clock.\xc2\xa0 We have our consular services available 24 hours a day to determine the whereabouts and well-being of all U.S. citizens in Japan.\xc2\xa0 A short while ago the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the State Department each issued an update on the ongoing situation at the nuclear plant in question in Japan.\xc2\xa0 The guidance, once again, was that after careful analysis of data, radiation levels and damage assessments to all units at the plant, our independent experts at the NRC are in agreement with the response and measures taken by Japanese technicians, including their recommended 20-kilometer radius for evacuation and additional shelter-in-place recommendations out to 30 kilometers.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Both the NRC and the State Department are continuing to ask American citizens in Japan to listen to the local Japanese officials for the very latest information regarding the situation there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With that, I will take your questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know you just said that you\xe2\x80\x99re urging Americans in Japan to listen to the local officials there.\xc2\xa0 We are starting to see, though, some other governments -- China, France, Austria -- taking steps to either urge their citizens or recommend their citizens leave Tokyo.\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. feel like its citizens in Tokyo are safe at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The assessment that I just mentioned made by the NRC is that the actions and recommendations taken by the Japanese government are the same that we would take in the situation and therefore they support and are recommending to American citizens that they listen to and follow the instructions of the Japanese government or local Japanese officials.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So taking into account all of the possible options that could happen at this point, there\xe2\x80\x99s no recommendation that U.S. citizens leave Tokyo at this point?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There is not that I\xe2\x80\x99m aware of.\xc2\xa0 I refer you -- obviously the State Department issues those kinds of advisories, but again, I would refer you to what the NRC has just put out.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Given that the situation at this plant took a turn for the worse overnight, do your comments from yesterday that there is no threat to Hawaii or the West Coast of the U.S. -- do those comments still stand?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, as you know, those comments were not mine, because I\xe2\x80\x99m not the expert, but the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is an independent agency charged specifically with safety regarding our nuclear industry.\xc2\xa0 And he -- Chairman Jaczko made clear that he believes based on his analysis and the NRC\xe2\x80\x99s analysis that there is no threat posed by --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Actually he said \xe2\x80\x9chighly unlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say no.\xc2\xa0 They later sent out --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me actually -- I have language precisely what he said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cYou aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to have any radiological material that, by the time it traveled those large distances, could present any risk to the American public.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a quote from yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I will defer to him as he is the expert on this.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But as far as you know, that comment stands, even given the developments overnight?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I think the NRC has put out additional information today, but on that issue, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Tricia.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On Bahrain, yesterday you said the Saudi troops are not an invasion.\xc2\xa0 But does the U.S. welcome them there and do you think it will help stabilize the kingdom?\xc2\xa0 And are you worried that it could inflame tensions and have an effect on oil prices?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Tricia, we -- first of all, the GCC troops were obviously invited by the Bahraini government.\xc2\xa0 However, we have made clear that we believe that there is no military solution to the unrest in Bahrain or in other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 And we urge the parties involved here and the governments involved to engage in the political dialogue that is necessary to respond to the grievances and the desires of the people of Bahrain.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s a call that we make to other governments in the region as well.\xc2\xa0 We have maintained that position consistently as we have seen unrest affect different countries throughout the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And on Libya, given that the rebels seem to be finished or coming near being finished, does the U.S. have any regrets about not doing more sooner?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Tricia, I would say first of all that Secretary Clinton, as you know, met with the Libyan opposition in Paris, as well as our European and Arab partners, to discuss the best way to continue to raise pressure on the Qaddafi regime and ways of supporting the Libyan opposition.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that today, later this afternoon, the President will be meeting with his national security team to discuss the situation in Libya, and that we continue to be focused on ways to increase the pressure on Qaddafi, increasing our support for the Libyan people and working with the international community to stop the violence there.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in terms of the speed of our response, I would simply say that it is -- we have acted with the utmost urgency.\xc2\xa0 We have taken dramatic action, together with our international partners, to put pressure on Muammar Qaddafi and his regime.\xc2\xa0 And obviously, as you know, the President has called on him to give up power.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We continue to review a variety of options that can be taken, that might be taken, together with our international partners, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0 But it, again, has been four weeks, if that, since this began, and the actions that the United States and the international -- its international partners have taken have been quite swift and unprecedented, in many ways, in terms of the nature and range of the actions.\xc2\xa0 And again, we continue to look at other options.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jill.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, following up on exactly that question, though, there is the feeling that the tide may have turned, that the opposition is now fleeing, they are under attack, and that they can\xe2\x80\x99t pull it together.\xc2\xa0 There are others who are saying it\xe2\x80\x99s too late for a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 Does the administration share that view?\xc2\xa0 I mean, is it over for the opposition?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a military assessment to make for you.\xc2\xa0 I would say, again, that the Secretary of State met with the Libyan opposition yesterday.\xc2\xa0 They discussed forms of assistance, including humanitarian assistance.\xc2\xa0 She also has mentioned, I believe, and has said this, that we are exploring authorities to free up some of the seized regime assets, the 32 plus billion dollars that have been seized, to provide financial support to the opposition.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So this is another indication of the constant exploration of different options that we have to increase the pressure on the Qaddafi regime as we go forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And just one on Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 Is there any indication that the U.S. has -- that Iran now actively is participating or just simply exploiting this situation undergoing -- underway in Bahrain?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jill, what I would say is that we believe that the situation in Bahrain needs to be resolved by the Bahraini people and the Bahraini government.\xc2\xa0 We continue to urge all sides to refrain from violence and the use of force in any way; to respect the universal rights of the people in that country -- the right to free speech, the right to freedom of assembly, access to information; and to address the grievance that they have, their demands for greater participation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And it is the broader point that we feel that the President has made since his speech in Cairo in 2009 that it is precisely to prevent ongoing unrest in the region -- or it will be one of the positive effects of having a dialogue, broadening your political participation of the people in these countries, addressing the grievances, responding in a non-violent way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One of the effects of taking that approach will be to reduce the amount of unrest in the future, because there is no -- suppression is not an answer in the long run to the problems in the region that have led to the unrest that has affected so many countries so far.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Right, but the question was about Iran trying to exploit this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously believe that this has to be dealt with by the Bahrainis in Bahrain.\xc2\xa0 And I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you on Iran, but we believe that it is -- it began with protests by the Bahrainis, and we have encouraged the Bahrain government to engage in a dialogue -- we have encouraged actually both sides to engage in a dialogue, moderates on both sides who want to pursue that.\xc2\xa0 And we continue to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jake.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How satisfied is President Obama with the information coming from Japanese authorities?\xc2\xa0 Does the U.S. government, does the White House feel that you are getting all the information when it -- as soon as the Japanese officials know it?\xc2\xa0 I say this because on Friday President Obama, when I asked him about the nuclear threat in Japan, offered reassuring words, I could say, as conveyed from the Prime Minister.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, the situation seems a little more dire today.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can point you to, Jake, is the statement that the NRC has put out.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s -- you have to remember that the NRC has its own independent experts on the ground there making assessments about the situation in Japan, determinations about advice that American citizens in Japan should follow.\xc2\xa0 And we have an overall team, the number of which I gave you, on the ground there that is making its own assessments and working very closely with Japanese officials to make those assessments.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But that -- I appreciate the fact that we have our own independent experts there, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the question.\xc2\xa0 The question is how comfortable is the President with -- that the information the Japanese are giving to the U.S. from Prime Minister Kan to him and below is accurate and not just best-case scenarios and hopes and wishes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, Jake, I would point you to the fact that we have a certain amount of expertise in this area.\xc2\xa0 We have people on the ground there.\xc2\xa0 We are working with Japanese officials who are providing us information, and we are making our independent assessments with our own experts, as well as consulting with the Japanese.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I just want to point to you right now, our focus is on helping the Japanese, helping our good friends and allies deal with this terrible tragedy that they\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered -- the combination of an earthquake, a tsunami, and now the nuclear reactor problem that they have.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So we are obviously, in the ways that I mentioned at the top, coordinating very closely with the Japanese and offering assistance that\xe2\x80\x99s being accepted; our expertise that they can tap when they need it; and giving advice when it\xe2\x80\x99s solicited.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a great deal of coordination, and right now our focus obviously is on American citizens in the country, and those assessments are being made, and then also focus very closely on what we can do to help Japan deal with this series of really tragic events.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are our independent experts there at least in part because we don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the assessments being made by the Japanese?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, Jake, they\xe2\x80\x99re there because we are a close ally and friend to Japan, and we are coordinating with the Japanese to assist them in any way that we can and in any way that they request in dealing with this terrible tragedy and historic tragedy.\xc2\xa0 We are obviously, because we have expertise in this area, making independent assessments, and using them to evaluate decisions we make about advising American citizens in Japan and obviously about advising Americans on American soil about any impact they may face because of this, which is what Chairman Jaczko was talking about yesterday.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So just to button it -- the President is satisfied with the information he\xe2\x80\x99s been getting from the Japanese government?\xc2\xa0 Yes?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have no reason to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s not, Jake.\xc2\xa0 The coordination is deep in many ways.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you for details on how that works and who\xe2\x80\x99s talking to whom to the NRC, the Department of Energy, the State Department, and the Embassy in Tokyo.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, one other thing.\xc2\xa0 The six youth groups who are part of the Egyptian revolution snubbed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who wanted to meet with them, who invited them to meet with her.\xc2\xa0 They said that they would not meet with her based on her negative position from the beginning of the revolution in Egypt and the position of the U.S. administration.\xc2\xa0 Did they misunderstand our position?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jake, I\xe2\x80\x99ll refer you to the State Department on that specifically.\xc2\xa0 I believe --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 They have no comment.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would just say that we have said from the beginning of the situation in Egypt and the beginning even prior to that of the unrest in the region that this is not and should not be about the United States of America.\xc2\xa0 We have operated under the principles that the President laid out in his speech in Cairo, and we believe that sticking to those principles was an important thing to do during the course of those historic days earlier this year during the events in Egypt.\xc2\xa0 And we are working closely with our allies in Egypt and offering assistance where we can and advice where we can as they go through this transitional process that is really remarkable, given where they were just a few months ago.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As for the specific comments that those groups made, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have -- I do not have a response.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Chip.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, could you clarify -- Secretary Chu -- and I\xe2\x80\x99m not asking you to be a brilliant scientist here -- but he said two things that seemed a bit in contradiction.\xc2\xa0 First of all, he said that the reactors in the U.S. are designed above what would be required to withstand a worst-case earthquake scenario.\xc2\xa0 But he also said that the United States can learn from this to strengthen and -- strengthen the safety at its 104 reactors.\xc2\xa0 So why do you need to strengthen the safety of the reactors if they\xe2\x80\x99re all designed above a worst-case scenario?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think as Chairman Jaczko made clear from this podium yesterday, that independent agency exists in order to ensure that the highest safety standards are met by the nuclear reactors that are part of the energy industry in this country.\xc2\xa0 And it is -- part of their procedure is to constantly review information and data that comes in, to review incidents that happen around the world.\xc2\xa0 I believe Chairman Jaczko even mentioned that they\xe2\x80\x99d performed a review of safety measures in the wake of the tsunami in Indonesia and made evaluations based on that in terms of the safety and security of our facilities here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So it simply stands to reason that you make models for various scenarios and every time there is new information that comes in from an actual event you take that data and you analyze it and you examine whether or not it affects the models you have for safety and security of your facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To suggest that everything is static forever obviously would be wrong, because there obviously -- there\xe2\x80\x99s new information to be gleaned from incidents.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99s what Secretary Chu, a far wiser man than I, was talking about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On no-fly zone, what exactly is the U.S. -- the administration\xe2\x80\x99s position before the Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our position, Chip, remains that we are evaluating a number of options, military options, including --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But a decision has to be made now.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- including a no-fly zone.\xc2\xa0 We feel that it is important that any action like that that might be taken should be done in concert with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 Through the United Nations would be our preferable vehicle for that, and therefore we would look to the U.N. as a forum for evaluating that option.\xc2\xa0 I think I mentioned yesterday that today is the deadline for the no-fly zone option to -- preparations or plans to be submitted in Brussels at NATO.\xc2\xa0 And I believe the NAC will review those tomorrow.\xc2\xa0 So this process is moving forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But our position is that action like that should be considered and taken if decided upon in coordination with our international partners, because it\xe2\x80\x99s very important in the way that we respond to a situation like we see in Libya, that it be international and not unilateral; that it include the support and participation, for example, of the Arab League and other organizations and countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And that is our sort of focus as we proceed with these conversations.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President satisfied to follow, not lead, on deciding whether to do it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I take issue with the characterization.\xc2\xa0 We think it is precisely because the President believes that the best outcome in a situation like we see in Libya, as we have seen in different forms in other countries in the region, that the best outcome will come when the action taken by countries -- third-party countries outside of the country where the unrest is happening -- be done in consensus with international partners, precisely so that it is not viewed by those who oppose positive democratic reform as the dictate of the West or the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be fair to say -- accurate to say the United States is still sitting on the fence on this?\xc2\xa0 Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to make a decision, yes or no?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Chip, you tell me if as an American citizen would you want your President not to consider all the implications and ramifications of taking military action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t there come a point to make a -- where you have to make a decision?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And I would go back to what I said to Jill, that we have acted with great haste, and we have coordinated international -- led and coordinated an international response, the likes of which the world has never seen in such a short period of time.\xc2\xa0 And we have -- we continue to consult with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 We meet -- we have met with, as the Secretary of State did, with the Libyan opposition discussing new ways we can put pressure on Qaddafi.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And when it comes to considering military options, this President will always be mindful of what the mission, should it be engaged, what it entails, the risks that it poses to our men and women in uniform, and its likelihood of having the kind of impact that we set out for it to have.\xc2\xa0 And that is his responsibility as Commander-in-Chief.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I would suggest to you that that is what leadership is all about.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Mike.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he worried about, though, the bureaucracy of making this decision with our allies, that by the time a decision is made the conflict may be over?\xc2\xa0 I mean, the rebels may have gone home.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We are obviously aware of the situation in Libya and the events and the fighting that\xe2\x80\x99s happening there.\xc2\xa0 Again, I do not believe that the American people would want the U.S. President to act unilaterally in a way to engage militarily without taking careful consideration of what the consequences of that would be; what the goals of the action would be; and being, as we have said from the beginning, very mindful of the fact that the desired result here will be best achieved if we act in concert with our international partners.\xc2\xa0 And that is the position he\xe2\x80\x99s taken, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the position he takes today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On nuclear energy in this country, Congressman Markey is calling for a moratorium on new reactors that could be built in seismically sensitive areas.\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe that\xe2\x80\x99s an overreaction?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think, Mike, as you know, we have a program, a loan-guarantee program at the Department of Energy.\xc2\xa0 I believe that\xe2\x80\x99s what some of the calls for a moratorium would address because those are -- that is the program through which potentially new reactors are being assisted through a loan-guarantee program that is conditional.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And right now we have one conditional loan commitment to one nuclear project, and there are several others that are under consideration.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a conditional loan agreement precisely because there are conditions attached, and one of those conditions is that any license would have to be granted by, of course, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the independent agency that ensures the safety and security of our nuclear reactors.\xc2\xa0 And they would not issue that license if they felt that a proposed plant were not safe and secure to operate in the United States.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So that is the process we follow.\xc2\xa0 The agency in question here, the NRC, as Chairman Jaczko said yesterday, focuses day to day, including prior to the events in Japan -- for days, weeks, months and years -- day to day on the safety and security of the nuclear facilities in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that would certainly apply going forward.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is the President worried about an overreaction here in Washington as you view the events in Japan when it comes to nuclear energy and how it may affect U.S. energy policy?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President sees what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Japan and feels, as most Americans do, a great -- he is -- I believe I heard him use the phrase today -- heartbroken by what he sees unfolding in Japan and the effect on the Japanese people.\xc2\xa0 He is, every day, concerned about the safety and security of the American people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He believes that our energy future will be best served by the approach that he\xe2\x80\x99s taking, which is to take an all-of-the-above approach in terms of our goals to reaching a clean energy standard, and that includes wind, solar, biofuels.\xc2\xa0 It includes responsible drilling in the deepwater areas that, even in the wake of the deep -- of the Gulf spill -- I think as I mentioned the other day, we have issued our first permit several weeks ago since the Gulf spill for deepwater drilling, then just several days ago issued the second permit.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we were able to do that because we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to responsible drilling because we need it for our energy demands, but we insist, in the wake of that spill, which demonstrated a weakness in our system and the dangers associated with that, with a terrible spill, that any industry that get a permit demonstrate that it can contain the kind of spill that we saw in the Gulf.\xc2\xa0 And those permits are now being issued to those industries that demonstrate that capacity.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, more broadly, I would just say that he is committed to a multidimensional or multisource approach to our energy needs in the future.\xc2\xa0 Nuclear is one of those sources.\xc2\xa0 And he believes that we need to proceed responsibly with the safety and security of the American people in mind, and if we do that, that nuclear can continue to be an element in our energy arsenal.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does the President believe implementing a no-fly zone is an act of war?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Chuck, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the terminology here, but he does believe it would be, in any situation, a serious action.\xc2\xa0 It is a military action.\xc2\xa0 And his concern -- again, I will go back to what I said -- is as he evaluates that option, which he has very clearly insisted be on the table for consideration and has driven the process to make sure that that option is evaluated and reviewed at NATO and now of course at the United Nations -- his preoccupation is, is this an option that can be effective?\xc2\xa0 Is it the right option?\xc2\xa0 What are the costs associated with it?\xc2\xa0 What are the risks associated with it?\xc2\xa0 And will it -- when I say the right option -- will it -- what confidence do we have that it will achieve the goals that we set if we were to implement it, because it is not a minor undertaking.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, I asked does he believe -- does the administration believe they need congressional approval?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The issue here, I believe, is about deciding what is the best option to take in concert with our international partners.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And you do not believe you need --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I have not heard any suggestion that there would be a --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no suggestion that you need a congressional resolution --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not that I have heard.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- any sort of -- on that?\xc2\xa0 On Japan, there is a pharmaceutical -- this run on potassium iodide that\xe2\x80\x99s taking place.\xc2\xa0 One of the pharmaceutical companies here in the United States that makes it, the oral solution, says that the national stockpile of this actually begins expiring in April of 2011.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any decision by the administration to look into that and make sure all of that is up to date, order more of it, if necessary, especially now that suddenly there\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a worldwide run on this right now?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me refer to HHS for specifics about the program and the stockpiling of that.\xc2\xa0 I would take this opportunity to remind you and the American people that this is an accident and a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Japan and not in the United States, and the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission made clear yesterday his belief, based on the NRC\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, that there are no harmful effects that can come from any radiation spillage -- that\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the word -- but radiation emissions that might come from the reactors that had been damaged in Japan; any harm that could come to Americans on American soil, because of the great distances involved here.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To follow up on Jake\xe2\x80\x99s question, every single independent nuclear expert that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked to seems to think that this is at such a catastrophic level that the Japanese -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity anymore to handle this on their own, that there needs to be a ton of international support.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Has the NRS -- has the NRC come to that same conclusion, that this is now beyond the scope of what the Japanese government can handle?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me refer you to the NRC for questions to the NRC.\xc2\xa0 But I would say that the NRC\xe2\x80\x99s role is tailored to its expertise.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Energy, as I mentioned, is very engaged in this and has experts also on the ground, and we are participating in international assistance to the Japanese to help them deal with this tragedy, both the --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But dealing with the nuclear reactor itself, that this is -- they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the capacity anymore --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the assessments of Japanese capacity except, of course, they do have a certain amount of expertise and -- a large amount of expertise.\xc2\xa0 Again, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you what I know based on talking to those experts including the one who heads the NRC.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 However, this is a huge event, and it requires the kind of concerted international response that we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing and which we are participating in a robust way.\xc2\xa0 Because Japan is a close friend and ally, and we will do everything we can to help them in this situation.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Very quickly to follow up on Chip\xe2\x80\x99s question which is this -- safety at our own nuclear plants.\xc2\xa0 Does the President not need to order a review of safety plans because they\xe2\x80\x99re constantly going on?\xc2\xa0 Is that what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to imply here?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to order a review because they\xe2\x80\x99re constantly going on.\xc2\xa0 He has, however -- I spoke with him about this within the last couple of hours -- asked, requested the NRC to evaluate the situation, the lessons learned from Japan as that information comes available and to incorporate it in its overall reviews of the safety and security of the reactors here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Now, as we learned from Chairman Jaczko yesterday, that is what they do in any case.\xc2\xa0 The President has added his voice, which is a singular and substantial voice, to the call for the need to do that today.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, Jonathan.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Follow-up on Chuck\xe2\x80\x99s point.\xc2\xa0 When the BP -- when Deepwater Horizon, when the President ordered a moratorium on new permitting while he did a review on response on that, in that case, there exactly was a planned incident response to a deepwater disaster.\xc2\xa0 In the case of nuclear meltdowns, there is no such thing.\xc2\xa0 There are seven different agencies, no clear lines of command.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I disagree with that, Jonathan.\xc2\xa0 I think that obviously there are a variety of incidents that could happen with a nuclear facility, including, as I believe Chairman Jaczko discussed, maybe Secretary Poneman discussed yesterday, the reviews that were done in the wake of 9/11 in terms of the security of our nuclear facilities and other potentially vulnerable facilities to terrorist attack.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That is one incident and would require a response by -- with a different lead, perhaps -- a different agency in response.\xc2\xa0 There could be the kind of meltdown, I guess, like occurred -- partial meltdown that occurred at Three Mile Island, and that would -- another agency might have the lead -- because they would have the expertise, so they would have the lead in responding to that.\xc2\xa0 And then you have the natural disaster possibility that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Japan.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We have very specific and detailed plans in how response would be coordinated and which agencies would take the lead.\xc2\xa0 Depending on what kind of incident we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing here, you would not -- there is not a one-size-fits-all response, we believe, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why we take the approach we take.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And in 2002, in the wake of 9/11, there was an amendment passed by Congress that ordered the distribution of potassium iodide to a 20-mile radius around all nuclear plants.\xc2\xa0 The Bush administration ignored it and Markey sent a letter to President Obama.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been ignored by the Obama administration as well.\xc2\xa0 Is there any effort to follow the law and begin distributing potassium iodide on a 20-mile radius?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Jonathan, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any information on that law or how the previous administration or this one has handled it.\xc2\xa0 I would just say that, again, this incident happened in Japan, not in the United States.\xc2\xa0 It is not in a place in the world where it could have harmful effects -- according to the independent NRC -- it could harmful effects on Americans, on American soil.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we -- the NRC has as its mission to constantly review the safety and security of the facilities we have here in the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Julianna.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 When you were speaking with the President earlier, was there any specific mention of reviewing older nuclear facilities, and that those should be an area that you might want to inspect in the wake of what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing in the aftermath?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Not in any conversation I had with him.\xc2\xa0 But I would just refer you to the NRC and the Department of Energy for this.\xc2\xa0 And again, the NRC is responsible for all the facilities and for the licensing and permitting the evaluations of their safety standards and the upgrade of their safety procedures if they so deem it necessary.\xc2\xa0 And again, it would be -- if the NRC decided that a facility was no longer safe, either because of something that had happened in that facility or because of new information, it has the authority to take the steps necessary to suspend activity at that facility or to shut it down.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So these procedures -- this agency is in place precisely for this reason, and the procedures are in place so that they can be followed if that contingency occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any response to what we saw in Germany earlier today where Chancellor Merkel has ordered the -- I think it was all pre-1980s plants to be shut down -- I think it was seven nuclear plants to be shut down, pending a review of their safety, until June?\xc2\xa0 Does the administration have any response to that, or did the President talk about that at all?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response to actions taken by other countries.\xc2\xa0 What we know and what we\xe2\x80\x99re responsible for is the safety and security of those facilities in the United States.\xc2\xa0 And that responsibility lies with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\xc2\xa0 They have made the judgment that our facilities are safe and secure.\xc2\xa0 They are constantly, as Chairman Jaczko said, evaluating their standards, their procedures, taking in new information, and making adjustments accordingly.\xc2\xa0 And that would apply to old reactors as well as newer ones.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann.\xc2\xa0 Ann, yes.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, thank you.\xc2\xa0 On no-fly, a clarification.\xc2\xa0 How does it work tomorrow when the North Atlantic Council considers this?\xc2\xa0 Has the United States already decided how it feels, or does your representative have to call back to Washington and say, here are the options?\xc2\xa0 And will any action by the -- or anything adopted by the NAC also require a green light from the Security Council?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you, as I mentioned, the President is having a meeting on Libya today in the White House with his national security team.\xc2\xa0 In terms of how the process of communicating what happens in Brussels takes place, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\xc2\xa0 This is not a, as far as I understand it, a decision moment where here\xe2\x80\x99s the option, sir, take it.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s -- they evaluate what\xe2\x80\x99s presented before them and then have discussions, and we move forward accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a timeframe on when a decision will be made.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And real quick.\xc2\xa0 Could it be a smaller no-fly zone?\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel that he could do something other than cover the entire country?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t -- I would just refer you on sort of the logistical aspects of it to NATO.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And who would pay for it?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen an option that would spell that out.\xc2\xa0 And it depends obviously --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You were asked in the non-broadcast briefing this morning about what might keep the President home from his foreign trip this weekend?\xc2\xa0 Are there elements either in Japan or Libya that might --<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ann, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on what could happen in the world we live in tomorrow or next week.\xc2\xa0 The fact is the President is taking this trip because he is committed to growing the economy, to rebalancing our national security posture to take into account the world as it has changed.\xc2\xa0 And he believes our relationships with Latin America are very important.\xc2\xa0 So he will continue with the trip.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And as you know -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve covered the White House for a long time -- our communications are very sophisticated.\xc2\xa0 He will travel with a great deal of staff.\xc2\xa0 I daresay they\xe2\x80\x99re a lot more sophisticated than they were back when you and I started covering this place.\xc2\xa0 So he remains confident that he can fully execute his job while on the road.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Abby.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to go back to the question of the Libyan no-fly zone and the role of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Senator Lugar yesterday suggested that not just that there must be a war declaration but that, as a courtesy, given the U.S. blood and treasure that might be at risk if a no-fly zone were implemented, that the President bring that decision to Congress so that they can have a chance to debate it and consult about it.\xc2\xa0 To what extent is that something that is a part of the discussion of a no-fly zone?\xc2\xa0 And does the President believe that Congress should have an opportunity to have that debate about whether we put soldiers and U.S. money on the line?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response, Abby, specifically to the role of Congress in this instance.\xc2\xa0 I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re getting ahead of ourselves -- you\xe2\x80\x99re asking what role would Congress have should the President decide that this option is one that the United States should pursue.\xc2\xa0 So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we wait and see as those steps are taken and that decision is made.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I remind you that this is not the only option that is on the table.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re reviewing options constantly, including the one that I mentioned the Secretary of State brought up yesterday with a Libyan opposition leader, which is how to -- exploring ways to take those seized assets or a portion of them to aid the opposition in Libya.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 April.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 What safety nets is the White House considering when it comes to trade for American companies who gain items from Japan like electronics, cars, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 What is the White House doing to the possible pinch for these American companies when it comes to trade with Japan?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 April, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xc2\xa0 Obviously this incident happened four days ago; I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that any procedures are in place.\xc2\xa0 I think that kind of question might be best addressed to the USTR.\xc2\xa0 But we can look into that for you if you want to check back.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Margaret.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 After the Libya briefing the President is getting today, are we going to get any kind of a substantive readout, do you expect, on --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll just put a mic in the room, and then you guys can -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Should we wait for anything, or not really?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything for you.\xc2\xa0 We obviously from here announced that the meeting is taking place, so we might have something to say about it.\xc2\xa0 But I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate a substantial announcement out of it.\xc2\xa0 If we -- if there is something to say then we\xe2\x80\x99ll put out a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and I had a last question --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Wild card.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Not really --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Wild card for -- (laughter) --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So, on education, should we read anything into the fact that every education visit the President has made in the last week or so has been to a swing state, and the three interviews he\xe2\x80\x99s doing today are in swing states?\xc2\xa0 Or is that a total coincidence and is there some other reason to explain --</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think the interviews he gave today to regional television had to do with -- at least something to do with the fact that there are things happening in those states regarding education reform.\xc2\xa0 And, look, we make decisions for a variety of reason about where he should visit and where he should -- to whom he should give interviews, so I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t read too much into that.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Education follow-up, Jay?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Let me go to Stephen.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What does it say about the state of U.S.-Saudi relations that they would stage this intervention in Bahrain without telling the U.S., given the fact that Secretary Gates was there, I guess, Friday, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very engaged in this whole issue about what Bahrain should do to reform and stop the violence?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, I would just say that we were aware of obviously the invitation by the Bahrain government for assistance from GCC countries.\xc2\xa0 And I would simply say that Saudi Arabia is an important partner of ours, as are other countries in the region.\xc2\xa0 Our position, however, remains that it is -- military response is not a solution to the problems Bahrain or other countries in the region; that the countries in the region have -- are experiencing the unrest that they are experiencing precisely because their populations are -- crave more participation in the political process.\xc2\xa0 They want more freedom, they want more economic possibilities, and they want to be heard.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And we support that.\xc2\xa0 We support the peaceful demonstrations in which the peoples of the region voice those demands, and we call on the governments in the region to respond to those demonstrations to meet peace with peace and then to begin a dialogue that will produce the kind of changes that in the long run will ensure that the countries in the region have brighter futures, that the people in the region have brighter futures, and that the likelihood of further unrest is diminished because the people are feeling that their government is listening to them and responding.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the experts in town that say that there\xe2\x80\x99s some tension between the U.S. and the Saudis over events in the Middle East, Bahrain -- are they incorrect?\xc2\xa0 Is that interpretation wrong?</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Stephen, I would just say that the message the President has delivered is not a message tailored for a specific country.\xc2\xa0 We understand that each country is different.\xc2\xa0 The circumstances are different.\xc2\xa0 The states of development can be different.\xc2\xa0 The government arrangements can be different.\xc2\xa0 But the sort of principles that he laid out pertain throughout the region.\xc2\xa0 And obviously we maintain close partnerships with some governments in the region, and it\xe2\x80\x99s precisely out of friendship that we are encouraging governments in the region who are our partners to pursue political dialogue and to respond to the legitimate aspirations and grievances of their people, because we believe therein lies the future, the positive future for countries in the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.</p>\n<p>\n\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 MR.
