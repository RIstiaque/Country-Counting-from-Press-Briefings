Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:54 P.M. EDT</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Good afternoon, everybody.\xc2\xa0 Nice to see you all.\xc2\xa0 Sorry to keep you waiting here a few minutes.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m joined today by a special guest, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, to talk about our week-long focus on making college more affordable for millions of Americans.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We kicked off this effort on Saturday when the President discussed in his weekly address our previous efforts to expand college access for students and families, and the importance of continuing to offer relief to both students and graduates still paying off their college loans.</p>\n<p>In about an hour, the President will host an event in the East Room where he\xe2\x80\x99ll use both his pen and his phone to take action to further lift the burden of crushing student loan debt.\xc2\xa0 He will announce a new package of executive actions and will sign a presidential memorandum that will make federal student loan repayments more affordable for nearly 5 million borrowers, including students, graduates, and their families.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll continue this focus tomorrow when the President will do a live Q&amp;A with Tumblr, answering questions directly from consumers across the country about this crucial issue.\xc2\xa0 I expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll have some new data for you about the impact of student debt and our executive actions ahead of that event tomorrow.</p>\n<p>At both of these events and throughout the week, the President will use every opportunity to urge Congress to do their part by passing the Senate Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 bill to help more young people save by refinancing their federal student loans.</p>\n<p>So I\xe2\x80\x99ll turn it over here to Secretary Duncan.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll do some short remarks on his own.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions about the President\xe2\x80\x99s student loan event later today, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll take your questions.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll wrap all this up right around 1:45 p.m. when the President himself is going to use his pen and his phone in the East Room.</p>\n<p>So with that, Secretary Duncan.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thank you, Josh, and good luck in this new job.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Thank you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Tough crowd here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t envy you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I appreciate you being here to help.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m here today because I continue to believe -- and, in fact, I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced -- that a college education is the single-most important investment that Americans can make to build a stronger future.\xc2\xa0 But while college has never been more important, unfortunately it\xe2\x80\x99s also never been more expensive.\xc2\xa0 I know that cost keeps too many students and their parents up at night, and probably some of you guys in this room are in that boat.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re unsure how they\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay for it and they feel burdened by their student loans, and some are wondering is it actually worth it.\xc2\xa0 And let me be clear -- it is absolutely worth it.</p>\n<p>Research continues to show the many, many benefits of higher education.\xc2\xa0 With some form of post-secondary education come higher earnings, lower risk of unemployment, and greater economic strength for our nation.\xc2\xa0 And when I talk about a college education, that means everything from a four-year degree to a two-year program to community college and trade, technical, or vocational training.\xc2\xa0 All of these institutions are key components of our dynamic and diverse higher education system.</p>\n<p>But for too many of our low- and middle-income families, hardworking families, the dream of going to college is slipping out of their reach as tuition continues to rise and more students than ever are relying on loans to pay for it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled to all 50 states, and everywhere I go I meet students and families who feel overwhelmed trying to repay student loans.\xc2\xa0 Even worse, I met parents and students in high school who desperately want to pursue some form of higher education but they feel that college is too expensive or they\xe2\x80\x99re scared to take out loans, worried about graduating with too much debt they cannot manage.\xc2\xa0 I tell a story of a while back when I in Iowa, after a town hall meeting a young girl came up to me -- she was a senior in high school -- was talking about what her family is going through.\xc2\xa0 Actually, she has a twin brother and she said at that time her parents were trying to decide which twin to send to college -- her or her brother.\xc2\xa0 That was the very real dinnertime conversation in their family.</p>\n<p>Those kinds of situations -- obviously we have to do better.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the economic strength of our families, our communities, or our nation as a whole.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Obama administration has made some significant progress in creating flexible repayment options for borrowers, like those that determine your monthly payment based upon how much you earn, and loan forgiveness after 10 years of public service.\xc2\xa0 And federal student loan programs come with a wealth of consumer protections.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re working to raise awareness about the steps that borrowers can take to responsibly manage their debt, but we know that more needs to be done.</p>\n<p>As part of his year of action and impact to expand opportunity for all Americans, President Obama is committed to building on these efforts to make student debt more affordable and manageable to repay.\xc2\xa0 The President has called on the Senate to pass legislation, allowing 25 million student loan borrowers to refinance outstanding student loans at lower interest rates.\xc2\xa0 This move could save the typical student as much as $2,000 over the life of their loan.\xc2\xa0 If you do that math -- 25 million borrowers, $2,000 each -- $50 billion.\xc2\xa0 Rather than paying back loans, think if that went into buying houses and buying cars and starting businesses.\xc2\xa0 Think what that would mean to our economy.</p>\n<p>And today, President Obama is taking further action by signing a new presidential memorandum, which directs our department, the Department of Education, to consider and develop proposed regulations that could allow an additional 5 million federal student loan borrowers to cap their monthly payments at 10 percent of their income.</p>\n<p>The President is also outlining a series of new executive actions aimed at ensuring that we are all doing what we can to support federal student loan borrowers, especially vulnerable borrowers who may be at greater risk of defaulting on their loans.\xc2\xa0 These actions range from strengthening the incentives for the loan services that we work with so they are encouraged to serve students well, collaborating with the private sector to spread the word about borrowers\xe2\x80\x99 options, and ensuring our active-duty military get the relief that they need and deserve, that they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to, on their federal student loans.</p>\n<p>College is absolutely worth it.\xc2\xa0 By every measure, college is worth it.\xc2\xa0 But we must do more to make college more affordable.\xc2\xa0 So today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is just one more step towards that goal, and we look forward to continuing to work on this issue as we move forward.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll stop there and take any questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Julie, want to start?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, two questions for you.\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s budget, I believe, puts the price tag for this student loan program expansion at $7.6 billion in its first year.\xc2\xa0 Can you tell us how you\xe2\x80\x99ll plan to pay for that?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So we actually don\xe2\x80\x99t know the costs yet.\xc2\xa0 Obviously, we have to go through this regulatory process, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out that on the back end.\xc2\xa0 But we think this is something that would be fantastic for the economy.\xc2\xa0 And again, the benefits of having people -- rather than paying back loans -- buying homes, buying cars, investing, starting businesses -- there are huge benefits there.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99ll work through the details as we go through the regulatory process.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 And on Common Core, there are governors in three states that have signed legislation basically opting their states out of the Common Core standards.\xc2\xa0 Is the administration looking to do anything to try to keep other states from following that example?\xc2\xa0 And could states that do opt out lose federal education funds?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So to be very, very clear -- and you guys can help to clear this up -- what we have always been about is high standards and college- and career-ready standards.\xc2\xa0 And what we\xe2\x80\x99re reacting to, as you guys may remember under No Child Left Behind, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the intent, but we had about 20 states actually dummy down their standards to make politicians look good.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s bad for kids, it\xe2\x80\x99s bad for the country, it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible for education.\xc2\xa0 But we need to have high international benchmark college- and career-ready standards.\xc2\xa0 And so whether common or not, that\xe2\x80\x99s less the issue; it\xe2\x80\x99s more having high standards.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The Oklahoma example is a pretty interesting one.\xc2\xa0 Just to give you a couple facts -- and I think sadly, this is not about education; this is about politics.\xc2\xa0 So in Oklahoma, about 40 percent of high school graduates -- these are not the dropouts -- 40 percent of high school graduates have to take remedial classes when they go to college.\xc2\xa0 Why?\xc2\xa0 Because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready -- 40 percent.\xc2\xa0 About 25 percent of Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s eighth-graders in math are proficient -- 25 percent.\xc2\xa0 And other states locally are out-educating Oklahoma.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And if you go back to just a couple of months ago, this is what Governor Fallin said about higher standards -- I\xe2\x80\x99m quoting her -- she said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe standards\xe2\x80\x9d -- and I quote -- \xe2\x80\x9coutline what students need to be college- and career-ready.\xc2\xa0 I want to be really clear\xe2\x80\x9d -- this is Governor Fallin -- \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be really clear:\xc2\xa0 Common Core is not a federal program.\xc2\xa0 It is driven and implemented by those states who choose to participate.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also not a federal curriculum.\xc2\xa0 In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a curriculum at all.\xc2\xa0 Local educators and school districts will still design the best lesson plans and choose appropriate textbooks, and will drive classroom learning.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>So what changed?\xc2\xa0 Politics changed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Governor Fallin has also said signing this legislation, said that there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that her state could lose federal funding.\xc2\xa0 Is that a realistic possibility?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So, again, we are partnering with folks who have high standards.\xc2\xa0 If people want to dummy down standards, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very different thing.\xc2\xa0 We partner with states whether they\'re in Common Core or have their own high standards.\xc2\xa0 But where we will challenge status quo is when states dummy down standards.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, is that a yes, that states that pull out and don\'t have a similar set of standards could lose federal funding?</p>\n<p>SECRETRARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 If they do not have high -- again, I\xe2\x80\x99m repeating myself.\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re asking is that standards be high -- college- and career-ready -- not certified by us, but certified by the local institutions of higher education.\xc2\xa0 And what we want to make sure is that our high school graduates -- we got a dropout problem we got to deal with.\xc2\xa0 We want to make sure our high school graduates aren\xe2\x80\x99t having to take remedial classes, burn up Pell grants, burn up student loans taking non-credit bearing.\xc2\xa0 And right now, roughly 40 percent of those graduates in Oklahoma are having to do that.\xc2\xa0 We don\'t think that\'s good for those young people, their families, or for the country.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what do you say to critics who say that changes to the structure of student loans are responsible for creating the bubble that has created this wave of indebtedness?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just simply not true.\xc2\xa0 And again, we need to all work together.\xc2\xa0 This is not about pointing fingers and laying blame.\xc2\xa0 This is about mutual responsibility, mutual accountability.\xc2\xa0 We want to continue to invest at the federal level.\xc2\xa0 So one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99m most proud from the first term was $40 billion in additional Pell grants without going back to taxpayers for a nickel, and simply stop subsidizing banks and put all that money into grants.\xc2\xa0 That was wildly controversial in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We thought it was common sense.\xc2\xa0 We went from about 6 million Pell recipients to about 9 million.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We want to continue to play -- obviously, what we have done, what the President is proposing this week, we want to continue to try and reduce that debt burden.\xc2\xa0 But we can\'t do it alone.\xc2\xa0 States have to invest.\xc2\xa0 And when states stop investing, what many universities do, they jack up their tuition.\xc2\xa0 And universities have to do a better job of keeping down their tuition and focusing not just on access but around the completion.\xc2\xa0 So all of us have to work together in this effort and do the right thing.</p>\n<p>I have to say, everywhere I travel -- and you guys do the same thing -- airplanes, wherever I am, the cost of college for hardworking Americans is a huge, huge challenge.\xc2\xa0 And it worries the President, it worries the Vice President, and it worries me.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mara.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I have two questions.\xc2\xa0 Can you give us an update on your department\xe2\x80\x99s report card on colleges that was supposed to show the value of college?\xc2\xa0 Where does that stand?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re still working it through, and we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to have that -- was it December \xe2\x80\x9815, Dori?\xc2\xa0 Is that right?\xc2\xa0 School year \xe2\x80\x9915-\xe2\x80\x9916.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then after you do that, then you\xe2\x80\x99ll ask Congress to peg federal funds to do that?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, going forward.\xc2\xa0 And again, just having -- again, this has been controversial and will be controversial.\xc2\xa0 But as a nation, we put out $150 billion in grants and loans each year.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all of us -- taxpayer money going out.\xc2\xa0 Basically zero of that, very little of that goes to outcomes.\xc2\xa0 That\'s all based upon inputs.\xc2\xa0 Just getting families basic information transparency:\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s a grant?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s a loan?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s not the one-year cost, what\xe2\x80\x99s the four-year cost?\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the graduation rate of the college I\xe2\x80\x99m going to?\xc2\xa0 Basic stuff that we want to get out.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So having transparency and ultimately having money go to places that are serious about this.\xc2\xa0 One quick positive example -- I did the commencement address at Arizona State a couple weeks ago.\xc2\xa0 The President there, President Crow, has done an amazing job over the past six, eight years of increasing graduation rates, increasing access.\xc2\xa0 Record numbers of Hispanic and African American and Native American young people going.\xc2\xa0 He is building a culture of excellence around inclusion rather than exclusion and helping many first-generation college-goers go.\xc2\xa0 And he is keeping costs down in a pretty interesting way.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And just one other question.\xc2\xa0 Just what are, like, the one or two most important reasons that college costs have escalated so much faster than anything else, the cost of anything else?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Great question.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s one or two.\xc2\xa0 The state disinvestment in tough economic times was not helpful, and, again, challenging universities to do a better job of containing costs.\xc2\xa0 And for me, again, this is not about cost, it\xe2\x80\x99s about value -- making sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about access but graduation.\xc2\xa0 The goal is not to go to college; the goal is to get that degree.\xc2\xa0 Some universities do a better job of that than others.\xc2\xa0 Again, a positive example -- places like the University of Maryland system -- they\xe2\x80\x99re using technology in those intro classes to drive down costs and they\xe2\x80\x99re increasing completion rates.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of innovation that we want to incentivize.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So other than state disinvestment, there has to be something else.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 State disinvestment and universities not doing a great job of containing costs, those two.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Chuck.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, what\xe2\x80\x99s the legal rationale for what the President is doing today?\xc2\xa0 And if you had this rationale, why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it done four years ago?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ve done this in the past.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve sort of taken this in a couple different steps.\xc2\xa0 As we go back into 2010, we did this for future students going forward.\xc2\xa0 We came back in 2011 and did it for current students.\xc2\xa0 What the President is proposing, asking us to work on, is this is going back to folks who borrowed before 2007.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s a big --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back until when?\xc2\xa0 How long?\xc2\xa0 In perpetuity?\xc2\xa0 They have a student loan, they all get to be a part of it?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 So in the past couple of years we\xe2\x80\x99ve done future students, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done current students, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take a step back to help those who are borrowers or --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How do you pay for something like this in an executive action without getting Congress to codify it?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ll work that through as we go forward, and don\xe2\x80\x99t know the cost yet.\xc2\xa0 But we just think for the economy this is such an important thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you\xe2\x80\x99re confident this is constitutional?\xc2\xa0 This is legal for you guys to do it?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a constitutional scholar, but --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, I understand, but you guys -- you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten legal advice to say you can do this above and beyond?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Yes, we have.\xc2\xa0 And, again, we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it in the past just to be very clear.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just because you\xe2\x80\x99ve done it in the past, maybe nobody challenged it.\xc2\xa0 But if somebody challenges this, you feel like --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to have folks look at it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, on the 2010 and the 10 percent cap, how many students are taking advantage of that now?\xc2\xa0 And has there been any studies, research showing that this is doing what it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to do?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact numbers, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get that for you.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s still early on, obviously, and this is just an option.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not right for every student.\xc2\xa0 We don\xe2\x80\x99t think every student needs to do this or wants to do this, but having it as an option we think is really important.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of the events today focusing on the burden of students\xe2\x80\x99 loans, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if --</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Sorry, could you speak up a little bit?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In light of the events today focusing on the burden of students\xe2\x80\x99 loans, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if there\xe2\x80\x99s any regret in the administration about not backing Senator Warren\xe2\x80\x99s bill from last year that would have tied student loan rates to the loan rates given to big banks.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details of that one, but again, going forward I think we have a real opportunity to break through.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely supporting her bill.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re doing a series of executive actions ourselves.\xc2\xa0 And again, this is something I think we all have to think about when you have a trillion dollars in debt out there -- what do we do to relieve some of that burden; what do we do to help young people afford going to college.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s been lots of focus on the cost of debt, which is very important.\xc2\xa0 We also want to focus on the amount of debt itself.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Peter.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On another issue -- I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering, as an athlete yourself, what you think about the NCAA issues that are being so hotly debated right now.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a really informed opinion.\xc2\xa0 I followed it not as closely as maybe I should.\xc2\xa0 These are really complex issues.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a longer conversation.\xc2\xa0 I do think student athletes, again, should not just be going to the institution to make millions of dollars for the institution and have no degree to show for it.\xc2\xa0 And I grew up playing with a lot of basketball players back home on the South Side of Chicago who did exactly that -- didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite make the NBA, came home, had nothing to show for it and had very tough lives.\xc2\xa0 And that was something that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of indelibly marked from my experience.</p>\n<p>So making sure young people have a chance -- yes, to play, but to be students first, athletes second, and holding universities accountable for that; having them have the chance to come back and earn their diploma at some point if they need to do that; and looking at sort of their long-term medical needs or whatever -- I think there\xe2\x80\x99s some commonsense middle ground that folks can and should get to.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To what extent do you think they\xe2\x80\x99re being taken advantage of with their images being sold and that sort of thing?</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, so, again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know all the details there.\xc2\xa0 But where I challenge universities and challenge university presidents and athletic directors and coaches, to your point, where they\xe2\x80\x99re being used to generate revenue for the coach and his salary; where they\xe2\x80\x99re being used to generate revenue for the university, and no sense is given to the importance of their academic success -- it is absolutely using, and I would say abusing those young men and women.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the most important thing -- if they can get that college degree, that changes their life forever.\xc2\xa0 We know a tiny, tiny percent -- make a nickel professionally.\xc2\xa0 They get that college degree -- this is what we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about today -- they have this huge opportunity in front of them.\xc2\xa0 If they don\xe2\x80\x99t have that, if they compete for a couple years and go back to the streets with nothing, they have absolutely been used and that\xe2\x80\x99s not acceptable.</p>\n<p>A quick thing you may know -- we challenged the NCAA a couple years ago to raise college graduation rates in order to compete in the NCAA.\xc2\xa0 We got that through -- were very good about that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Final thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll say is, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting the vast majority of coaches\xe2\x80\x99 contracts -- Tom McMillen, who\xe2\x80\x99s a Rhodes Scholar, has done some work on this -- coaches\xe2\x80\x99 contracts, the overall majority of their incentives are tied to wins and losses; very little is tied to academic performance.\xc2\xa0 So the structure of this is backwards, and we\xe2\x80\x99d love to see more coaches\xe2\x80\x99 contracts -- to get any bonus, their student athletes would have to meet a minimum academic success level.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 April, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the last one, and then the Secretary has got to go.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Secretary Duncan, is there a crisis when it comes to minorities getting student loans in this nation?\xc2\xa0 If so, tell us why; if not, tell us why.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Well, again, young people have access to loans, and we want to make sure we can increase not just loans, but Pell grants.\xc2\xa0 And I talked about that.\xc2\xa0 The challenge is in helping more young people and their families pay back these loans.\xc2\xa0 And if we can mitigate the costs, the interest rates on the back end, we can have more young people -- rather than paying back loans -- buying houses, buying cars, starting businesses, becoming entrepreneurs.\xc2\xa0 We think that\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And did you work out the issue with the parent PLUS loan program that you were --\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been going through negotiated rulemaking, so we\xe2\x80\x99re still working on that.\xc2\xa0 But that team has done some very, very good work together.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time today.</p>\n<p>SECRETARY DUNCAN:\xc2\xa0 Thanks, guys.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 All right, I have two quick things unrelated today to today\xe2\x80\x99s student loan announcement that I\xe2\x80\x99ll do here at the top, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go to your questions.</p>\n<p>The first is that earlier today, Governor Shumlin of Vermont signed legislation increasing that state\xe2\x80\x99s minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 The President commends the Governor, as well as the state legislature, for giving their state\xe2\x80\x99s workers the raise they deserve.\xc2\xa0 Governor Shumlin was among the New England governors who appeared with the President earlier this year in Connecticut to call for an increase in the federal minimum wage.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President again calls on Congress to follow the lead of the large and growing coalition of states, cities, counties and businesses that have done the right thing for their citizens and their employees.\xc2\xa0 Only Congress can get the job done for the whole country, lifting wages for 28 million Americans.\xc2\xa0 The President will continue working with Congress to get this done and ensure that no American who works full-time has to raise a family in poverty, and that every American who works hard has the opportunity to succeed.</p>\n<p>Secondly, and not completely unrelated to that, I wanted to note that today, here at the White House, we\xe2\x80\x99re hosting an event to explore the state of working dads, including the challenges dads face balancing career and family, and how he can better support the needs of both businesses and working families.\xc2\xa0 This discussion, as many of you know, is part of a series of events we have been doing leading up to our White House Summit on Working Families that\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled for June 23rd.\xc2\xa0 The President, the Vice President, the First Lady and Dr. Biden will all participate in that summit.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99ll be there alongside business leaders, labor leaders, economists, policymakers, advocates and workers who are directly facing these challenges -- which I know includes not an insignificant number of people in this room, as well.</p>\n<p>We know that workplaces that make full use of the talented pool of American workers are essential to a thriving and healthy economy, to enabling businesses to stay competitive in today\xe2\x80\x99s global economy, and helping all workers ensure the economic stability of their families.\xc2\xa0 The summit, as I mentioned, is June 23rd.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s two weeks from today.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re excited as we continue to build some momentum in advance of that event.</p>\n<p>So, as you can tell, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going on here today, including the conclusion of a trip to Europe last week.</p>\n<p>So with that, why don\xe2\x80\x99t we go to some questions.\xc2\xa0 Julie, I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you the first shot here.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 I just had one on the VA audit that\xe2\x80\x99s out today -- again, pretty scathing.\xc2\xa0 Over 57,000 new patients are awaiting appointments at VA hospitals and clinics.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering both how this was allowed to get to this point, and while these studies and reviews are going on, if anything is being done to help these 57,000 patients actually get appointments.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there have been a number of things.\xc2\xa0 The first thing I want to point out -- that the release of today\xe2\x80\x99s data is an indication of the President\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to trying to be transparent about this process; that the data that has been released will be helpful in giving all of us -- both folks inside the administration, as well as individuals on Capitol Hill, as well as members of the public and in the media -- to take a look at exactly what the scope of this problem is.\xc2\xa0 And being able to review this data should help us not just decide on the scope, or determine the scope of this problem, but also to evaluate proposed reforms that the President is committed to.</p>\n<p>This continues to be a priority, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to put in place the kinds of reforms that will ensure that we achieve the goal that we all share, which is making sure that every single veteran has access to the health care and to the VA benefits that they deserve.</p>\n<p>Now, in terms of your specific question about what exactly has been done, the VA has been working to provide care to veterans and has taken steps at the national and local levels to ensure timely access to care.\xc2\xa0 One example of this is that in Phoenix the VA has reached out to all the veterans that had been identified by the Office of Inspector General awaiting appointments, who are not currently in the system, to discuss their individual medical needs and immediately begin scheduling appointments.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>One of the things that they have done to try to expand the capacity of the VA to provide these services is to deploy mobile medical centers so they can provide greater medical services and medical services more quickly to those who have been waiting on them for too long.\xc2\xa0 There also has been an effort to hire some new staff and to put human resources employees in place so that they can more quickly onboard additional staff.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There have also been some management things that have been put in place -- for example, suspending some performance awards for senior executives at the VHA, and other things.\xc2\xa0 I mention that only because it\xe2\x80\x99s also a topic of some discussion on Capitol Hill, and there are some steps that we\xe2\x80\x99ve already taken proactively as an administration to address some of the management challenges that are associated with this, as well.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a very large number of people -- 57,000 people -- but the situation in Phoenix has seemed to have gotten a lot of attention, but I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if some of the other people on these lists who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to get appointments can expect the same kind of outreach that the patients in Phoenix who have been waiting have gotten.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what\xe2\x80\x99s important about the study that was done in Phoenix is it does highlight some of the significant challenges that the VHA is facing right now.\xc2\xa0 And what we have learned as we have investigated further is that these problems aren\xe2\x80\x99t just centralized in Phoenix; that there are problems at other facilities.\xc2\xa0 And part of what Rob Nabors, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Chief of Staff, who is working over at the VA right now, is trying to assess is to get a sense of what the scope of these problems is and to propose some reforms that would address not just the challenges that we identified in Phoenix, but some of the challenges that may also exist at some of the other facilities across the country.</p>\n<p>This is a large task.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no sugarcoating that.\xc2\xa0 But it is a task that the President has never been more dedicated to.</p>\n<p>Mark.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 How important is naming a new Secretary of Veterans Affairs to this process?\xc2\xa0 And how soon do you have to do that to really get this reform off the ground?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Clearly, having some new leadership at the VA is a top priority.\xc2\xa0 And whoever has this responsibility will have a very important job, and it is a priority of this administration to get someone in place soon.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we need to make sure that we have the right person for the job.\xc2\xa0 And so this is a \xe2\x80\x9cwhile we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move expeditiously, we\xe2\x80\x99re not going to rush through this process\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0 We need to make sure that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to choose an individual that has the kind of experience and r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 that\'s needed for a task that is this large.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And back to Julie\xe2\x80\x99s question.\xc2\xa0 Today\xe2\x80\x99s audit talks about how widespread these problems were not just in Phoenix, as you mentioned, but elsewhere in the country.\xc2\xa0 Does this report provide any additional impetus to expand the effort that you\xe2\x80\x99re making in Phoenix to other areas?\xc2\xa0 And if so, where are you locating them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the VA in terms of what specific steps they\'re taking beyond what I\xe2\x80\x99ve already mentioned here in response to this data release.\xc2\xa0 Generally speaking, I can tell you that it is evident that there are problems in locations outside of just the Phoenix facility -- the VA facility in Phoenix.</p>\n<p>And what the President is committed to doing is making sure that we put in place the kinds of reforms that will ensure that benefits all across the -- that veterans all across the country have access to the kinds of benefits that the President certainly believes they should have.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And can I ask on the attack at the airport in Karachi by the Taliban, does this indicate any resurgence of the Taliban as a force?\xc2\xa0 And is it a sign that efforts to engage the Taliban in peace talks have failed in that country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me just start by saying, Mark, that the United States condemns the attack on the Karachi airport.\xc2\xa0 And our hearts go out to the victims -- or to the families of the victims and those who were wounded in that attack.</p>\n<p>In terms of who was responsible for that attack, I\xe2\x80\x99d direct you to the government of Pakistan for that assessment.\xc2\xa0 And in terms of negotiations, that is a decision -- a strategic decision that will have to be made by the government of Pakistan.\xc2\xa0 And I don\'t have anything to say about it.</p>\n<p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s move around here a little bit.\xc2\xa0 Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, a couple weeks back the House voted to pass a bill that would prevent the Department of Justice and the DEA from enforcing the law against medical marijuana facilities provided that they are state-licensed.\xc2\xa0 Does the White House have a position on that yet?\xc2\xa0 I know that as of now the White House is still opposed to medical marijuana, but 170 House Democrats voted for that.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll confess, Steve, I\xe2\x80\x99m not familiar with that specific piece of legislation.\xc2\xa0 I do suspect that my colleagues at the Department of Justice may be able to give you some insight into what our position is on that piece of legislation and what impact it would have on the way they\'re currently enforcing the law over there.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the VA -- again on the accountability issue, Josh, this report says that front-line, middle and senior managers -- senior managers -- felt compelled to manipulate VA\xe2\x80\x99s scheduling processes, and that they felt, in fact, that there could be retribution.</p>\n<p>With that being the case as high as senior managers, how is it that here in Washington at the VA, they say they never heard of this going on?\xc2\xa0 And when will there be accountability at the highest levels beside Shinseki, who has resigned obviously?\xc2\xa0 What does the White House plan on doing when somebody was putting pressure on these senior managers to commit fraud?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Right.\xc2\xa0 Jim, there are three or four of the senior-level managers in Phoenix that have been put on administrative leave as a result of these allegations and as a result of the details that have been uncovered from the investigation.\xc2\xa0 So there has been some personnel accountability that\'s already been -- they\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking in Phoenix because of some of the problems that you\xe2\x80\x99ve just identified.</p>\n<p>What we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on -- well, let me point out one other thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve also done, which is that we have removed the 14-day scheduling goal that has led to some of the unintended consequences that you\xe2\x80\x99ve cited -- this creation of these alternate lists and some of these other things that the VA is working through right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it is clear that some personnel changes need to be made, and some have already.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also clear there need to be some management changes in terms of the procedures that the VA has in place to fulfill their responsibilities.\xc2\xa0 So both of those are things that are currently being evaluated, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the President believes is very important.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing inspector general investigation.\xc2\xa0 Mr. Nabors is currently working on his own review.\xc2\xa0 So there are a lot of eyes that are taking a look at this.\xc2\xa0 And the President and other members of this administration remain committed to making sure that we give this problem the due amount of attention and that the creative thinking goes into the reforms that are needed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On student loans, is it responsible to come out here today and announce this -- the President using his pen again, and have no details on how much this is going to cost and how many people are affected?\xc2\xa0 Is that a responsible thing to do?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It is.\xc2\xa0 We have a good sense of how many people are affected; it\xe2\x80\x99s about 5 million students and graduates and their families who are affected by this.\xc2\xa0 In terms of the cost, we\xe2\x80\x99re at the very beginning of this rulemaking process.\xc2\xa0 So as this rule, part -- let me say two things about that.\xc2\xa0 The first is, as part of the rulemaking process, there\xe2\x80\x99s public input on this rulemaking process.\xc2\xa0 So if people have ideas for the way that this rule can be designed to strengthen it or better target it, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly open to those kinds of recommendations and there will be an opportunity for individuals to provide some feedback.</p>\n<p>The second is, is as a result of that process of taking some feedback, we will start to pin down some of the details of that rule.\xc2\xa0 And based on those details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll get a better assessment of exactly what the cost is.\xc2\xa0 And as we get some more of those details, we\xe2\x80\x99ll provide them.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But before the money is spent, will we know those details?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 There certainly will be a process for putting this rule together.\xc2\xa0 And putting this rule together will mean deciding -- making some policy decisions about what the details of the rule are.\xc2\xa0 And then you can make some assessments based on how much that will cost.\xc2\xa0 So there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that\xe2\x80\x99s in place to govern this.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not unique to this field and it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not unique to other things that the President has done to exercise his executive authority to take action on behalf of middle-class families.</p>\n<p>But yes, this is the beginning of a process, not the end.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And if I could just -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, and then one final question on immigration.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re having a meeting, the President is having a meeting today.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a na\xc3\xafve question, but I think people out in the country, outside of Washington, wonder this:\xc2\xa0 The Republicans say that this is the President\xe2\x80\x99s fault because they can\xe2\x80\x99t trust him to enforce the law, and so they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pass it because they don\xe2\x80\x99t trust him.\xc2\xa0 So why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the President just pick up the phone and tell John Boehner, you can trust me, I will do the following, I will enforce the law; or in fact, not only will I enforce the law, you can wait until I\xe2\x80\x99m out of office to have the law take effect?\xc2\xa0 Why can\xe2\x80\x99t a simple conversation like that happen?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those kinds of conversations have taken place.\xc2\xa0 The President, as you know, has spoken to Speaker Boehner on a range of issues, including immigration, in the past.\xc2\xa0 I would actually submit to you that there are actually two better ways for anyone in either party to conclude that the President is serious about enforcing our immigration laws.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The first is, there are any number of people that you can ask inside the President\xe2\x80\x99s party who will say critical things about the President for enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no shortage of people in the Democratic Party who are agitating very aggressively to get the President to consider a range of options that would reduce the impact of the enforcement of the law precisely because the President is enforcing the law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the suggestion that some people don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the President to enforce the law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t withstand a whole lot of scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 I think the other thing that you can do is you can also look at the numbers, and when you take a look at the numbers you will see -- again, much to the chagrin of some people in the President\xe2\x80\x99s party -- that a lot of the metrics related to interdictions and immigration enforcement indicate that that enforcement process is as robust as ever.</p>\n<p>Some of that is a testament to resources that have been dedicated to the border in a way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen before.\xc2\xa0 Those resources have been committed to border security under the President\xe2\x80\x99s watch and with the support of the President.</p>\n<p>So there is no doubt that the President understands that protecting our border security is a key component of our national security.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s also a key component of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 The President said that from the beginning.\xc2\xa0 That focus on border security is included in the compromise legislation that Democrats and Republicans in the Senate both supported.\xc2\xa0 And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason that it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t earn the bipartisan support of Democrats and Republicans in the House, as well.</p>\n<p>Justin.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to kind of follow on immigration.\xc2\xa0 I know you guys have been working to address kind of this influx of unaccompanied minors on the southern border, and what I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in is kind of the political implications of that.\xc2\xa0 We heard a lot from House Republicans over -- or House and Senate Republicans that this was sort of the byproduct of the President putting together DACA, and so, because of the way that that\xe2\x80\x99s been sort of filtered through, immigrant children believe that they can cross the border and stay here.\xc2\xa0 So they\xe2\x80\x99re saying --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put a lot of stock in the ability of members of -- Republican members of Congress to divine the thoughts and insights of children in Central American countries.</p>\n<p>My point is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure this withstands a whole lot of scrutiny.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is that the DACA legislation that you\xe2\x80\x99re referring to, the Dream Act legislation -- or the Dream Act executive action that the President\xe2\x80\x99s administration took only applies to those who -- to minors who immigrated to this country, or who entered this country before June of 2007.\xc2\xa0 So if there are children that are coming to this country now thinking that they are eligible for the Dream Act, they\xe2\x80\x99re not.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a political problem that could impede either immigration reform going through Congress or the administration\xe2\x80\x99s review of where do we start on deportation procedures that you might be able to take --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, if anything, I think it certainly highlights, once again, the need to try to address the problem of immigration reform -- that this is a broken system that we\xe2\x80\x99re operating under here.\xc2\xa0 There has been bipartisan action taken by the United States Senate to try to devise a workable solution that meets the concerns that have been raised by individuals in both parties -- everything from border security, as I mentioned before, to ensuring that there is a level playing field for American businesses and employers in this country, and also to making sure that we reform the legal immigration process to make it easier for people who do want to immigrate to this country legally that they have an opportunity to do so.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So there is compromise legislation that exists, and I recognize that there are, for whatever reason, that there are some who oppose this compromise and will cite a wide range of things to suggest that why they think that immigration reform shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get done.\xc2\xa0 I mean, I guess apparently that extends to trying to divine the motivations and thoughts of minors who don\xe2\x80\x99t live in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you expect the President to take a public stance on this position?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Ed is asking the question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I know.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Regardless of who is to blame for what\xe2\x80\x99s happened, can you just explain what the federal government is doing right now?\xc2\xa0 Because there are alarming reports coming out of Arizona where there are literally hundreds of kids who are unaccompanied by parents or relatives, children of migrants who are being bussed from Texas to Arizona and being left in a detention facility in Nogales.\xc2\xa0 What is the federal government doing with these kids?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s conflating two different things.\xc2\xa0 Let me read this little section here about how we\xe2\x80\x99ve been dealing with this influx that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen of unaccompanied immigrant children:\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The number of children coming alone, particularly from Central America to the United States, has grown significantly in recent years.\xc2\xa0 Many are escaping abuse or persecution, others are fleeing criminal gangs and violence, others are victims of trafficking or abandonment, and others merely seek to reunite with their families in the United States.\xc2\xa0 The entire administration is focused on addressing the immediate and pressing challenges to make sure these children are appropriately cared for as required by federal law.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President and the Secretary of Homeland Security asked the FEMA Administrator, Craig Fugate, to organize the federal response to this urgent humanitarian situation.\xc2\xa0 This means FEMA would lead and coordinate a government-wide effort to identify additional overflow facilities, provide safe and prompt transportation for the children to HHS custody, and provide medical and other services to children in the DHS facilities.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So this will ensure a unity of effort across the federal government in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this urgent situation.\xc2\xa0 So there are resources that are being put in place that are being coordinated by the FEMA Administrator to work with the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and HHS to make sure that we have adequate resources to deal with this influx of unaccompanied minors that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But the governor of Arizona has been a frequent critic, obviously, but still is wondering why these kids are being moved from Texas to Arizona.\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s the rationale?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Now, my understanding of the situation is it\xe2\x80\x99s not kids -- it\xe2\x80\x99s not these unaccompanied minors that are being shipped to Arizona; that there are facilities in Texas and one in California and one in Oklahoma, where unaccompanied minors are being cared for -- again, under the supervision of HHS as required by law, as coordinated by FEMA.</p>\n<p>So in Arizona, what we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is a different situation, which is that there are also situations in which CBP, the Customs and Border Patrol, will come across basically families that are attempting to enter the country.\xc2\xa0 And so what they will often do is to process those families; they will send them to a processing center that has more bandwidth, that has the capacity to process them through the system.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So the kids who are at the facility in Arizona, are crossing the border there, are not being shipped from Texas?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 What we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is that there are some of these families that are attempting to gain entry into the country that have been moved to the Nogales processing facility simply because that facility has some additional bandwidth and capacity to process these families.\xc2\xa0 So that\xe2\x80\x99s the longstanding practice and that\xe2\x80\x99s not anything new, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not related to this recent influx of unaccompanied minors.\xc2\xa0 Does that make sense?\xc2\xa0 Am I clarifying this enough?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Clarifying, but there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of unanswered questions right now as to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening to these kids.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>A couple quick questions on Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 On Friday, the head of the VFW sent a letter to President Obama saying now that you\xe2\x80\x99ve secured the release of Sergeant Bergdahl, when are you going to secure the release of the Marine sergeant who is in a Mexican prison?\xc2\xa0 And specifically, the head of the VFW asked, what is the President -- we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard about Secretary Kerry and others -- what is the President personally doing to get this Marine out of the Mexican prison?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me draw a distinction between the Marine that you\xe2\x80\x99re citing in the Mexican prison and Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 Sergeant Bergdahl was being held by the Taliban, who was engaged in an armed conflict with the United States and coalition forces.\xc2\xa0 And so what was conducted to free Sergeant Bergdahl was a prisoner exchange.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that has been part of winding down armed conflicts for centuries.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And as the President mentioned in his news conference in Europe, this is something that previous presidents going all the way back to President Washington have had to grapple with; that exchanging prisoners at the end of an armed conflict is a necessary part of ending wars.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s something that this President is committed to.</p>\n<p>So separately, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of information to provide you in terms of the current efforts underway --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But is the President pressing to get him back, or not?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, certainly the President is concerned about all detainees -- or Americans who are being held against their will in other countries.\xc2\xa0 And this is something that the President is certainly concerned about.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of what specific efforts are underway, I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of Defense.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Specifically on Bergdahl then, you mentioned, the President has mentioned as well, that at the end of any armed conflict you have these negotiations for a prisoner swap, but as The New York Times points out today, you also as part of those negotiations get the Taliban, in this case, to give up something else -- to renounce violence, renounce terrorism, to reconcile with the Afghan government.\xc2\xa0 If this was, as you just characterized it a minute ago, part of the end of a conflict to do this, why didn\xe2\x80\x99t the President get the Taliban to renounce terrorism, to work again with the Afghan government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The goal of these more recent conversations that senior members of the President\xe2\x80\x99s national security team have been engaged in through the government of Qatar has been an effort to free Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 We have said -- there have been previous reports about efforts to free Sergeant Bergdahl that he could be freed in the context of broader agreements or broader concessions by the Taliban that would promote additional conversations or negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban.</p>\n<p>So it is our -- the goal of this recent effort was to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 That was achieved.\xc2\xa0 If that paves the way -- if that builds a little trust and creates some space to enhance or restart negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a role for the United States and our other coalition partners to play in that, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll welcome that opportunity and we\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly consider it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But since we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten these five Taliban commanders out now, do they have any incentive to actually sit down and work it out I think is the question.\xc2\xa0 Now that this has already happened, are they actually going to sit down?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make the same mistake that some Republican members of Congress did by sort of putting themselves inside the head of somebody in another country.\xc2\xa0 But I do think that common sense does indicate that because there\xe2\x80\x99s an ongoing armed conflict in Afghanistan, that there\xe2\x80\x99s an incentive for both sides to try to resolve their differences.\xc2\xa0 Again, whether they can do that remains to be seen.\xc2\xa0 The odds of that are difficult and long, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s a process that has begun here, it will be a painstaking one and not one that\xe2\x80\x99s resolved overnight.</p>\n<p>But if we can build some trust, and this does create an opportunity for more fruitful conversations, so be it.\xc2\xa0 But the ultimate goal here was to fulfill a promise that every Commander-in-Chief, going back to George Washington, has made to every single American who has put on the uniform of the United States military, which is not to leave them behind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one.\xc2\xa0 If a soldier deserts his or her colleagues in war, a U.S. soldier, does that person serve with honor and distinction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking me a hypothetical question.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s not -- might not hypothetical this time.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It might not be hypothetical in this case.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it might or it might not be.\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of evidence suggesting it happened.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, a lot of evidence doesn\'t indicate that you should jump to conclusions or that anybody should jump to conclusions.\xc2\xa0 The fact of the matter is the Department of Defense --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So why did Susan Rice say that he --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let me finish, let me finish.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But if she didn\'t have all the facts that day, why did she say that it was honor and distinction?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 The Department of Defense -- the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have indicated the Department of Defense has a regular process, a standard operating procedure for determining whether or not -- for taking a look at these kinds of circumstances.\xc2\xa0 And there will be a process that they will undertake.</p>\n<p>Right now what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is making sure that Sergeant Bergdahl gets the kind of medical treatment that he needs after five years in Taliban captivity.\xc2\xa0 There will be a time and a place for a review to be conducted about the circumstances of his disappearance.\xc2\xa0 And General Dempsey and Secretary Hagel have indicated that that will occur.</p>\n<p>You\xe2\x80\x99re asking me separately about Susan Rice\xe2\x80\x99s comments about serving with honor and distinction.\xc2\xa0 And the point that I would make to you is that anybody, any American who puts on the uniform and volunteers to fight for this country overseas is doing something honorable and is serving the country.</p>\n<p>Michelle.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You mentioned if this swap does anything to build trust or pave the way -- so are you saying that there is no indication at this point now that it has done anything to build trust or pave the way for more discussion?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think what I would say is that that\'s the kind of thing that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to determine after a couple of days.\xc2\xa0 I think that that\'s the kind of thing --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be part of the discussion, though?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Part of what discussion?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Leading up to the swap, that there would be some kind of understanding or some kind of moving forward, or let this be a start to things?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Again, Michelle, the discussions were focused on one thing, which is securing the safe recovery of Sergeant Bergdahl.\xc2\xa0 And there has been a lot of talk over the years, over a decade you might say, of suggestions that there should be some sort of way to reach an agreement between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban.\xc2\xa0 At the risk of putting too fine a point on it here, in the last several weeks when these discussions were ongoing about securing the release of Sergeant Bergdahl, we did not want to reduce the likelihood of our success in securing his release by injecting a rather complicated variable into it, which is making it contingent upon some negotiations that have been stopped and started countless times over the last 10 years.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl -- and we did that -- and we did that in a way that protects our national security, as concluded by the President, as certified by the Department of Defense.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that we were able to secure the release of Sergeant Bergdahl.</p>\n<p>The question, though, is an open one, which is:\xc2\xa0 Does this pave the way for more fruitful talks?\xc2\xa0 And I think what I would say to that is it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to tell.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of -- you can\'t reach a conclusion about that kind of thing within just a few days.\xc2\xa0 This is the kind of thing that you can ascertain over a period of time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Okay, and quickly -- Susan Rice also said over the weekend, I think she said the U.S. is leading in lethal and nonlethal aid to Syria.\xc2\xa0 Can you just clarify those comments?\xc2\xa0 Because since then I think there\xe2\x80\x99s been some vagaries among different parts of the administration depending on who is asked.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think this is the way that I would describe it to you -- that we remain committed to building the capacity of the moderate opposition in Syria, including through the provision of assistance to vetted members of the moderate armed opposition.</p>\n<p>While I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to detail all of our assistance, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear, we provide both military and nonmilitary assistance to the opposition.\xc2\xa0 That\'s been our position for some time, and those efforts are still underway.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So though she said lethal aid, can we just say that some of that military aid is lethal aid at this point?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, you can say whatever you want.\xc2\xa0 What I will say is that --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We want to be accurate, right?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 -- is that we continue to provide assistance.\xc2\xa0 And if that\'s the case, then I think what I would encourage you to -- the way that I would describe this to you is that we continue to provide assistance to vetted members of the moderate opposition, and that assistance can be described as both military and nonmilitary.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll remind you that the United States continues to be the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to the Syrian opposition.\xc2\xa0 So there are a variety of ways in which the United States can offer assistance to the moderate opposition.</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also a way that we can try to address some of the terrible humanitarian need that exists there.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But she said lethal aid, so she did not misspeak?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what she was doing is she was describing the military and the nonmilitary assistance that we have been providing.\xc2\xa0 In terms of describing it as lethal or nonlethal, that\'s not something that I can provide to you.\xc2\xa0 But I can describe to you that the opposition -- that the assistance that we provide to the moderate opposition could accurately be described as both military and nonmilitary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting close to the President.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to move quickly here.\xc2\xa0 Bill?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, since it\xe2\x80\x99s now quite evident that the U.S. knew during negotiations going back a couple of years of the circumstances of Bergdahl\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, was it a good idea to have a welcoming ceremony in the Rose Garden when it was announced?\xc2\xa0 You made a big deal out of it.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think what the President did was the President invited all of you to the Rose Garden where he made a statement, a very simple but profound statement about the commitment of the United States government being rock solid and unbreakable, which is that if you put on the military uniform of this country, you will not be left behind.\xc2\xa0 That was a very powerful thing for the President to say.</p>\n<p>I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right, it was made more powerful by having the parents of Sergeant Bergdahl standing next to the President when he delivered that statement.\xc2\xa0 But that was a clear, unmistakable signal to everybody in the country, everybody in this country, to everybody who puts on the uniform, and to countries around the world that when you wear the uniform of the United States military, you\xe2\x80\x99re not left behind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You didn\'t have to do that in the Rose Garden.\xc2\xa0 Knowing the circumstances --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 No, we didn\'t have to do that in the Rose Garden, but that is a very important principle, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an important principle for people in this country to understand.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s important for people who wear the military uniform to understand.\xc2\xa0 And it\xe2\x80\x99s an important principle for people all across the world to understand.\xc2\xa0 So standing in the Rose Garden to make that assessment, or make that commitment clear is exactly what the President chose to do.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But just following up, Josh, why not --</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll come right back to you, Mara.\xc2\xa0 Hold on.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to follow up on immigration.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Okay.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Can we just finish Bergdahl first, just quickly?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s let Chuck go, and then --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 To go back to the question that you were asked previously that you didn\'t answer, which is, is there any concern at the White House that the illusion that people -- that minors are protected here as part of the DREAM Act -- whether it was the executive action here or, frankly, the one part of where there appears to be bipartisan compromise on the Hill when it comes to DREAMers -- that it\xe2\x80\x99s being used as an incentive to get families to send their children over the border, that it\xe2\x80\x99s sort\xc2\xa0 of being used -- no matter what the law says -- and I understand what you quoted on the law -- but is the White House concerned this is being used as a way to try to tell families that if you want to get over, send your kids by themselves first and then maybe you can get over to join them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I mean, when you say \xe2\x80\x9cused,\xe2\x80\x9d used by whom?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Well, maybe people that want to get over here or think that, hey, if they send their kids over the border first, they\xe2\x80\x99ll be protected, they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to be sent back.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s hard I think for any of us, really, to put ourselves in the position of a family or an individual that\xe2\x80\x99s facing a question like that.\xc2\xa0 I think all I can do is --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But you do agree this is a crisis, right?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I think all I can do is speak to the facts, which are that if there are unaccompanied minors who show up at the border today or tomorrow, those individuals are not eligible for the deferred action -- executive action that this administration announced a couple of years ago.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s simply a fact.</p>\n<p>And for those Republican members of Congress who are trying to figure out whether or not they can trust the President in terms of his enforcement of the law, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been very clear about that, and that the law has been enforced that way accordingly.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Are these unaccompanied minors going to be sent back to their home country?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding -- and you can ask DHS --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- how the process works?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 And you can ask DHS for more details about this, but my understanding about the way that it works is the law does require that we render assistance to those children, and that is a process that begins with DHS when they are detained.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re transferred to the custody of HHS, who provides for their basic health care.\xc2\xa0 And then they go through a process to determine whether they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be sent back to another country, how they\xe2\x80\x99ll be sent back to another country, or how that process is otherwise resolved.</p>\n<p>And again, you can check with DHS for more details about that process.\xc2\xa0 But that\xe2\x80\x99s my understanding about the way that it works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, on that point, Cecilia Mu\xc3\xb1oz said on Monday that there are rumors being spread in Central America that is causing people to send their children to the U.S.\xc2\xa0 So what is the administration doing to counter those rumors that you said are going on in Central America, saying that if children come to the border they will be allowed in?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think one thing that we can do is to be as clear as possible about the law and about what the consequences are for making a decision like that.\xc2\xa0 And I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s what I and others have tried to do today and previously.</p>\n<p>Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President speak on this?\xc2\xa0 Because, after all, people are hearing his words, even as far away as Honduras.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Alexis.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, just following up on Bergdahl --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that as a no-comment.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 -- in Brussels, the President said that the administration was continually trying to brief members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 And I know you saw that the Intelligence Chair and the Ranking Member said yesterday that they had not been updated or briefed about the latest information, that Sergeant -- has been providing about his captivity.\xc2\xa0 Can you say today whether the President hopes that the administration will continue to update or try to update members who said that they were in the dark about this new information?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on the new information that was reported over the weekend, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to comment on whether or not -- how that information has been shared within the government.\xc2\xa0 I can just merely convey to you that this administration continues to be committed to coordinating with our partners in Congress, particularly those who lead the relevant committees.\xc2\xa0 So we\xe2\x80\x99ll be continue to be engaged in that coordination progress.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of specific conversations that have been had as a result of that commitment to coordination and consultation, I\xe2\x80\x99m not able to provide any insight.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just for our own follow-up, are you not going to be able to comment today, tomorrow, any day, on information that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of debriefings with Sergeant Bergdahl?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to predict the future on this.\xc2\xa0 I mean, suffice it to say that at this point I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to comment on those reports.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you do know the information and you\xe2\x80\x99re not allowed to say?\xc2\xa0 Or why?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think because right now what we\xe2\x80\x99re focused on is making sure that Sergeant Bergdahl is getting the care and attention that he needs after five years in Taliban captivity.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the focal point on our efforts right now.</p>\n<p>QBut you\xe2\x80\x99re not denying the reports in the major media?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not in a position to confirm or deny them.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re going to be focused on providing him some care.</p>\n<p>I will point out that this is not actually my first day in this job.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Jay will be back later this week, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to conclude that after a couple of days of doing that somebody changes their mind.\xc2\xa0 That would be terrible.</p>\n<p>QDoes the President have a copy of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book?\xc2\xa0 And has he bought a house in Asheville, North Carolina?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Those are two wildly different questions.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A simple yes or no will do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the President has purchased the book.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s available for sale yet, is it?</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Oh, yes.</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 You can find it somewhere?\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99s read the book.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not purchased a house in --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a report he\xe2\x80\x99s bought a retirement home for after the presidency in Asheville, North Carolina.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 That is not true.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Josh, a question on unemployment insurance.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Sam.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 House Democrats today said that 3 million Americans have now seen their unemployment insurance lapse.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering what, beyond occasionally mentioning the topic at the briefing, what the White House is doing to try to push through a compromise on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, there are a handful of Republicans who have stepped forward to try to work with us and try to work with Democrats on the Hill to move this forward, but there\xe2\x80\x99s only one reason this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten done, and the reason for that, Sam, is that congressional Republicans in both the Senate and the House have blocked it.</p>\n<p>There is a clear case to be made that this would meet an urgent need that\xe2\x80\x99s being felt by families across the country.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s a clear case to be made about the benefits that this would have for the broader economy.\xc2\xa0 But Republicans seem unmoved by those facts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the reason it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten done.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So what are you doing to move them?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 Well, we are in regular consultation with members of Congress, particularly Republicans, on a range of issues, not the least of which is ways that we can take steps that would strengthen our economy and things that we can do to strengthen the financial standing of middle-class families.\xc2\xa0 And this is certainly an example of one of them.\xc2\xa0 But again, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the only example of Republicans standing in the way of commonsense policy decisions that would benefit middle-class families in this country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99re in regular consultation with members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 Does that include Speaker Boehner, who has said specifically that he wants to see the platform of the White House on this issue?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything specific to -- any specific conversations to read out.\xc2\xa0 But there is a compromise piece of legislation that has been proposed by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate that we have indicated that we\xe2\x80\x99re generally supportive of.</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll do one last question.\xc2\xa0 Zeke.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Josh.\xc2\xa0 Just following up on the former Marine -- you said earlier that he was a detainee.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that is a -- is that a reflection of any sort of legal determination made by the U.S. government?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not.\xc2\xa0 And if I said that, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to further confuse the issue.\xc2\xa0 I think he\xe2\x80\x99s being detained in Mexico, is what I was trying to convey.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then also, in terms of that, does the President, does the administration have confidence in the Mexican criminal justice system, in the prosecutors there to see this case through?\xc2\xa0 Or is the U.S. government putting pressure on Mexican authorities outside of that system?</p>\n<p>MR. EARNEST:\xc2\xa0 In terms of the conversations that we\xe2\x80\x99re having with the Mexican government I\xe2\x80\x99d refer you to the Department of State.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you guys get covering the President\xe2\x80\x99s event.\xc2\xa0 Thanks very much.\xc2\xa0 See you tomorrow.</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:51 P.M.
