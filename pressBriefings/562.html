Brady Press Briefing Room</p>\n<p>12:26 P.M. EST</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Oooh --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s applause in the back.\xc2\xa0 Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say you\xe2\x80\x99re not the only one.\xc2\xa0 It took more time than I expected.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Straight razor in a barber shop?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, no, I did it at home this morning.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Why?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, okay a couple reasons -- because I heard that Ann Compton had bet that I would shave before State of the Union, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her to lose money.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And also if you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Cody Keenan\xe2\x80\x99s beard you know that I have a daily reminder of the insufficiency of my effort.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 And I decided the time had to come to shave.\xc2\xa0 So here I am, the old me.</p>\n<p>I have no other announcements to make today, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll go straight to your questions.\xc2\xa0 Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks, Jay.\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s quite the visual.\xc2\xa0 On the State of the Union, I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether the President sees this one any differently than previous States of the Union.\xc2\xa0 Is it going to be a kind of a bullet-point speech where he outlines a lot of initiatives and requests to Congress?\xc2\xa0 Or is it going to be more of a thematic speech that expands on his December 4th speech on the economy and mobility?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, Jim, without previewing with any specificity what the President will be saying on Tuesday night, I can tell you a few things.\xc2\xa0 This is, every year, a unique opportunity for the President to speak to millions of Americans who tune in and listen to the State of the Union address, and he very much looks forward to it.\xc2\xa0 And he, himself, and the members of his team take the honor and responsibility of crafting a State of the Union address and delivering it before Congress and the American people very seriously.\xc2\xa0 There aren\xe2\x80\x99t many opportunities that a President gets to speak on primetime television to talk about his or her agenda for the country moving forward.</p>\n<p>So I think you can expect him to be consistent with where he\xe2\x80\x99s been in terms of describing his priorities.\xc2\xa0 And that top priority has always been, since he first ran for President, the need to grow our economy in a way that rewards hard work and responsibility, that makes the middle class more secure, that expands economic opportunity and provides a ladder up to those aspiring to the middle class.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s been his central preoccupation since he first thought about running for the Senate and then the presidency.\xc2\xa0 And you can certainly expect that that will be the focus of what he talks about not just next week but throughout the rest of his presidency.</p>\n<p>The process is one that, in keeping with past practice, involves gathering policy councils and experts, both internally and externally, beginning a few months before the address, and then a parallel process with his Director of Speechwriting -- the aforementioned bearded Cody Keenan -- and working that through over a number of weeks, most intensely obviously upon return from the Christmas and New Year holiday.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 He has talked about asking his Cabinet to provide him with ideas for executive actions.\xc2\xa0 Do you expect to have a long list of those kinds of executive actions that he intends to --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to, again, preview specifics about what might be in the speech.\xc2\xa0 There\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the President has made clear that he wants to reemphasize the capacity that he as President has because of the unique power of the office to advance an agenda both working with Congress and using his executive authority -- so, with his pen to sign bills and with his phone to gather people from across the country who he can persuade and urge to work with him to advance some of the goals that will help the middle class.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that with the skills summit that we had in which so many college presidents participated.\xc2\xa0 You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in the manufacturing hub that was announced and the Promise Zones that we\xe2\x80\x99ve talked about.\xc2\xa0 And you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it again and again.</p>\n<p>Again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to specify what will be in the State of the Union, but that idea is not unique, and it\'s certainly true that he has solicited ideas for ways to move the country forward from his Cabinet, from his staff, and from people outside the administration and outside government across the country.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask you about a confirmation hearing recently that has gotten some viral attention, and that is the President\'s nominee for ambassador to Norway, George Tsunis.\xc2\xa0 He bungled the answer to a question from Senator McCain; he seemed to not have a full understanding of the coalition government in Norway.\xc2\xa0 I wonder if the President still has confidence in Mr. Tsunis\xe2\x80\x99s ability to represent the country.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the hearing or the testimony.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that this President has confidence in all of the nominees he\'s put forward for ambassadorial positions as well as other positions in the administration, in the government.\xc2\xa0 But beyond that I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a response.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I wanted to ask what the administration\'s policy is on releasing ACA enrollment data.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Our policy is to make sure before it\'s released that it\'s accurate, that it\'s scrubbed.\xc2\xa0 And that process has become more efficient, but we always -- when we release data, we explain caveats when they\'re approximations or what the data represents and what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t represent.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case from the beginning.</p>\n<p>Early on, when we had a lot of trouble with the website and gathering data from all the states that are running their own exchanges, this process was less efficient in so many ways, as you know, and it has obviously improved dramatically.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It seemed like on one hand you seemed to tell us early on that it would be mid-month the month following that you would release once it was scrubbed.\xc2\xa0 But today, some data was released just before -- some good news data just before the State of the Union.\xc2\xa0 So is there going to be more frequent updating?\xc2\xa0 Is there a change in the policy?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The data comes from CMS and HHS, so I would refer questions about how that\xe2\x80\x99s compiled and released to them.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that the approach we\'ve taken as an administration has been to make sure that the data we release is clear and not duplicative, and scrubbed and vetted.\xc2\xa0 And that process has become more efficient as the whole system has become more efficient and as healthcare.gov has improved dramatically, which I know at least some of you have noted.</p>\n<p>So I think if you are referring to today\'s numbers, they represent significant progress in enrollments or signups to the marketplaces, both federal and state -- roughly 3 million people so far, and I think from what I saw, more than 800,000 in January.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a dramatic improvement over what we saw in the very beginning, in October and November.\xc2\xa0 We saw a surge in December as the website fixes began to take effect, and those improvements continue to result in more and more Americans being able to sign up on these marketplaces.\xc2\xa0 And I think it demonstrates that the problems we had early on with the website\xc2\xa0 were the obstacle.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And we often talk about the grit and determination of the American people, and deservedly so.\xc2\xa0 They\'re the reason why we have climbed out of the worst recession since the Great Depression.\xc2\xa0 They\'re the reason why the President is optimistic about this year and the potential that this year has for further economic growth and job creation.\xc2\xa0 They\'re also the reason -- and their grit and determination is also the reason why, even faced with the obstacles that we put in front of them with the crummy start to the website, they have demonstrated a persistence in their desire for the product that\xe2\x80\x99s on offer here, which is quality, affordable health insurance.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what today\'s numbers represent.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Republican senators said in a letter to the President today that the President told them last March that there would be a decision on Keystone by the end of 2013.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering if that\xe2\x80\x99s true and -- if it\xe2\x80\x99s true that he said that, and if there\xe2\x80\x99s any update on the timing of the process.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not aware of the conversation that they cite.\xc2\xa0 We tend not to read out private conversations with senators.\xc2\xa0 But what I can tell you is this process is run and housed at the State Department, consistent with past practice of previous administrations.\xc2\xa0 Its delay originally was obviously driven in part by actions -- ideological actions by Congress, by the House, and also by concerns expressed by political leaders and government leaders of both parties.\xc2\xa0 So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know -- I would refer you to the State Department on where that process is now.</p>\n<p>Jim.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Getting back to the State of the Union, isn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the purpose and a large part of the purpose of that speech to call on Congress to pass parts of the President\xe2\x80\x99s agenda?\xc2\xa0 But if the President is going to go to the Congress and say I\xe2\x80\x99m going to use my executive powers, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that sort of defeat the purpose of a State of the Union speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty narrow view of a State of the Union address to suggest that he is speaking to the members of the Senate and the House alone.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re physically in the room, but millions of Americans are tuning in and the President is speaking to every American.\xc2\xa0 There are elected representatives and folks across the country sitting in their living rooms or their kitchens and watching a President give his State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So, look, I think the American people -- and I know the President thinks this -- want the folks they send to Washington to get on with the business of helping the economy grow, helping it create jobs, helping make sure that the opportunity exists for their kids to get ahead and get educated and move up the economic ladder, and have it better than they did.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s the sort of definition of the American Dream.\xc2\xa0 And however Washington goes about making their lives a little easier and providing more opportunity is irrelevant -- whether it\xe2\x80\x99s through legislation or through executive action.\xc2\xa0 They just want it done.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the President will absolutely talk about what we can do together, the administration and Congress, to move that agenda forward.\xc2\xa0 But as he\xe2\x80\x99s been making clear, he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to limit himself to that.\xc2\xa0 That would be like for a President, any President of any party, to tie his or her hand -- one hand behind his back and not use all the powers available to him, the unique powers of the presidency, to move the country forward.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So the President is going to talk about all the things that a President can do, that he can do, that he believes we should do together.\xc2\xa0 And when he says together, he doesn\'t just mean the 535 elected members of Congress.\xc2\xa0 He means those Americans and business leaders and faith leaders and community leaders and average folks across the country who can join in the effort to help this country move forward, make the middle class more secure, make sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity for everyone out there -- that if they\'re willing to work and be responsible, that they will be rewarded for that work, and they will have more security and more capacity to provide for their families and help their children move up and do better than they did.\xc2\xa0 That\'s kind of what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about as far as the President is concerned.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have heard, House Speaker John Boehner has taken that phrase from the President, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pen and I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a phone,\xe2\x80\x9d as sort of a challenge to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s part of the equation here.\xc2\xa0 And the Speaker has said there\xe2\x80\x99s also such a thing as the Constitution.\xc2\xa0 Is the President -- when he says that, is he saying that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be going around Congress?\xc2\xa0 Is he going to be delivering that message?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President has been clear that he will work with Congress where Congress is willing to work with him, but where Congress refuses to move forward and cooperate on common-sense ideas to help the economy, help the middle class, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to use every power that he has to advance that agenda.</p>\n<p>And I don\'t think anyone should be surprised by that.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the approach he\xe2\x80\x99s taken throughout his presidency and he\xe2\x80\x99s simply making clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to reenergize that approach and solicit ideas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But he\xe2\x80\x99ll make that clear in the speech?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 That both -- I think since he has been in remarks he\xe2\x80\x99s made on so many occasions, I think you can expect that he\xe2\x80\x99ll make clear that he wants to work with Congress, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll make clear that all of us can act to make improvements in our economy and in the security of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 And not all of the things that we can do have to result in legislation that passes through the House and the Senate.</p>\n<p>I think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a very constricted view to suggest that the only way to measure progress in our country is through the number of bills that have passed.\xc2\xa0 That\'s important, and there are things that only can be done -- or can only be done through legislation.\xc2\xa0 Comprehensive immigration reform comes to mind, and there are certainly many others.\xc2\xa0 And the President welcomes and seeks cooperation from Congress in advancing an agenda that\'s not partisan but that is aimed at helping the American people.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And, Jay, very quickly, getting back to the questions about Iran and the interim nuclear deal from earlier this week.\xc2\xa0 A top Republican House lawmaker who said he has actually viewed the text of that agreement says that there are no signatures on it from the parties involved.\xc2\xa0 And I was just curious is the White House concerned that --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not familiar with how this process works. There is no question that Iran and the members of the P5-plus-1 have entered into an agreement, the Joint Plan of Action, that commits both parties, both sides, and particularly the Iranians to a series of actions.\xc2\xa0 And the IAEA has validated that Iran has begun taking the steps that they committed to take in that agreement, so that\xe2\x80\x99s how the process works.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So in relation to the State of the Union and to income equality or the income gap that is in this country, what are the areas of common ground right now between the President and Congress that might see some moving forward in the next year?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 When it comes to one very specific thing, raising the minimum wage, that\'s something that has been done by Republicans and Democrats in the past.\xc2\xa0 That\'s something that economists have made clear is a positive step when it comes to rewarding hard work and rewarding responsibility and lifting Americans who are working hard and acting responsibly out of difficult economic circumstances.</p>\n<p>I think as a basic premise that if you\'re working full-time and doing everything you can to fulfill your responsibilities to yourself and your family and your community, you ought to at least be paid a living wage; you ought not be in poverty working full-time.\xc2\xa0 And the President believes that raising the minimum wage, which costs not a cent when it comes to the deficit, is the right and responsible thing to do.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>That\'s just one thing.\xc2\xa0 There are certainly -- passing comprehensive immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 I\'ve done it before and I can certainly lay it out for you again all of the economic benefits and all the benefits to the middle class and to growth that passing that legislation would provide.\xc2\xa0 So that\'s another means by which we could ensure that all of our businesses are playing by the same set of rules, that, again, responsible behavior and hard work is rewarded, that our borders are more secure.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why, in that case -- and this goes to why this is something that Congress has to do but it\xe2\x80\x99s bigger than that -- there\xe2\x80\x99s a reason why big business and small business, labor, faith leaders, law enforcement leaders across the country, Democrats and Republicans, governors, local legislators, members of Congress all support this -- because it\xe2\x80\x99s not an ideological thing.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the right thing to do.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s the smart thing to do for our economy.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But on minimum wage, following up, do you believe that there is a common ground there?\xc2\xa0 Recently, senators on the Republican side have said that that\'s not, that in fact, that will cost more jobs if there\xe2\x80\x99s minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 Do you think there\xe2\x80\x99s legislation possible there?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 History and economic studies rebut that assertion.\xc2\xa0 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent some lawmakers from making it, but the facts just aren\xe2\x80\x99t with them on that.\xc2\xa0 And the fact is there has been support in the past from Republicans as well as Democrats to raising the minimum wage.\xc2\xa0 I think in terms of real dollars, the minimum wage today is roughly where it was when Harry Truman was President.\xc2\xa0 And these are folks who, by definition, are working hour by hour, day by day, to try to make ends meet.\xc2\xa0 They\xe2\x80\x99re behaving responsibly, they\xe2\x80\x99re working hard, they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to take care of themselves and their families, and they ought to at least get a living wage.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And then on immigration, you mentioned the common ground you think that is there.\xc2\xa0 But is the President, in the State of the Union, going to say that he will take some unilateral action if it\xe2\x80\x99s not passed soon?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Again, I won\xe2\x80\x99t preview the specifics of the State of the Union address.\xc2\xa0 That would be risky behavior professionally.\xc2\xa0 So I -- (laughter) -- in all seriousness, I really urge you to wait and see what the President has to say on a variety of topics.\xc2\xa0 What I can tell you is that he strongly believes that Congress ought to -- or the House ought to follow the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s lead here and pass bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation so that he can sign it into law and the country can enjoy all of the benefits -- the security benefits, the economic benefits -- that passing that legislation would provide.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, just to follow up on that.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Because you\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear from the podium, and others in the building have, that immigration is not an area which the President is looking currently at using executive authority, that he wants to give the House Republicans time and space to work this out.\xc2\xa0 That is still the case, correct?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the case that we believe that comprehensive immigration reform is the -- I mean, the only way to reform our immigration system comprehensively is through legislation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to do it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 No, but you don\'t --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, yes, you\xe2\x80\x99re correct, and we believe, having said all this and called on the House to act, it\xe2\x80\x99s also the case that there\xe2\x80\x99s some reason to be cautiously optimistic about immigration reform eventually clearing both houses and getting to the President\xe2\x80\x99s desk -- not because we\xe2\x80\x99ve come up with better ways to urge Congress to take action or urge the House to take action, but because the economic benefits are so apparent and the House Republican leaders have at various times made clear that they want to advance immigration reform legislation.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what steps they take.\xc2\xa0 But there is this opportunity.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s a way to show the people in this country, in the United States, that Democrats and Republicans can come together and do something important for the economy and for their security.\xc2\xa0 And we\xe2\x80\x99re hopeful that Congress will take the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 A couple of data points on that.\xc2\xa0 Paul Ryan said yesterday in San Antonio that it was -- the House Republican leadership believed it was time to move those in the shadows out of the shadows.\xc2\xa0 He talked about a four-stage process of immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 House Republicans have put that on their legislative agenda for their retreat coming up in a week or so.\xc2\xa0 And also Paul Ryan said that it would probably be important within that legislation with whatever final compromise emerges that there be some language attached that would require the President to implement all the law in full.\xc2\xa0 This would speak to some Republican concerns about parts of the Affordable Care Act that have been delayed or waived.\xc2\xa0 Would the administration have any opposition to language like that in an immigration reform bill?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to respond to speculative language in a speculative bill that is, at this point, just speculation.\xc2\xa0 I think one of the signs of progress that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen is the announcement by leaders in the House that they will put forward principles on immigration reform.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.\xc2\xa0 As you know, the President did that a number of years ago, and the Senate passed a bipartisan bill that reflects those principles.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform, the President believes the reason why we need to do it in a comprehensive way, meeting the four principles that he laid out, is because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way to achieve it.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And there have been questions about how the House gets from here to there, and obviously -- quoting the President from an interview last fall, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf Speaker Boehner thinks that procedurally he has to jump through a series of hoops, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to let the House work its will as long as the bill that ends up on my desk speaks to the central issues that have to be resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d<br/>\n\t\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tSo how, procedurally, the House gets to a final result that represents that kind of bipartisan compromise that we saw in the Senate is obviously up to the House leadership.\xc2\xa0 What the President hopes is that the result will be something that meets the standards set by the principles he laid out, meets the expectations of the broad community across the nation that supports comprehensive immigration reform, and therefore meets the test that will allow him to sign it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Do you find the Ryan rhetoric in this announcement of principles new evidence of progress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that the more that House Republican leaders talk about the need to move forward on immigration reform is clearly a positive thing.\xc2\xa0 That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s easy or we\xe2\x80\x99re there yet, but, yes, I would say that that\xe2\x80\x99s a positive thing.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 What is the administration\xe2\x80\x99s take on the violence in Egypt?\xc2\xa0 And what does it represent?\xc2\xa0 And the omnibus bill signed provides it some retrenchment of money.\xc2\xa0 Where are things politically and on the ground from the administration\xe2\x80\x99s point of view?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, let me say that we strongly condemn the terrorist attacks this morning in Cairo, and these crimes should be investigated fully and the perpetrators should be brought to justice.\xc2\xa0 We extend our condolences to the families and friends of the victims, and we hope for the quick and full recovery of the survivors.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Regarding the clashes today in Cairo, the United States again urges all sides to condemn and prevent violence.\xc2\xa0 It should be clear to all Egyptians that violence has not and will not move Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s political transition forward.\xc2\xa0 Ongoing unrest and cycles of violence surrounding protests hurt Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s prospects for political and economic stability.</p>\n<p>Now, we obviously follow these events very closely.\xc2\xa0 The President has been briefed by his national security team on the events on the ground in Egypt and this is obviously something that is of regular concern for us as we see these events unfold.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On minimum wage, there is some expectation and certainly some hope among Democratic quarters that at the State of the Union the President will announce that, among the executive actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taking, he\xe2\x80\x99s requiring federal contractors to provide minimum wage for those of their employees.\xc2\xa0 I know you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to tell us whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do that. Can you tell us whether that\xe2\x80\x99s been given serious consideration?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I will just say, Major, that the President has -- in talking to members of Congress, talking to business leaders, his team talking to folks both inside and outside of government -- assembled a lot of different ideas about advancing the central goal here, which is improving the lot of the middle class, expanding opportunity and job creation.\xc2\xa0 But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into specifics.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>The President believes that Congress ought to pass legislation, as so many states have, to raise the minimum wage so that folks out there who are working hard, meeting their responsibilities by doing so, are getting at least a living wage in return.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s something that not just Democrats but Republicans have supported in the past.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s something that some Republicans support now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So we hope that that can happen.\xc2\xa0 But when it comes to the variety of actions that have been suggested to the President and that we may or may not be considering, all I can say is, yes, there have been a ton of ideas proposed in this process and we certainly consider all serious ones.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last thing.\xc2\xa0 It was said here earlier this week among some conversations I had that the administration was not as satisfied as it would like to be with the Russian government sharing of threat information as regards the Sochi Olympics.\xc2\xa0 Has there been any progress on that this week?\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a very heavily focused issue this week.\xc2\xa0 Do you think things are in a better place than they were, say, as compared to Sunday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99d say a couple things.\xc2\xa0 We are in regular contact with the Russian government on these issues.\xc2\xa0 We have diplomatic security and FBI teams that will be in place, and that obviously requires close cooperation with host nation security officials.\xc2\xa0 And that is taking place.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we\xe2\x80\x99re always seeking more information from the Russians.\xc2\xa0 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that this is distinct or different from, say, a situation when we had the Olympics in the United Kingdom or in Canada, where we obviously have extremely close ties and extremely close cooperation between our intelligence services.\xc2\xa0 But we do have cooperation as a general issue, on counterterrorism in particular, with Russia on intelligence matters and we will continue to press for as much information as we can get as we also offer as much help as the Russians may want to request in providing security for the Sochi Olympics.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have things gotten any better?\xc2\xa0 You see stories across the board now of American athletes asking their folks or instructing their folks not to even come because they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about their family\xe2\x80\x99s safety and they want to focus on the athletic competition.\xc2\xa0 Are things any better on this continuum than they were, say, a week ago?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I would simply say that we have no doubt that the Russian government very much takes seriously the need to make the Olympic Games safe and secure for participants and spectators.\xc2\xa0 We have no doubt that it\xe2\x80\x99s in their absolute interest to take all the necessary precautions to ensure the safety and security of the Olympic Games.\xc2\xa0 And we are working with them and other nations in taking the precautions that we can take, mindful of the fact that Russia, as host nation, has the lead in security.\xc2\xa0 But I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve described -- the Department of Defense has described some of the measures that we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously offering, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, assistance to the Russians should they need it or require it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to do that.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Ed.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 In terms of assistance -- on that issue -- who will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s point person on the ground once the Olympics start?\xc2\xa0 Is it whoever the lead FBI agent is?\xc2\xa0 As you said, there are FBI agents there.\xc2\xa0 Or Janet Napolitano is obviously helping to lead the President\xe2\x80\x99s delegation there -- as a former Homeland Security Secretary she obviously has a unique background.\xc2\xa0 Do you know who will be the President\xe2\x80\x99s sort of point person, eyes and ears on the ground God forbid there\xe2\x80\x99s a situation?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about as a security matter, Secretary Napolitano is leading the delegation, the U.S. delegation.\xc2\xa0 And obviously because of her experience at DHS, she has serious security credentials.\xc2\xa0 But we will have, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve noted, Diplomatic Security agents as well as FBI agents, as is normal in this kind of situation, working on the ground in Sochi. So I would expect that that would be the means by which security issues were discussed and conversations would be had back and forth here.</p>\n<p>You may check -- because DS is State Department and FBI is Justice -- with those departments to get more information about how that process will work.\xc2\xa0 Because I think I announced yesterday, the President\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, Lisa Monaco, is overseeing a working group on this issue, and they will obviously meet regularly and update officials on new information, including the President, as it becomes available.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I want to go back to the health care numbers.\xc2\xa0 On the question of how you release the enrollment data, obviously more positive data it seems on enrollment figures in private insurance.\xc2\xa0 When will you release the data?\xc2\xa0 Or where are you in the process in terms of releasing how many people have actually paid into the system, how many people have paid their premiums, et cetera?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve been asking about that previously.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good question, and I think CMS might be a better place to answer it.\xc2\xa0 I think the issue here is that the contract is not with the government.\xc2\xa0 The contract -- if you, Ed Henry, were to enroll in health insurance through the marketplace and pick a plan, you are engaging in a contract with a private insurance company.\xc2\xa0 So it\xe2\x80\x99s something that the insurance company knows if and when it gets payment.</p>\n<p>Now, we have, as you know, in the run-up to the December 31st -- January 1st deadline, engaged with insurers across the country as well as those who would be insured to make that process, especially in the initial phase, as smooth as possible, and to encourage those who were enrolled to take all the steps necessary to make sure that their payments were in on time.\xc2\xa0 But CMS may have more specific information.\xc2\xa0 I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how able we are to track that data.\xc2\xa0 But as is the case and has been the case throughout the history of our private health insurance, it\xe2\x80\x99s not between the government and an individual; it\xe2\x80\x99s between the individual and the insurance company.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the numbers -- over 3 million enrolled -- private insurance; 6 million in Medicaid, I believe.\xc2\xa0 And last night you had the Republican Governor of Utah, Governor Herbert, say that he will expand Medicaid, which is something I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do around the country.\xc2\xa0 Some governors have done it, some haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xc2\xa0 My question being, with those numbers, with some Republican governors now saying they will expand Medicaid, where are we in this?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like you are turning the corner?\xc2\xa0 Do you feel like -- what is the President\xe2\x80\x99s approach as he goes into the State of the Union, and as you say, not just addresses Congress but addresses the nation -- where are we in this?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Ed, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a great question, and I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of the process, the middle of an open enrollment period that extends to March 31st.\xc2\xa0 There is no question on the issue of expansion of Medicaid that the more states that agree to do that, the better off the residents of those states are and the greater percentage of the American people who have access to that expanded Medicaid.</p>\n<p>And I would note that there are a number of states with Republican governors that have already taken action to expand Medicaid.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the right thing to do for the citizens of those states.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We have approximately 3 million people as of this point who have signed up in a private health insurance plan through the federal and state-based marketplaces since October 1st.\xc2\xa0 And since you know how low the numbers were in October and November, you know that the bulk of that has occurred in December and January.\xc2\xa0 Additionally -- and this goes to what you were talking about -- between October and December, over 6.3 million individuals were determined eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP.\xc2\xa0 Now, those numbers -- CMS has the details -- reflect I think in some cases, people who are already in Medicaid reenrolling, but it also reflects -- I think those numbers reflect the expanded Medicaid that we\'ve seen in those states that have taken action to expand Medicaid.</p>\n<p>So how are we doing?\xc2\xa0 I think that we\'re making significant progress.\xc2\xa0 But you won\'t hear anyone in this building, in HHS or CMS, say that we\'re done with this effort.\xc2\xa0 And it extends to March 31st; there\'s a lot of work that needs to be done; there\'s a lot of attention that needs to be paid to make sure the website is functioning effectively, making sure that as problems arise if they do arise, that action is taken to resolve them on behalf of those Americans who are clearly seeking insurance.\xc2\xa0 But having said that, it\'s certainly the case that we are seeing a website and marketplaces, the federal marketplaces, functioning much more effectively than they were early in this process.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s, believe me, a welcome development.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Last one, on transparency.\xc2\xa0 You had the editor-in-chief of The New York Times, Jill Abramson, say yesterday that she believes this is the most secretive White House she\'s ever dealt with.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to something when -- you\'ve dealt with issues of transparency, of access around here; you\'ve dealt with questions -- I think she was specifically referring to leak cases and her concerns about leak investigations.\xc2\xa0 How do you respond to the editor of The New York Times on that?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I would say this -- as was reported in The New York Times I think a while ago, the investigations I think that she\'s referring to, a number of them were begun under the Bush administration, they were not begun by this administration.\xc2\xa0 I would have been fascinated to see the stories had this administration chosen to drop investigations started by the previous administration, A.\xc2\xa0 B, I think you\'ve seen the steps that we\'ve taken, the attorney general has taken, to work with organizations, journalistic organizations and make clear that the President\'s principle that reports ought not to be accused of a crime for doing their jobs, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the approach we take.</p>\n<p>And I think -- look, it\'s interesting, when we\'re talking about The New York Times, in my first few months here working for the Vice President, I escorted a prominent reporter for The New York Times across the street to the OEOB where he was going to meet with some folks in the NSC -- some mid-level people, policy people in the NSC.\xc2\xa0 And he said that for the previous eight years he had not been allowed to talk to any of those people.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So you guys are the experts.\xc2\xa0 You know and can measure whether or not we provide as much or more access as previous administrations.\xc2\xa0 What I have no doubt about is that we don\'t provide as much as you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\xc2\xa0 And if I ever heard reporters in front of me tell me that they had enough information, I\xe2\x80\x99d call up their editors and say you all should be fired.\xc2\xa0 And that\'s not how this works.</p>\n<p>And so we work every day -- Josh and I and others -- to provide as much access as possible.\xc2\xa0 When it comes to access to the President, you know that I have a whole sheaf of statistics that demonstrate how he\xe2\x80\x99s taken many questions from the press corps for sustained periods of time, and the number of interviews he\xe2\x80\x99s given, which far exceeds those of his immediate two predecessors.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The President\xe2\x80\x99s former campaign manager joined Priorities USA.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m wondering -- a couple of questions about that.\xc2\xa0 Did Mr. Messina alert the President that he was going to do this?\xc2\xa0 And since Priorities USA is going to support -- or try to support Hillary Clinton, does that suggest that the President himself is supporting Hillary Clinton?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think Jim Messina is an independent American citizen.\xc2\xa0 He\xe2\x80\x99s not affiliated with the President at the White House.\xc2\xa0 The campaign is over.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Yes, but the two spent more hours together probably than any other -- than the President did probably with anybody else during the election I would imagine.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 No, I think that\'s not the case because the campaign was run out of Chicago.\xc2\xa0 But not to say that -- obviously Jim worked here and he\xe2\x80\x99s close to the President.\xc2\xa0 But what he does and what an independent third-party organization does is not something that is coordinated with the White House.\xc2\xa0 The President is focused on what he can do in 2014 and 2015 and 2016 as President, with the unbelievable privilege and opportunity to be the CEO of an organization that has more capacity to do good in the country and the world than any other. And that\'s what he\xe2\x80\x99s focused on.\xc2\xa0 What 2016 looks like I promise is not something that\'s on his mind.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 But did he -- I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I am not privy to every conversation the President has with the variety of people who have worked with him in the past.</p>\n<p>Kristen.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, thanks.\xc2\xa0 There are reports that Pope Francis is going to visit the United States next year.\xc2\xa0 Can you confirm that?\xc2\xa0 Has the Vatican contacted the administration?\xc2\xa0 Do you know anything --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I certainly can\'t.\xc2\xa0 Maybe the State Department. I don\'t know.\xc2\xa0 I think that would be great, personally.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t -- you know the President is looking forward to his meeting and visit, but I don\'t have any information about the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s travels.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And I want to go back to Sochi.\xc2\xa0 You have said that the administration will provide whatever assistance Russia requests, and I just want to be clear on that point.\xc2\xa0 Has Russia actually requested any assistance particularly over the past 24 hours?\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen yet another video surface threatening attacks.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\'t have detail on those conversations.\xc2\xa0 I can say that we\xe2\x80\x99ve made clear that we\xe2\x80\x99re ready to provide whatever assistance we can that the Russians would request.</p>\n<p>I think that what we\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavor as the games come closer to provide as much information as we can to you.\xc2\xa0 But in terms of those back and forth conversations, I just don\'t have a lot of detail that I can give you.\xc2\xa0 I would point to what I said before. We have cooperation with the Russians when it comes to the diplomatic security and FBI agents that will be in Sochi, helping with security for the U.S. team and delegation and spectators.\xc2\xa0 We continue to work with and consult with and discuss with the Russians the security situation and anything we can do to provide assistance.\xc2\xa0 And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that we always want more information, and we always want to be able to do more if we can.\xc2\xa0 But I don\'t have a lot of detail beyond that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 During an interview earlier today with Peter Alexander in which Mitt Romney was asked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you think the President has handled the situation with Russia, his interactions directly with Vladimir Putin?\xe2\x80\x9d -- and Romney responded, \xe2\x80\x9cPutin has outperformed our President time and time again on the world stage.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 What\xe2\x80\x99s your reaction to that statement?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I obviously disagree with that.\xc2\xa0 I think that the President has a relationship with President Putin that is focused on cooperation where the United States and Russia can cooperate, and clearly expressed differences where we have differences.\xc2\xa0 And the ability to have the deep differences that we have and to express them and to make clear our views on those differences, as well as to move forward in areas where we can cooperate, has served the interests of the United States, served the interests of the American people, as well as our allies overseas.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And I think that that is demonstrated in the P5-plus-1 negotiations, for example.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated in the relationship we\xe2\x80\x99ve had with Russia when it comes to making sure that we can get necessary supplies and assistance to our troops in Afghanistan.\xc2\xa0 And there are a host of other ways where that approach, that very pragmatic approach in U.S.-Russia relations has paid benefits to the American people and our national security.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Does that type of a statement, that sentiment undercut at all the President\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to work with Putin, particularly at this time when you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to insist --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think there are a lot of opinions expressed every day about U.S. policy, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s approach to various policies.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that that has a problematic impact.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 And finally, on Syria, Jay, we\xe2\x80\x99re just learning that the Syrian opposition will meet with the Syrian government delegation for the first time, face-to-face, on Saturday.\xc2\xa0 I want to get your reaction to that.\xc2\xa0 And what is your level of optimism that there will actually be any progress that comes from the conversation?\xc2\xa0 Apparently there is going to be a short one in the morning and then potentially a longer one later in the day.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I know that Joint Special Representative Brahimi has been very engaged in this process in first delaying the trilateral meeting to allow for more preparation.\xc2\xa0 And obviously progress is important and meetings between the opposition and the government are welcome, but we are under no illusion that this is not going to be a very difficult process.\xc2\xa0 But there\xe2\x80\x99s no other alternative to resolving the situation in Syria that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include a political negotiated settlement.\xc2\xa0 And hopefully, the meetings that have begun already and the ones that will take place will mark the beginning of what may be a long road, but hopefully will be a road that does lead to that negotiated political settlement.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Going back to last year\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union, the President, as Presidents do, asked Congress for a lot of stuff, and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get very much of it.\xc2\xa0 According to one analysis I saw, of the 41 things he asked for he got two of them and they were sort of no-brainers like the Violence Against Women Act.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 If only.\xc2\xa0 Boy, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t treated like a no-brainer at the time.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Of course, true enough.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Unnecessary opposition to it.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Was he surprised by how little Congress took up of his ideas, or disappointed?\xc2\xa0 I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to gauge how he felt about the last year as --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 The President shares in the American people\xe2\x80\x99s frustration with the obstructionism that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, the inertia we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in Congress, the occasional or often frequent refusal to work together on common-sense, middle-of-the-road proposals that advance the interests of the middle class.\xc2\xa0 But there is also -- as we talked about at the end of last year and early this year -- reason to hope that there\xe2\x80\x99s the potential for making some more progress with Congress even as the President makes clear that he will take action that he can that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require congressional legislative approval or action.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So it was modest, but it was not modest compared to what we\xe2\x80\x99d seen in previous years, when we saw the success that Senator Murray and Congressman Ryan had in negotiating a budget agreement.\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s not a grand bargain, but when you see the omnibus pass with bipartisan support in both houses, you see the government funded at levels that I think eliminated the sequester for 60 percent of non-defense discretionary spending so that we can make the necessary investments in early childhood education and SelectUSA and other priorities of the President, that\xe2\x80\x99s progress.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s good news for the American people.\xc2\xa0 And sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that smaller steps in the right direction are still steps in the right direction.</p>\n<p>So the President remains hopeful that this year we can see more progress from Congress -- that this year we can see action on immigration reform; we can see action on the minimum wage; we can see action on a host of the President\xe2\x80\x99s priorities that are of the kind that have in the past and can in the future enjoy bipartisan support.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So he\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly aim high.\xc2\xa0 Presidents ought to aim high. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any President has ever gone before Congress and said, I hope to do this, this, this and this with you, that year and at the end of the year discovered that his list was too short, that everything got done.\xc2\xa0 But this President is very optimistic about this year.\xc2\xa0 We are poised as a country to advance our recovery, to grow more and create more jobs.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And the first priority of Congress ought to be to do no harm, to not get in the way of that potential.\xc2\xa0 And then it ought to look at ways that it can help in the effort to make the economy grow faster, make the middle class more secure, provide more opportunity for all Americans.\xc2\xa0 And if they do that, I think the American people can look back and say, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re Democratic or Republican or independent, that Washington did okay -- did pretty well by me in the year 2014.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly what the President hopes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that the sort of marginal success rate last year is not putting a dark rain cloud over his head going forward?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any question that there was -- the American people had a lot of reason to be frustrated by Washington last year.\xc2\xa0 There was a wholly unnecessary, ideologically-driven shutdown of the government.\xc2\xa0 We had threats to default again.\xc2\xa0 And we had -- and this is on us -- an extremely poor launch to the health care website.\xc2\xa0 Those reasons certainly did not make Americans feel better about Washington.\xc2\xa0 But at the end of the year, as I noted, we saw some progress, bipartisan progress.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We believe very strongly that the economy is poised to strengthen further and create more jobs, and we ought to move forward as a nation.\xc2\xa0 We ought to work together here in Washington.\xc2\xa0 We ought to work together across the country.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why the President will be calling on stakeholders who aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily members of Congress to work with him to help the middle class, help the manufacturing sector grow, help the cause of educating our children move forward.\xc2\xa0 And if we can do all that, and pass a few important bills, we, the American people, will be in a lot better shape at the end of this year, and that will be a good thing.</p>\n<p>Steve.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Will the President take the opportunity on Tuesday night to defend the nuclear deal, interim nuclear deal with Iran, given the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s facing such skepticism in Congress?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Steve, again, without going into specifics about the speech the President will give, I think that State of the Union addresses tend to encompass a number of subjects, both foreign and domestic.\xc2\xa0 And I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to detail what the President is going to talk about, but there is a certain tradition to the form.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>So setting aside the State of the Union address, I can say that the President has been very clear about why he believes -- and he knows the American people join him overwhelmingly in this belief -- that it would be far better to ensure through a verifiable, transparent agreement with the Iranians that Iran will not and cannot obtain a nuclear weapon than to have to resort to force, for example.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Now, he takes no options off the table, and he will not take any option off the table in dealing with this very important issue.\xc2\xa0 But he believes it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the right and responsible thing to do to test the hypothesis that Iran may be willing to negotiate a comprehensive solution to this challenge; to come clean, if you will, and get right with the international community and its international obligations; to take the steps necessary to provide the assurance to the P5-plus-1 and everyone else with great concern about Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program that they have forsaken their ambitions for nuclear weapons.\xc2\xa0 So he certainly feels strongly about that.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just going back to these statements the Iranian leaders made, which you spoke about yesterday, regardless of whether they\xe2\x80\x99re accurate or not or whether they\xe2\x80\x99re part of some domestic spin operation, do they make it more difficult to build support in Washington for this nuclear deal?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I think that everyone with a keen interest in this issue here in Washington and around the world is focused on what Iran does:\xc2\xa0 whether or not Iran abides by its commitments; whether or not Iran takes the actions prescribed in the Joint Plan of Action.\xc2\xa0 And so far, we are seeing in these early stages Iran comply with its obligations.\xc2\xa0 Those are actions, those aren\xe2\x80\x99t words.\xc2\xa0 And that\xe2\x80\x99s what we pay attention to, and I think that that\xe2\x80\x99s what the folks around Washington and the world who pay the most attention to this challenge are focused on.</p>\n<p>What I can\xe2\x80\x99t say with any assurance is where we\xe2\x80\x99ll be in six months.\xc2\xa0 Obviously a challenge like this is a difficult one to resolve, and these are going to be tough negotiations.\xc2\xa0 But what has I think been made clear by us and other participants in the P5-plus-1 is that the purpose of the approach we took and the fact that we left the sanctions regime in place and very severe sanctions in place, and the capacity to turn back on even the modest sanctions relief that was provided as part of this agreement reflects the fact that there are no guarantees that Iran is going to take the steps necessary to reach an agreement with the P5-plus-1 in the end.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely the right thing to do to pursue it the way that we\xe2\x80\x99ve pursued it and to reach this interim agreement, which halts progress on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, rolls it back in some cases, while we test whether or not Iran is serious about reaching a final agreement.</p>\n<p>Jessica.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Just a follow-up.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 On the subject of Iran, the Secretary General of the IAEA says he\xe2\x80\x99s asking the P5-plus-1 and others for more budget and people to staff inspections in Iran, basically to beef up the verification operation.\xc2\xa0 Is the White House aware of that and ready to chip in?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, we obviously believe that the role played by the IAEA is very important here.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything on that request.\xc2\xa0 I would refer you to State Department.\xc2\xa0 We can take the question.\xc2\xa0 But it\xe2\x80\x99s very important that the IAEA be able to fulfill the responsibilities it\xe2\x80\x99s taken on in monitoring the implementation of this agreement.</p>\n<p>Sorry, I think I said Roger.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, on the two-year budget agreement, there was a budget cap for fiscal \xe2\x80\x9915, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be having the budget come up now March 4th.\xc2\xa0 Does the President feel bound by the discretionary number that is in that bill, or can he just propose something different in the budget itself?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Roger, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get ahead of the release of the budget.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 It\xe2\x80\x99s more of a theory thing.\xc2\xa0 Does he have a problem --</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 More of a theory thing?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 I would look to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the past, and I think --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve never had anything like this in the past.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 You mean an actual budget agreement?\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 With a specific discretionary number.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 With the specifics, that gets into what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be in the budget, even as a top line, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that.\xc2\xa0 I urge you to wait for the budget.\xc2\xa0 And Amy or I, or somebody, or Josh will get back to you if we have anything more\xc2\xa0 -- and everybody else -- to add to that.</p>\n<p>Just if I could, I just wanted to note -- I knew that I\xe2\x80\x99d discussed this earlier in a meeting -- that we are, in fact, aware that because of the intrusive monitoring and verification required under the Joint Plan of Action, the IAEA made need additional support and we are fully prepared to support the IAEA, and we encourage all member states to make contributions toward this important effort should they be necessary.\xc2\xa0 And I would note that some member states have already said they would -- indicated they are prepared to do that.\xc2\xa0 So we urge all member states to do that if it\xe2\x80\x99s necessary.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So you support it?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 We support it, so, yes.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 One other question.\xc2\xa0 On the State of the Union, can you give us a little sketch as to where the President is in the process?\xc2\xa0 Is he practicing right now, or is he still editing?\xc2\xa0 How many drafts?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number of drafts, but drafts have been going back and forth --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Dozens?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a number.\xc2\xa0 That\xe2\x80\x99s probably a little high.\xc2\xa0 But for those of you who have covered the President for some time and know how this works -- and he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a writer himself, and on speeches like this he really is the chief speechwriter.\xc2\xa0 He works very closely with his Director of Speechwriting, Cody Keenan, on this effort.\xc2\xa0 But we\xe2\x80\x99re still -- it\xe2\x80\x99s still being worked on, the writing of it, and so that process is ongoing.</p>\n<p>Cheryl, last one.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Week ahead, please?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And then I\xe2\x80\x99ll have my week ahead.\xc2\xa0 Cheryl.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Thanks.\xc2\xa0 Yesterday, the mayors were here and one of their chief concerns is how to upgrade their infrastructure, the big question being how to pay for it.\xc2\xa0 Did the White House or Cabinet officials or anyone discuss flexibility or ways that cities can upgrade their infrastructure?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific readout of conversations like that.\xc2\xa0 I can tell you that we have been very concerned and aggressive about the need to invest in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 Mayors know, because they\xe2\x80\x99re on the ground, about how important these investments are both to the future economic growth of their cities and regions and to the job creation needs that they have right now.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed very creative ways to move forward when it comes to making the substantial investments we need to make as a country in our infrastructure.\xc2\xa0 We\xe2\x80\x99ve proposed a grand bargain for jobs, if you will, when it comes to tying corporate tax reform, closing loopholes and lowering the rates as part of a package that would include substantial investments in our infrastructure, and we\'re very serious about the need to do that.\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\tAnd we completely agree with the urgency that mayors express.\xc2\xa0 Because we\'ve said before, as we continue to grow, I think if you talk to CEOs, you talk to mayors and others, there\'s an impediment out there, not just in the near term but the medium- and long term, towards further economic growth that\xe2\x80\x99s caused by insufficient, inadequate or antiquated infrastructure.</p>\n<p>And we need to -- if we make those investments, the positive benefit is compounded economically when we can get goods through ports more quickly, when our roads are better and our highways more efficient.\xc2\xa0 And the economic benefit of those kinds of investments compounds year after year after year.\xc2\xa0 So the President is very interested in working with mayors, working with Congress, working with others to make sure that we make those investments.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 So is that something Congress then really would need to do?\xc2\xa0 I\'m going with the pen versus Congress.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Every tool in the toolbox is the approach we\'re taking.</p>\n<p>Week ahead, week ahead.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Jay, one on India.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Goyal, sure.</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 India is on high alert as India celebrates on Sunday the public day of India.\xc2\xa0 And even Americans are being cautioned during this holiday, during this time, because (inaudible) are preparing from Pakistan and Afghanistan to attack in India on Indians and foreigners.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 And the question --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is there any talk -- has the President spoke with the Prime Minister of India or any -- FBI or any other intelligence?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any presidential conversations or White House conversations to report to you.\xc2\xa0 You might try the State Department on this kind of matter.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Let me give you the week ahead.\xc2\xa0 On Monday, the President will attend meetings at the White House.\xc2\xa0 On Tuesday, the President will deliver his State of the Union address at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\xc2\xa0 The Vice President, the First Lady and Dr. Biden will attend.\xc2\xa0 More details about the President\'s schedule for the remainder of the week --</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Come on.</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 -- will be released as they become available.\xc2\xa0 We\'re still -- you know.\xc2\xa0 Major, I promise you, when we have it pinned down, we will get it to you.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Have you settled on the long-term unemployment event on Wednesday?</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates on the schedule for you, Jim.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Q\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Is he going to travel, though, at the end of the week after the State of the Union?\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>MR. CARNEY:\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t have any updates for you.\xc2\xa0 (Laughter.)\xc2\xa0 Sorry, brother.\xc2\xa0 Well, have a great weekend.\xc2\xa0 We\'ll get you more information as we can.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>END\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<br/>\n\t1:26 P.M. EST</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
